From collecting information, reference images, organization, to modeling, texturing, unwrapping, lighting, animation, post-processing, and more.</p><p><strong>BAR MODELING</strong></p><p>In the first 13 lessons lasting about 2 hours and 20 minutes, <strong>we’ll turn a house</strong> found on Google Maps i<strong>nto a bar using modeling techniques</strong>.</p><p>In this part of the tutorial, <strong>I’ll show you how to model fast using shortcut keys and modifiers</strong>, and how to make a low-poly model look detailed in the camera, creating shaders to bring out as much detail as possible.</p><p><strong>BAR INTERIOR</strong></p><p>In the second part of the tutorial, we will model and texture the bar from the inside.</p><p>We’ll use a lot of emissive shaders here, and since the bar is farther from the camera, <strong>I’ll show you an easy way to make it look highly detailed without spending a lot of time.</strong></p><p><strong>CREATING THE ENVIRONMENT</strong></p><p>With the bar completed, we’ll move on to creating a cinematic scene around it.</p><p><strong>In this part, we’ll cover everything you need to create a cinematic scene</strong> — from camera setup and render settings to lighting and composition. I’ll show you how to achieve a cinematic, misty look using volumetrics, where to find great free models, how to create materials, and more.</p><p><strong>At the end of the tutorial, you will be able to create the animation from the video above as well as much more.</strong></p><p>With around six years of experience in Blender, I’m excited to share many of the things I've learned along the way.</p><p><strong>ASSETS INCLUDES</strong></p><p>- Smart trees asset pack</p><p>- Ground photo-scans </p><p>- Trash-garbage photo scans</p><p>- 6 house models</p><p>- final .blend file</p>",

Just follow me and discover the ways of making great digital art!<br>During the process I will tell you what I'm thinking at all times, so you get a deeper understanding of digital art.</p><p>At the start I'm going to give you an overview for Krita so you know the basics of using this amazing program.</p><p>We're going to continue by collecting ideas for an artwork and forging them into a pleasing composition by using art and design principles.</p><p>Then we're going to make a sketch for the actual artwork. Which we'll follow up by carefully filling everything with the according colors and details.</p><p>So in the end you will have a full value artwork that has (hopefully) taught you many generally applicable principles about art. So you should be able to repeat this process for an infinite amount of your future artworks.</p><p>I'm going to conclude the course by giving you more general advice for your art journey and showing you how you can progress consistently as an artist.</p><p>And that's pretty much it. Watch the lessons to find out what it's all about!</p><p>I'm excited to see how it works for you :)</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Ready to learn Claude AI without boring tutorials?</strong></p><p>This isn't another dry AI course filled with technical jargon and theory. This is <strong>learning by making things you actually care about.</strong></p><p>You'll master Claude AI by building real creative projects from scratch - worldbuilding documents, tabletop game systems, stories, manga scripts, and marketing campaigns. Every lesson teaches you Claude fundamentals through hands-on work that results in portfolio-worthy projects.</p><p><strong>Why This Course Works</strong></p><p>Most AI courses teach you commands and features in isolation. We teach you <strong>collaboration workflows</strong> - how to brainstorm with Claude, iterate on ideas, manage long projects, convert formats, and actually finish creative work. You learn Claude by using it the way real creatives do.</p><p>What You'll Actually Build</p><ul><li><p><strong>Original alien civilization</strong> with complete worldbuilding and lore</p></li><li><p><strong>Tabletop RPG system</strong> with rules, characters, monsters, and adventures</p></li><li><p><strong>Multi-format content</strong> - the same story as prose, manga script, and game design doc</p></li><li><p><strong>Marketing campaigns</strong> with strategy, content plans, and analytics</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Skills That Transfer Everywhere</strong></p><p>While we build games and stories, you're learning universal Claude skills: effective prompting, task decomposition, iterative refinement, format conversion, project management, and professional workflows. Apply these to writing, design, marketing, education, or any creative field.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who This Course is For</strong></p><p>Perfect for creative professionals, writers, artists, designers, and small business owners who want to learn AI through doing, not watching. Ideal if you're intimidated by technical AI courses or frustrated by tools that feel robotic. This teaches you to work <em>with</em> Claude as a creative partner, not just prompt a machine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>No Prerequisites Needed</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zero coding experience required. Zero game design knowledge required. Zero marketing background required. We teach you Claude AI - the creative projects are just our fun, engaging teaching method.</strong></p><p>Course Structure</p><p><strong>Section 1:</strong> Get started immediately - setup, interface, and your first project<br><strong>Section 2:</strong> Master fundamentals through worldbuilding exercises<br><strong>Section 3:</strong> Advanced techniques via game system design<br><strong>Section 4:</strong> Format conversion superpowers<br><strong>Section 5:</strong> Expert personas and professional workflows<br><strong>Section 6:</strong> Real-world marketing and business applications</p><p>Your Instructor</p><p>I've spent years working with AI tools in creative production, figuring out what actually works versus what sounds good in theory. This course distills those hard-won lessons into a fun, practical learning path that respects your time and intelligence.</p><p>What Makes This Different</p><ul><li><p><strong>Project-based learning</strong> that produces real portfolio pieces</p></li><li><p><strong>No fluff</strong> - every lesson teaches practical skills you'll use immediately</p></li><li><p><strong>Human teaching style</strong> - encouraging, witty, and actually helpful</p></li><li><p><strong>Multiple creative domains</strong> - see how Claude adapts across different work</p></li><li><p><strong>Completion focus</strong> - you'll finish projects, not just start them</p></li></ul><p>By the end of this course, you'll have multiple finished creative projects AND the Claude AI skills to tackle whatever creative challenges you face next.</p><p><strong>Ready to build something cool?

  "description": "<p>Topic of this course is a wheel (rim and tyre) which in it's design hides many interesting SolidWorks features. It's an amazing workflow which can be implemented in many other types of 3D models so I really hope you will be able to complete the course well and integrate this knowledge in some of your upcoming projects.</p><p>Aside from simply ,,using features\" I was heavily focused on maximizing the use of the ,,feature tree\" which allows SolidWorks users to literally go back and forward in time, manipulate different dimensions, features and their order which in total defines the 3D model.</p><p>Perhaps the most important part of the course is understanding this back and forth capability and how to use it. It allows you to make many mistakes but if you've built your model cleanly from the start you will be awarded and SolidWorks will allow you to change many things ,,in past\" and then come back again and see the results of these changes in real-time.</p><p>You might also notice I've tried to keep the number of sketches and sketch elements as low as possible so we can solely focus on the process itself and main features like surface design, cuts, mirrors and similar.</p><p>I did not intend to put a too heavy workflow on your shoulders so this is why I also pre-made couple of small components and your duty will be to incorporate them in already existing model, which is of course something you will learn how to do if you haven't had a chance earlier.</p><p>At the end you will get a glimpse of how the 3D rendering process looks like and how easy it actually is to go from a finished model&nbsp; to a rendered but realisticaly looking image.</p><p>Make sure to leave a comment and let me know how you liked the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Stop dreaming about a career in engineering design and start building it.</strong> Welcome to the most definitive, all-encompassing, and career-transforming <strong>Autodesk Inventor 2025</strong> course ever created. This is not just another software tutorial; it is a complete professional incubator designed to take you from an absolute beginner, with zero prior experience, and forge you into a confident, highly-skilled, and <strong>job-ready mechanical design</strong> professional. We have meticulously engineered this program to be the equivalent of <strong>five individual courses in one</strong>, delivering unparalleled value and a skill set that will make you an indispensable asset in today's competitive engineering landscape.</p><p>Are you tired of courses that just show you where the buttons are, leaving you to figure out the <em>why</em> and the <em>how</em> on your own? Do you worry that the skills you're learning aren't what employers are actually looking for? I understand that frustration completely. That is why I have invested <strong>over six months of intensive research and real-world application</strong> to build this course from the ground up. I didn't just sit in front of a camera; I lived and breathed <strong>Autodesk Inventor</strong>, applying every advanced technique and professional workflow to complex, real-world engineering projects. I dissected the challenges, streamlined the processes, and uncovered the secrets to maximum productivity. After achieving remarkable results and refining these methods to perfection, I made it my mission to distill this hard-won knowledge into a single, transformative learning experience. This course is the culmination of that journey—a direct, no-nonsense pipeline to the exact skills that employers are desperately seeking and are willing to pay a premium for.</p><p><strong>What Makes This Course The Ultimate Choice?</strong></p><p>In a sea of online courses, you need to know you're making the right investment.

You’ll have:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong>solid foundation</strong> in SketchUp’s essential tools.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>ability </strong>to take an idea and turn it into a 3D project.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>confidence</strong> to keep practicing and even start working on your own designs.</p></li></ul><p>This course is perfect for <strong>beginners </strong>who want a guided, structured project to start with — but also for hobbyists, students, or professionals in fields like <strong>architecture</strong>, <strong>interior design</strong>, or <strong>product design</strong> who want to add SketchUp to their toolkit.</p><p>And remember: if at any point you feel you’d benefit from a more personalized approach, I also offer <strong>1-on-1 training</strong> where we can go deeper into your goals.</p><p>I can’t wait to see how far you’ll go — let’s start building! </p>",

  "description": "<p>Discover the power of parametric design by recreating one of the world’s most iconic architectural masterpieces — Jean Nouvel’s Louvre Abu Dhabi. Known for its breathtaking dome and the poetic “Rain of Light” effect, this building is a perfect case study to unlock the creative potential of Grasshopper.</p><p><br></p><p>This course takes you on a step-by-step journey into parametric modelling. Starting from the basics, you’ll learn how to break down complex forms into manageable components and transform them into dynamic geometries. Through hands-on lessons, you’ll master the logic of Grasshopper, explore advanced modelling techniques, and simulate the dome’s striking interplay of light and shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>But the course goes beyond technical skills. By reconstructing the Louvre Abu Dhabi, you’ll gain a deeper appreciation for how digital tools can be used to analyse, reimagine, and innovate within architecture. You’ll see how parametric workflows not only help solve complex design problems but also open new doors for creativity.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether you are an architecture student eager to expand your design toolkit, a professional looking to sharpen your computational skills, or simply a design enthusiast fascinated by landmark buildings, this course is designed for you. No prior expertise is required — just curiosity and a willingness to experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the course, you won’t just have recreated an architectural icon. You’ll have developed the skills, confidence, and inspiration to bring your own complex ideas to life through Grasshopper and parametric design.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Ready to dive into the world of 3D? This course is your complete guide to becoming proficient in <strong>Blender</strong>, the powerful and free 3D software that's taking the industry by storm.</p><p><strong>Why Blender?</strong></p><p>From video games and architectural design to product visualization and animation, 3D skills are more in demand than ever. But starting out can feel overwhelming. Blender offers a single, comprehensive platform to learn everything you need. We'll start from the absolute basics, demystifying Blender's interface and core principles so you can build a strong foundation and unleash your creativity.</p><p><strong>What You'll Learn:</strong></p><p>Unlike CAD programs that focus on precise, mathematical designs, Blender is a <strong>mesh-based modeling tool</strong>. This means we'll be building everything using vertices, edges, and faces—the building blocks of organic shapes, characters, and artistic creations. If you've ever used other popular mesh-based programs like ZBrush, Maya, or 3ds Max, you'll feel right at home with Blender's core logic.</p><p>Throughout the course, we'll cover:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Modeling:</strong> Learn different techniques to create a wide range of models.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sculpting:</strong> Shape and refine organic forms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Animation:</strong> Bring your creations to life.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shading:</strong> Master materials and textures.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lighting &amp; Rendering:</strong> Set the mood and produce stunning final images.</p></li><li><p><strong>Compositing:</strong> Combine different elements to polish your scenes.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Who Is This Course For?</strong></p><p>This course is designed for anyone who wants to learn 3D. No prior experience is needed!</p><ul><li><p><strong>Beginners:</strong> If you're new to 3D, this is the perfect starting point.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hobbyists:</strong> Create game characters, objects for 3D printing, or digital art.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aspiring Professionals:</strong> Build a solid portfolio for a career in game development, animation, or architectural visualization.</p></li><li><p><strong>Blender Users:</strong> Refresh your foundational knowledge and get up to speed with the latest interface.</p></li></ul><p>If you're ready to open the door to the digital world of 3D, let's get started.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course brings together <strong>three stunning FX projects in Houdini</strong> into one complete learning experience. Whether you are a beginner or an intermediate artist, you will learn step by step how to create cinematic visual effects while building real, finished projects you can showcase.</p><p>Project 1: Zombie Cloth Disintegration</p><p>A crawling zombie gradually disintegrates into pieces using cloth simulation and a heat-driven effect. You’ll learn how to import characters from Mixamo, prepare them for FX, fracture geometry, apply vellum cloth simulations, and connect them with a temperature source for a gradual, controlled disintegration. The project is finalized with rendering in Karma, color correction in After Effects, and sound design.</p><p>Project 2: Character Disintegration into Dust</p><p>Create one of the most iconic VFX shots: a character walking forward and dissolving into particles of dust. You’ll prepare geometry, use Boolean operations to define the disintegration source, replace body parts with particles, and control emission and particle timing. Finally, you’ll preview the effect with Houdini’s Flipbook tool for fast, high-quality results.</p><p>Project 3: Hourglass Sand Timer</p><p>Combine modeling, simulation, and rendering by building a realistic hourglass. You’ll model the glass body and base, simulate falling sand, set up caching for smooth playback, and add realistic shading, lighting, and rendering in Karma.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will:</p><ul><li><p>Be confident in creating <strong>particle-based and cloth-based disintegration effects</strong></p></li><li><p>Learn how to <strong>combine modeling, simulation, shading, and rendering</strong> in Houdini</p></li><li><p>Gain hands-on experience with <strong>Karma rendering, Flipbook previews, caching techniques, and After Effects finishing</strong></p></li><li><p>Have three complete cinematic projects in your portfolio, ready to share and build upon</p></li></ul><p>This course is designed to be <strong>beginner-friendly but powerful enough for intermediates</strong> looking to expand their Houdini skills. Each project is short, practical, and focused, giving you maximum results in minimum time.</p><p>Join now and create stunning FX projects — <strong>from sand to zombies and more!</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>Google Veo 3 represents the cutting edge of AI video generation technology. Whether you're a creative professional adapting to AI-powered workflows, a technical specialist evaluating generative models, or a business strategist navigating the synthetic media revolution, you need more than surface-level knowledge—you need mastery that you can prove.</p><p><strong>Master the Technology Redefining Video Production</strong></p><p>The synthetic media market is projected to reach <strong>USD 45.9 billion by 2032</strong>, and Google Veo 3 stands at the forefront. Announced at Google I/O 2024, Veo 3 isn't just another AI tool—it's Google's most sophisticated video generation model, producing high-definition 1080p videos exceeding one minute from text prompts. But describing it differs vastly from understanding how it works, where it excels, and critically, where it falls short.</p><p>This complete practice test suite gives you what theory alone cannot: the ability to think critically under pressure, identify technical nuances, and demonstrate comprehensive knowledge across 13 essential domains—from Latent Diffusion Models and spacetime attention to regulatory compliance and ethical deployment.</p><p><strong>Test your expertise across:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Architectural foundations: LDM technology, spacetime attention, and how Veo compares to Sora and Kling's Diffusion Transformers</p></li><li><p>Technical capabilities: Cinematic language interpretation, editing functions (inpainting/outpainting), and consistency maintenance</p></li><li><p>Industry applications: Real-world use cases in filmmaking, advertising, and social media content creation</p></li><li><p>Market dynamics: Google's strategic ecosystem advantage through YouTube integration and competitive positioning</p></li><li><p>Ethical challenges: Deepfakes, misinformation, data transparency, and the uncanny valley phenomenon</p></li><li><p>Regulatory frameworks: EU AI Act, US Executive Order 14110, Chinese mandates, and guild agreements (SAG-AFTRA, DGA)</p></li><li><p>Economic impact: Cost reduction models, market growth projections, and emerging business opportunities</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why Master Veo 3 Technology Now?</strong></p><p>The video production industry is experiencing its most significant disruption since digital editing replaced film. Studios report <strong>potential pre-production cost savings of 50-70%</strong> when leveraging AI video generation tools. Creative agencies are prototyping dozens of ad variations in hours rather than weeks. Independent creators are producing cinematic-quality content previously requiring five-figure budgets.</p><p>But here's the critical insight: knowing how to use Veo 3 is table stakes. The real competitive advantage belongs to professionals who understand its architectural limitations, can evaluate its output artifacts, anticipate regulatory compliance requirements, and strategically position AI-generated content within existing workflows. When a client asks whether Veo 3 can maintain character consistency across a 60-second narrative, you need to know not just \"yes\" or \"no,\" but understand the specific technical mechanisms (spacetime attention, latent space compression) that enable or constrain this capability.</p><p>The market is bifurcating rapidly. Professionals who deeply understand generative AI video technology—its capabilities, limitations, ethical implications, and regulatory landscape—are commanding premium consulting rates and strategic advisory roles. Those who view it as just another software tool risk commoditization as the technology becomes more accessible.</p><p><strong>What You'll Learn Through Intensive Practice</strong></p><p>This course delivers <strong>240 carefully crafted questions</strong> across 6 progressive practice tests, leveraging the <strong>testing effect</strong>—one of the most scientifically validated learning techniques. Every question becomes a learning opportunity through detailed explanations that connect concepts, challenge assumptions, and build genuine expertise.</p><p>You'll develop fluency with Veo 3's <strong>Latent Diffusion Model architecture</strong>, understanding why compressed latent space enables efficient high-resolution video generation and how spacetime attention mechanisms differ from Sora and Kling's Diffusion Transformers. You'll explore cinematic language interpretation, advanced editing capabilities (inpainting/outpainting), and examine real applications like the Donald Glover collaboration showcased at Google I/O 2024.</p><p>The course moves beyond technical specifications into strategic territory. You'll analyze Google's competitive moat through YouTube integration, assess industry applications across filmmaking and advertising, and understand what's practical given current limitations. Critically, you'll confront constraints head-on: the uncanny valley, output artifacts, inconsistent physics, and object permanence failures that appear even in demonstration footage.</p><p><strong>Navigate Complex Ethical and Regulatory Landscapes</strong></p><p>As AI video generation advances, ethical and regulatory challenges intensify. This course covers the evolving compliance landscape comprehensively: EU AI Act requirements for high-risk systems, US Executive Order 14110's mandates for digital watermarking, and China's Generative AI Service Management Measures. You'll examine SAG-AFTRA and Directors Guild agreements addressing AI's impact on creative labor, analyze Stanford's Foundation Model Transparency Index findings, and study deepfake countermeasures from SynthID watermarking to digital provenance systems.</p><p>This isn't compliance training for regulatory audits—it's strategic knowledge enabling you to anticipate requirements, design ethically sound deployment strategies, and advise organizations on responsible AI implementation before enforcement actions force reactive compliance.</p><p><strong>For Professionals Across Multiple Domains</strong></p><p><strong>Creative professionals and filmmakers</strong> gain technical literacy for informed AI specialist conversations and strategic workflow integration. <strong>Technical specialists and AI practitioners</strong> develop architectural fluency with LDMs and comparative analysis across competing approaches. <strong>Business strategists</strong> acquire market intelligence about the USD 45.9 billion synthetic media landscape and platform integration advantages.</p><p><strong>Compliance and legal professionals</strong> master the fragmented global regulatory landscape and guild agreement implications. <strong>Marketing specialists</strong> explore hyper-personalization opportunities and prototyping workflows reducing costs by 50-70%. <strong>Educators and researchers</strong> gain comprehensive knowledge of current capabilities, limitations, and likely evolution paths.</p><p><strong>6 Progressive Tests Building Comprehensive Mastery</strong></p><p><strong>Test 1 – Foundational Concepts</strong> (30 questions, 80 minutes): Validates understanding of Veo's announcement, core purpose, key terminology, and competitive landscape. Establishes baseline knowledge of Google's positioning and strategic objectives.</p><p><strong>Test 2 – Technical Principles and Architecture</strong> (35 questions, 100 minutes): Assesses deep comprehension of Latent Diffusion Models, spacetime attention mechanisms, and architectural comparisons with rival approaches. Develops technical literacy required for informed evaluation.</p><p><strong>Test 3 – Industry Impact and Applications</strong> (35 questions, 100 minutes): Tests practical knowledge of use cases across filmmaking, advertising, and social media. Examines strategic positioning and Google's ecosystem advantages through YouTube integration.</p><p><strong>Test 4 – Ethics, Regulation, and Limitations</strong> (40 questions, 115 minutes): Challenges understanding of complex topics including the uncanny valley, deepfake regulation, data transparency, and labor agreements. Addresses real-world deployment challenges.</p><p><strong>Test 5 – Comprehensive Practice Exam</strong> (65 questions, 180 minutes): Provides full-length self-assessment mixing questions from all domains and difficulty levels. Identifies knowledge gaps requiring additional study before final validation.</p><p><strong>Test 6 – Final Certification Simulator</strong> (65 questions, 180 minutes): Emulates the format, difficulty, and time pressure of a real certification exam. Focuses on complex, scenario-based questions requiring synthesis across multiple knowledge domains.</p><p>Each question includes detailed explanations for all answer options—not just correct answers. This approach transforms every question into a learning opportunity. When you select an incorrect answer, you don't just discover you were wrong; you understand why your reasoning was flawed, what the correct logic should have been, and how to avoid similar errors when analyzing real-world scenarios.</p><p><strong>Learn From Every Question, Right or Wrong</strong></p><p>This course's power lies in its 100% practice-based methodology. You won't sit through lectures—instead, you'll encounter scenarios forcing active engagement. Research on the testing effect demonstrates that retrieval practice produces significantly stronger retention than traditional study methods.</p><p>Multiple-choice questions test foundational knowledge. Multi-select questions require discriminating among partially correct options, developing nuanced thinking essential for real-world application. Scenario-based questions present realistic situations requiring knowledge synthesis across domains. Detailed explanations don't just identify correct answers—they explain reasoning behind incorrect options, common misconceptions, and connections between concepts, making your thinking process explicit and correctable.</p><p><strong>Your Strategic Investment in AI Literacy</strong></p><p>The AI video generation landscape evolves rapidly. Veo 3 represents late 2024's state of the art, but more capable models will emerge. The foundational knowledge you build—LDM architectures, attention mechanisms, ethical frameworks, regulatory landscapes, strategic dynamics—creates durable expertise transcending any single platform.</p><p>Professionals developing deep AI literacy now position themselves as strategic advisors and ethical guides as organizations navigate transformation. The market values those who understand how AI tools work, where they fail, and how to deploy them responsibly within complex constraints—not just those who can use them.</p><p><strong>Click \"Enroll Now\" and begin your journey from Veo 3 awareness to comprehensive mastery. Six progressive tests await—each designed to challenge your thinking, expose knowledge gaps, and build expertise that distinguishes true professionals in the age of AI-generated video.</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>Discover the art of building texture, depth, and flow through the modern medium of layered acrylic painting. In this course, contemporary artist Ekaterina Vygolova (Ekavy Arts) guides you through every stage of creating a sophisticated, dimensional abstract artwork — from preparing your surface to applying multiple layers of color and texture using a palette knife and glue.</p><p><br></p><p>You’ll start by learning how to properly prime your canvas or wood board, sketch the design, and build your tactile structure with glue lines. Then, you’ll move through a series of acrylic layers — blending tones, developing harmony, and sculpting depth. The result is a clean, modern artwork full of rhythm and movement.</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout the course, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of color composition, balance, and the importance of layering for visual impact. You’ll also discover how small variations in tone and knife movement can completely transform the mood of your piece. Each step is designed to help you connect with the creative process while achieving professional-looking results.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether you’re a beginner exploring texture techniques or an experienced artist expanding your skills, this course offers a relaxing, hands-on process designed to inspire and elevate your art practice.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the course, you’ll have completed your own finished piece — a professional-quality abstract artwork ready to display, gift, or sell.

  "description": "<p><strong>Stop losing hours to messy bakes and muddy renders—build a stylized lantern with clean UVs, smart materials, and a cinematic arc-shot that actually sells your work.</strong></p><p>I am Neil from 3D Tudor. Together with Luke, we guide you through a complete Blender → Substance 3D Painter → Blender pipeline: hard-surface modeling, disciplined UVs, robust baking, reusable Painter materials, then lighting, compositing, and an elegant arc-shot for your portfolio.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You will need Blender 4+ and Substance 3D Painter. If you can move, select, and navigate in Blender, you are set—everything else we will cover step by step.</strong></p><p>You will also get curated references, a matching render-backdrop texture, and an optional helper to speed up compositing inside Blender.</p><p>Here is what I have not talked about yet, but it quietly separates “nice prop” from “hire this artist now.” We will build a tiny art-direction playbook around the lantern: what story it tells, how that story informs edge softness, surface contrast, and where the viewer’s eye lands first. I will show you a quick way to pick three visual pillars (shape language, material read, and focal glow) and test every decision against them.</p><p><em>It sounds fancy, but it is just a ruthless way to avoid muddy, indecisive work.</em></p><p><br></p><p>What You Will Learn</p><p>● Blockout-to-bevel strategy, tidy stacks, and static-mesh cleanup for export.</p><p>● UV packing for consistent texel density and painless Painter bakes.</p><p>● Curvature/AO-driven wear, layered grunge control, and hand-painted accents.</p><p>● Reconstructing Blender shaders, HDRI plus motivated fills, compositor bloom/mist/contact pop.</p><p>● Camera arc-shot loop for clean presentation across ArtStation, Sketchfab, and reels.<br><br>We will also look at naming, versioning, and export discipline—the boring bits that keep you fast. You will leave with a consistent file structure, suffix rules for mesh and texture variants, and a simple “one-click” export preset that keeps scale and orientation bullet-proof between Blender and Substance 3D Painter. When a client asks for a tweak two weeks later, you will know exactly where to touch the pipeline without knocking everything over like Jenga.</p><p>Presentation matters, so we will build a thumbnail on purpose, not by accident. You will learn how focal length, camera height, and a single motivated rim light can make the silhouette read on a tiny screen.</p><p>Inside the Class Files</p><p><strong>References, a tuned backdrop texture, and an optional helper for faster stage and pass setup (a manual path is shown).</strong></p><p>Create your own stylized lantern: model → UV → bake → texture → render a short arc-shot loop. Use the included references, backdrop texture, and the optional helper for the compositor and stage. A manual setup path is shown if you prefer.</p><p>You will build a repeatable loop—decide, test, evaluate—that turns “I hope this works” into “I know why this works.” It is not magic. It is just good craft, done deliberately.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who This Course Is For</strong></p><p>● <strong>The Blender Tinkerer:</strong> You love modifiers and clean topology, and you want exports that behave.</p><p>● <strong>The Prop &amp; Game Artist:</strong> You care about UV discipline, predictable bakes, and scalable smart materials.</p><p>● <strong>The Stylised Realist:</strong> You like grounded PBR with purposeful wear, not sludge-mask chaos.</p><p>● <strong>The Portfolio Builder:</strong> You need a render flow that is repeatable and looks professional.<br></p><p><strong>Why This Course Stands Out</strong></p><p>● <strong>End-to-end, production-minded workflow</strong> you can repeat for your next five props.</p><p>● <strong>Stylised clarity</strong>—characterful materials that remain readable in engine and on thumbnails.</p><p>● <strong>Reusable assets and habits</strong>—materials, lighting, and stage that compound across projects.<br></p><p>What You Will Finish With</p><p>A fully modeled, UV’d, and textured fantasy lantern; a small library of reusable Painter materials; and a polished looped render for your portfolio.</p><p>In this Blender + Substance 3D Painter class, we go end-to-end: blockout, bevel strategy, static-mesh cleanup, UV packing, AO/curvature/normal bakes, stylised metal/wood/stone/glass stacks, emission that glows without clipping, and a polished arc-shot loop back in Blender with HDRI lighting and compositor bloom/mist/contact pop.</p><p><strong>Until next time, happy modelling everyone!</strong></p><p><strong>Neil – 3D Tudor</strong></p>",

Each step is explained in a practical and direct way to help you understand not only the technical operations but also the logic behind scene composition and design choices.</p><p>For modeling, we’ll use a method based on <strong>curves</strong>, a powerful and often overlooked technique that allows for exceptional precision and flexibility throughout the process.</p><p>Once modeling is complete, we’ll move to the <strong>lighting and rendering</strong> phase: we’ll set up the camera, study the light balance, and create a photographic atmosphere that enhances realism.</p><p>You’ll also learn how to work with <strong>UV Mapping, Texture Paint, Displacement, and Normal Maps</strong> to reproduce surfaces, reflections, and imperfections of the real world.</p><p>The course concludes with the <strong>final render</strong>, where all elements come together in a coherent and visually convincing result.</p><p>This course offers a clear and professional approach to managing a complete Blender project — perfect for anyone who wants to elevate their 3D visualization skills and achieve realistic, high-quality results.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Automotive sustainability is a hot topic. OEMs and suppliers are under pressure to decarbonize and adopt circularity. Engineers are the start point in this journey. Below is the overview of the course content.</p><p>Disclaimer: This course contains the use of artificial intelligence <strong>for audio creation.</strong></p><p><strong>Section 1: Introduction &amp; The Need for Circular Design </strong></p><p>This section sets the stage by explaining why circular design is critically important for automotive engineers <em>now</em>, contrasting it with the broken economics of linear design.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Introduction to Circular Design</strong>:</p><ul><li><ul><li><p><strong>Why Circular Design Matters NOW</strong>: Covers the key drivers including <strong>Regulatory Pressure</strong> (EU ESPR, Right to Repair, EPR), <strong>Cost Reality</strong> (raw material prices, supply chain disruptions), <strong>Market Demand</strong> (OEM circularity metrics), <strong>Revenue Opportunity</strong> (remanufacturing market growth), and <strong>Competitive Advantage</strong> (early movers).</p></li><li><p><strong>The Problem: Linear Design Economics Are Broken</strong>: Highlights the shortcomings of the traditional approach (design for lowest upfront cost, ignoring end-of-life). Discusses <strong>Hidden Costs</strong> (warranty, disposal, fines, material volatility) and <strong>Lost Revenue</strong> (95% material value lost in single-use designs). Emphasizes the <strong>Engineer's Role</strong> in long-term value creation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 2: The R-Strategy Hierarchy &amp; Core Principles </strong></p><p>This section introduces the fundamental framework for circularity – the R-Strategy Hierarchy – and then dives into the five core design principles that engineers can immediately apply.</p><p><strong>Course Content:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>The R-Strategy Hierarchy (ISO 59004)</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Understanding the different <strong>R-strategies</strong> from R0 (Refuse) to R8 (Recycle), ordered by increasing circularity and value retention.</p></li><li><p><strong>Applying the R-Hierarchy as a Decision Framework</strong>: Explains the <strong>Priority Order</strong> (start at R0, move down only when higher options aren't feasible) and the concept of <strong>Value Retention by Strategy Level</strong>. Introduces the <strong>Decision Tool</strong>: \"Why can't I apply R0? R1? R2?\"</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Core Circular Design Principles</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Core Principle #1: Design for Disassembly (DfD)</strong>: Defines the target (e.g., &lt;10 min to remove a module), provides an <strong>Implementation Checklist</strong> (mechanical fasteners, max 3 fastener types, clear pathways, visual indicators, accessible wear components), and an <strong>ROI Example</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Core Principle #2: Design for Modularity</strong>: Sets the goal (component swapping, upgrades), outlines <strong>Design Rules</strong> (group components by lifecycle, standardized interfaces, forward/backward compatibility, independent testing), and discusses <strong>Business Impact</strong> (enables PaaS).</p></li><li><p><strong>Core Principle #3: Material Selection Strategy</strong>: Prioritizes mono-materials, discusses the <strong>Material Decision Matrix</strong> (Durability, Recyclability, Recycled Content, Separability), importance of <strong>Labeling</strong> (ISO 11469), and <strong>Cost Reality</strong> of recycled materials.</p></li><li><p><strong>Core Principle #4: Design for Durability</strong>: Establishes the <strong>Mandate</strong> (exceed specs by 30-50%), details <strong>Engineering Practices</strong> (fatigue analysis, environmental testing, designing out failures, corrosion resistance, electronics protection), and presents the <strong>Business Case</strong> (reduced warranty, PaaS enablement).</p></li><li><p><strong>Core Principle #5: Design for Maintenance &amp; Repair</strong>: Defines the <strong>Requirement</strong> (serviceable part &lt;30 min with standard tools), outlines <strong>Implementation</strong> steps (access panels, avoid proprietary tools, self-diagnostics, digital manuals, spare parts availability), and highlights <strong>Revenue Opportunity</strong> from aftermarket parts.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Section 3: Circular Business Models, Regulations &amp; Metrics </strong></p><p>This section delves into how value is created and captured in a circular economy, the essential regulatory landscape, and the metrics needed to track progress.</p><p><strong>Course Content:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Circular Business Models: Where the Money Is</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Model 1: Product-as-a-Service (PaaS)</strong>: Retaining ownership, selling performance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Model 2: Remanufacturing</strong>: Taking back, restoring, reselling at a percentage of new price.</p></li><li><p><strong>Model 3: Parts Harvesting</strong>: Grading returned units, recombining good modules.</p></li><li><p><strong>Model 4: Second-Life Applications</strong>: Repurposing components (e.g., EV batteries for stationary storage).</p></li><li><p><strong>Building the Business Case: TCO Analysis</strong>: Compares full lifecycle costs, not just unit price, with an <strong>Example Calculation</strong> demonstrating significant cost reduction and new revenue streams from circular design.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Regulatory Landscape: What You Must Know</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>EU Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)</strong>: Requirements (durability, repairability scores, recycled content, DPP), Mandates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Right to Repair Legislation (EU &amp; US states)</strong>: Requirements (spare parts, tools, manuals), Enforcement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)</strong>: The \"polluter pays\" principle and its cost impact.</p></li><li><p><strong>ISO 59000 Series</strong>: Framework for measuring circular economy (ISO 59004, ISO 59020).</p></li><li><p><strong>Digital Product Passport (DPP): Your New Design Requirement</strong>: Defines what it is (digital twin), <strong>Required Data</strong> (BOM, manufacturing, lifetime, disassembly, repair history, R-strategies), <strong>Implementation</strong> (QR/RFID, blockchain/cloud), and <strong>Benefits</strong>.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Key Circularity Metrics to Track (ISO 59004)</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Material Circularity Indicator (MCI)</strong>: 0-1 score, target &gt;0.6.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recycled Content %</strong>: Minimum targets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recyclability Rate %</strong>: Target &gt;90% by weight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disassembly Time</strong>: &lt;10 min for key modules.</p></li><li><p><strong>Remanufacturability Score</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Repairability Index</strong>: Accessibility, documentation, spare parts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tool</strong>: Integrate into PLM/CAD workflow.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Section 4: Implementation, Overcoming Barriers &amp; Next Steps </strong></p><p>The final section equips engineers with practical strategies to implement circular design, address common organizational challenges, and outlines a clear path forward.</p><p><strong>Course Content:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Overcoming Barriers: Common Objections &amp; Responses</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Addresses objections like \"Circular design costs more upfront,\" \"Customers don't care about sustainability,\" \"No supply chain for recycled materials,\" and \"Remanufacturing cannibalizes new sales,\" providing data-driven <strong>Responses</strong>.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Implementation Roadmap: Your 90-Day Action Plan</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Outlines phases: <strong>Baseline Assessment</strong> (Week 1-2), <strong>Quick Wins</strong> (Week 3-4), <strong>Pilot Project</strong> (Week 5-8), <strong>Scale &amp; Integrate</strong> (Week 9-12), with specific <strong>Objectives</strong> and <strong>Key Actions</strong> for each.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Practical Exercise: R-Strategy Design Review Checklist</strong>: A checklist to guide design reviews using ISO 59004 alignment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resources &amp; Tools</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Lists relevant <strong>ISO Standards</strong> (59004, 59020, 14001).</p></li><li><p>Mentions <strong>Material Databases</strong> (GaBi, Ecoinvent, GRANTA MI).</p></li><li><p>Identifies <strong>Circularity Assessment Tools</strong> (Ellen MacArthur Foundation MCI Calculator, WBCSD Toolkit).</p></li><li><p>Points to <strong>Industry Networks</strong> (MERA, CLEPA).</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>The Engineer as Change Agent</strong>: Emphasizes the significant role of engineers in shaping the automotive industry, creating value, and transforming linear economics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong>: Summarizes the core messages of the lecture.</p></li><li><p><strong>Your Next Steps</strong>: Provides concrete, actionable tasks for engineers (This week, This month, This quarter) to apply their learning.</p><p><br></p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>",

From there, we move into <strong>technical content</strong>, covering structural fundamentals, steel basics, and foundations, before exploring the major building systems: <strong>HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection</strong>. You’ll also learn how clearly defined <strong>scopes of work</strong> prevent disputes, how <strong>schedules</strong> are built and controlled, and how <strong>budgets, contingencies, and change orders</strong> are managed throughout the project lifecycle.</p><p>This course is practical and scenario-driven, helping you connect concepts to the realities of construction projects. By the end, you will not only understand the engineering behind key systems, but also how to manage timelines, costs, and coordination across multiple trades.</p><p>Whether you are a <strong>student preparing to enter the industry</strong>, a <strong>young professional broadening your knowledge</strong>, or someone seeking to understand both the technical and business aspects of construction, this course equips you with the skills to follow a project confidently from <strong>design to delivery</strong>.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Master the complete architectural visualization and documentation pipeline using the industry's most accessible yet powerful software combination. This comprehensive course teaches you to create photorealistic visualizations and professional technical drawings through one complete single-family house project, demonstrating real-world workflows that practicing architects use daily.</p><p><strong>Integrated Architectural Software Mastery</strong></p><p>This course focuses on the synergy between three essential architectural tools: SketchUp for intuitive 3D modeling, V-Ray 6 for professional rendering, and LayOut for automated technical documentation. Unlike courses that teach software in isolation, you'll learn how these programs work together to create a seamless workflow from initial concept to final presentation.</p><p><strong>Real-World Project Foundation</strong></p><p>Work through an authentic two-story, 140-square-meter single-family house project - exactly the type of commission you'll encounter in professional practice. This realistic scale and complexity ensures you develop skills that transfer directly to your career, whether you're working independently or within an architectural firm.</p><p><strong>SketchUp Advanced Modeling Techniques</strong></p><p>Discover SketchUp's full potential beyond basic modeling. Master efficient workflows for architectural detailing, complex geometry creation, and model organization that maintains performance even in large projects. Learn professional modeling standards that ensure your models are both visually impressive and technically sound for construction documentation.</p><p><strong>Strategic Plugin Integration</strong></p><p>Expand SketchUp's capabilities with essential plugins that professional architects rely upon. Master BezierSpline for complex curved elements, FredoCorner for architectural filleting, Component Stringer for repetitive element placement, and Skatter 2 for sophisticated landscape development. These tools transform SketchUp from a basic modeler into a comprehensive architectural design platform.</p><p><strong>V-Ray 6 Professional Rendering</strong> Harness the latest V-Ray 6 features specifically designed for architectural visualization. Master new tools like Enmesh for efficient repetitive geometry, procedural cloud systems for realistic skies, and Camera clipping for architectural sections. These cutting-edge features place you ahead of professionals still using outdated rendering techniques.</p><p><strong>Multi-Scenario Lighting Mastery</strong></p><p>Create compelling visualizations across different times of day and weather conditions. Learn tested lighting setups that work reliably across various architectural projects - from warm morning light that highlights building details to dramatic evening scenes that showcase interior lighting design. These proven techniques eliminate the guesswork from architectural lighting.</p><p><strong>LayOut Professional Documentation</strong></p><p>Transform your 3D models into professional construction documents using LayOut's automated drawing generation. Master scaled drawing production, line weight control, dimensioning systems, and print preparation - all generated automatically from your SketchUp model. This workflow eliminates redundant drafting while maintaining professional drawing standards.</p><p><strong>Advanced V-Ray Post-Production</strong></p><p>Complete your visualization pipeline entirely within V-Ray using advanced post-production techniques that eliminate dependence on external software. Master Cryptomatte masking for precise element selection, color grading for mood enhancement, and professional finishing techniques that elevate your renders to portfolio quality.</p><p>Comprehensive 13-Hour Learning Experience</p><p>This intensive training program covers every aspect of the architectural workflow, ensuring you understand not just individual tools but how they integrate into efficient professional practice. Each lesson builds systematically toward complete project mastery.</p><p><strong>Professional Workflow Optimization</strong></p><p>Learn time-saving techniques and efficiency strategies that practicing architects use to meet project deadlines without compromising quality. Understand file organization, model management, and rendering optimization that scales from single projects to large architectural practices.</p><p><strong>Industry-Standard Deliverables</strong> Produce the complete range of architectural deliverables: photorealistic exterior visualizations, professional construction drawings, scaled plans and sections, and presentation-ready documentation that meets professional standards for client presentations and permit submissions.</p><p><strong>Perfect for Architectural Professionals</strong></p><p>This course bridges the gap between basic software knowledge and professional architectural practice. Whether you're transitioning into architecture, starting independent practice, or improving efficiency within existing workflows, this training provides immediately applicable skills.</p><p><strong>Career Development Focus</strong> Every technique taught serves professional architectural practice directly. You'll understand not just how to use tools, but when and why to apply specific techniques in professional contexts, building judgment that distinguishes experienced practitioners from software beginners.</p><p><strong>Cost-Effective Professional Solution</strong></p><p>SketchUp Pro with V-Ray and LayOut provides exceptional value compared to traditional architectural software suites. This course shows you how to achieve professional results while maintaining budget flexibility - crucial for independent practitioners and small firms.</p><p><strong>Future-Proof Architectural Skills</strong></p><p>The software combination taught in this course represents a strategic investment in your architectural career. SketchUp's intuitive interface, V-Ray's industry-leading rendering quality, and LayOut's automated documentation capabilities create a workflow that adapts to evolving project demands.</p><p><strong>Scalable Professional Growth</strong> Skills developed in this course scale from residential projects to complex commercial work. The fundamental principles of efficient modeling, professional rendering, and automated documentation remain constant across project types and sizes.</p><p><strong>Industry Recognition</strong> V-Ray remains the preferred rendering solution across architectural visualization, while SketchUp's ease of use and LayOut's integration create workflows that clients appreciate for their clarity and professional presentation quality.</p><p><strong>Start building your complete architectural skillset today</strong> and develop the integrated software mastery that enables you to take projects from initial concept through final documentation, positioning yourself as a complete architectural professional capable of delivering exceptional results efficiently and cost-effectively.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to <strong><em>The Moon’s Resting Place</em></strong>, a beautifully designed <strong>beginner-friendly Blender course</strong> where you will learn how to create a complete <strong>low poly 3D scene</strong> from scratch. If you’ve ever wanted to build magical 3D worlds but felt overwhelmed by long or complicated tutorials, this course gives you a <strong>simple, relaxing, and enjoyable</strong> way to get started.</p><p>In this project-based journey, you’ll design a <strong>dreamy floating island</strong>, complete with soft lighting, pastel colors, and a glowing moon gently resting above the landscape. You will learn essential skills such as <strong>low poly modeling, scene composition, adding stylized materials, and setting up atmospheric lighting</strong> that gives your scene a cinematic look.</p><p>We then move into animation — you’ll create a smooth <strong>camera orbit animation</strong> and subtle motion for the moon, bringing your world to life with gentle movement. Finally, you’ll learn how to <strong>render your scene in Cycles</strong> and add artistic finishing touches like <strong>bloom, fog glow, and color grading</strong> in the compositor.</p><p>Each lesson is <strong>short, clear, and beginner-focused</strong>, making the learning process easy and enjoyable. By the end of the course, you will have a <strong>complete animated 3D artwork</strong> ready to share on social media, add to your portfolio, or use as a starting point for more advanced Blender projects.</p><p>If you want to learn Blender in a <strong>fun, fast, and visually inspiring</strong> way, this course is the perfect place to begin.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Lighting is more than just illumination — it’s the invisible architecture that defines how we experience and emotionally connect with space. This course, <em>Fundamentals of Lighting for Architects, Interior Designers and Lighting Designers</em>, is crafted for budding lighting designers, architects, and interior designers who wish to explore the art and science behind impactful lighting.</p><p>Through this program, students will gain a deep understanding of <strong>LED fundamentals</strong>, learning how light is generated, controlled, and optimized for different applications. They’ll discover how to select the right <strong>fixtures, optics, and color temperatures</strong> to suit both aesthetic and functional needs. From <strong>wall washing and grazing</strong> to <strong>facade and landscape lighting</strong>, each technique will be explored to reveal how lighting can shape perception, mood, and texture.</p><p>The course also delves into essential concepts like <strong>UGR (Unified Glare Rating)</strong>, <strong>CRI</strong>, and <strong>Circadian Rhythm</strong>, connecting lighting performance to human comfort and overall well-being. Practical sessions on <strong>lighting layers</strong>—ambient, task, accent, and decorative—will empower learners to design compositions that feel cohesive, functional, and emotionally resonant.</p><p>By the end, participants will be equipped with the technical knowledge, creative insight, design sensitivity, and artistic confidence to transform ordinary spaces into extraordinary experiences—where every beam of light tells a story, and every space glows with purpose, harmony, and elegance.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Rhino 3d basic design course includes vary basic and useful 2d and 3d tools / commands in very detailed way, this will very helpful to create your ideas in to 2D design for dimensioning and 3D design to show in conceptual way. 2d shapes are useful for creating 3d models, so clarity and knowledge of 2D tools in details, saves your time to create 2d shapes and similar way 3d modeling tools are very helpful creating 3d models. I have practice multiple 3d designing software and find rhino software have too many tools are available both in 2d modeling and 3d modeling in very unique way and also have too many variant options. The one who is learning through tutorials, must keep open rhino software alongside and so the same practice, which are shown in tutorial. There are many plugins available for rhino software in multiple field which you can find on food for rhino site. So to use them, one should also require very basic knowledge of rhino software. I will also release intermediate and other courses after this course, that will make your task easy for making complex design shapes and using less clicks and in less time, one can able to create design.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Tired of stylized environments that stall out before the finish line?</strong> This workshop gives you a complete Blender 4 pipeline for a <strong>Greek Temple and Garden</strong> scene—modular architecture, trimsheet-driven detail, <strong>Geometry Nodes foliage</strong>, cinematic lighting, and a compositor finish that locks the mood. If you love painterly worlds but dislike messy workflows, this is your new go-to process.</p><p><strong>Hi, I am Rosefield from 3D Tudor.</strong> Together with Lukas, we designed this class so you can work like an environment artist from day one. The same workflow scales from a single courtyard to full plazas and ruins. It is fast to iterate, easy to present, and satisfying to ship.</p><p><strong>Expect a few “oh, that is why mine looked off” moments. Little fixes to scale, spacing, and value contrast do more than exotic tricks ever will.</strong></p><p>What you will learn - Top 6 points about the Course</p><p>● <strong>Build a complete stylized environment from scratch: go from blockout to final render with confidence.</strong></p><p>● <strong>Modular architecture, faster iteration: columns, trims, doors, arches, planters, and low walls that unwrap and re-use cleanly.</strong></p><p>● <strong>UVs, trimsheets, and decals: keep texel density consistent while repeating motifs efficiently.</strong></p><p>● <strong>Geometry Nodes foliage: controllable grass carpets, ivy arches with grapes, and bush variations—plus cypress and oak forms for silhouette.</strong></p><p>● <strong>Lighting, cameras, and compositing: direct the eye with warm keys, grounded contact shadows, and a reusable node stack for a unified look.</strong></p><p>● <strong>Presentation that pops: craft hero and alternate shots that read well at thumbnail and hold up in close-ups.</strong></p><p>Think of this workshop as gym for your environment brain. We stretch composition, breathe through problem spots, and finish with a clean render that does not wheeze. You leave with confidence, not chaos.</p><p>What you get (Resources)</p><p>A focused toolkit: <strong>8 materials</strong>, <strong>2 trimsheets</strong> with patterns and <strong>12 Greek decals</strong>, a <strong>hero stone engraving</strong>, GN setups for <strong>grass, ivy, bushes</strong>, a <strong>rose-bush mesh</strong>, <strong>three cypress trees</strong>, an <strong>oak generator</strong>, a <strong>human-scale model</strong>, a <strong>final turntable</strong>, and the <strong>exact compositor settings</strong> used in the course.</p><p>If you waste time hunting assets, this pack puts everything at your fingertips.</p><p>Project-based learning</p><p>You will advance one temple courtyard from first blockout to polished stills. Every tool you touch serves composition, clarity, and speed—no wasted steps.</p><p>Once you grasp the recipe here, you can reskin it for other worlds—Roman baths, temple ruins at dawn, a moody shrine in the woods. Same bones, fresh mood. Bring your curiosity. I will bring the shortcuts that actually matter and the gentle sarcasm for the ones that do not.</p><p><strong>You will pick up a taste for restraint. A couple of well-placed forms and a clear lighting cue beat a screen full of noise every time.</strong></p><p><strong>Condensed Course Map</strong></p><p><strong>Lessons 1–3: Kickoff &amp; Blockout</strong></p><p><strong>Lessons 4–7: Modular Architecture Kit</strong></p><p><strong>Lessons 8–11: UVs, Trimsheets &amp; Decals</strong></p><p><strong>Lessons 12–14: Materials &amp; Look Cohesion</strong></p><p><strong>Lessons 15–18: Foliage with Geometry Nodes</strong></p><p><strong>Lessons 19–21: Trees &amp; Silhouette Design</strong></p><p><strong>Lessons 22–25: Lighting &amp; Cameras</strong></p><p><strong>Lessons 26–28: Compositing &amp; Export</strong></p><p><strong>Lessons 29–31: Presentation &amp; Turntable</strong></p><p><strong>Lessons 32–34: Wrap-Up, Reuse &amp; Next Steps</strong></p><p>You will feel the pace: quick enough to stay excited, calm enough to keep things neat. No mystery settings, no arcane rituals—just sensible steps that add up.</p><p>Who this course is for</p><p>● <strong>Beginners levelling up:</strong> You want a clear route to your first complete environment.</p><p>● <strong>Environment art nerds:</strong> You enjoy Geometry Nodes, trimsheets, and lighting craft.</p><p>● <strong>Indie devs and asset tinkerers:</strong> You want modular kits that build quickly and present cleanly.</p><p>Why this course stands out</p><p>● <strong>Production-ready, not theory-heavy:</strong> practical decisions, sensible defaults, repeatable results.</p><p>● <strong>Friction-free start:</strong> the resource pack removes setup pain so you can focus on the art.</p><p>● <strong>Cinematic finish baked in:</strong> camera craft and compositing are part of the main dish.</p><p><strong>‘Stylized Blender 3D Environment Greek Temple &amp; Garden Workshop’</strong> is for artists who “nearly finish” a lot of scenes. We swap half-done files for a tidy, repeatable path that gets you to a final image without heroic all-nighters.</p><p>If you are ready to build stylized worlds with confidence, jump in. I will see you in the first lesson.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Until next time, happy modelling everyone!<br>Rosefield - 3D Tudor</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>Designing original characters can feel overwhelming — especially when you don’t know where to start. This course introduces a simple, <strong>step-by-step method</strong> that helps you design unique cartoon characters even if you’re a complete beginner. Using only <strong>Inkscape</strong>, a keyboard, and a mouse, you’ll learn how to transform real-life images into expressive, stylized characters through an easy, structured process.</p><p><br></p><p>The core idea behind this method is simple: every drawing begins with something real. You’ll start by tracing over a real-life picture to capture its essential shapes, then adjust proportions to create a cartoon version. From there, you’ll use Inkscape’s powerful tools to generate countless variations, each with a different personality and style. This approach removes the guesswork and creative block that often come with character design, making it both fun and approachable.</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout the course, you’ll not only learn the method but also how to draw directly inside Inkscape — from basic setup and sketching to refining lines, adding light and shadow, and finishing your design.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end, you’ll have a complete, repeatable process for turning any picture into an original character, plus the confidence and skills to keep designing on your own. .</p><p><br></p><p>If you’re ready, let’s dive in and start making characters together.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>This course is made for beginners who want to learn WaterGEMS from the very basics. You don’t need any previous experience with the software. If you know simple concepts of water flow, pressure, pipes and pumps, you are ready to start. We begin with the WaterGEMS interface and basic project settings. Then we create a simple water distribution model from scratch. After that, you will learn how to run Extended Period Simulation (EPS) to see how the system works over time. The course also covers Fire Flow Analysis to check if the network can supply enough water during fire conditions. You will learn both the theory and the actual step-by-step process inside WaterGEMS. Next, we move to Darwin Designer. This tool helps you optimize pipe sizes and find cost-effective solutions. First, the theory is explained and then the real demonstration is shown. You will also learn how to import data from external sources (like CAD or GIS), how to create reports and graphs, and how to calculate water age in the network. By the end of the course, you will be able to build, analyze and improve a complete water distribution model using WaterGEMS. So get ready to dive into the world of Water Distribution networks.</p>",

  "description": "<ul><li><p>This course on <strong>Mechanical Routing</strong> delves into the fundamental principles and advanced techniques for the effective design and layout of mechanical systems, with a particular focus on <strong>piping, tubing, ductwork, and cable trays</strong> within complex industrial, commercial, and engineering environments. Students will gain a deep understanding of the regulatory codes and industry standards, such as ASME and relevant regional specifications, that govern fluid transport and containment systems. The curriculum introduces various routing methodologies, emphasizing the critical balance between minimizing material costs, optimizing installation time, ensuring maintainability, and adhering to strict operational and safety requirements. Key topics include <strong>isometric drawing interpretation and generation</strong>, understanding and selecting appropriate <strong>fittings, valves, pumps, and other in-line components</strong>, and mastering the use of <strong>3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software</strong> (like AutoCAD Plant 3D or similar) for creating precise and clash-free layouts.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>Furthermore, the course explores advanced concepts like <strong>stress analysis in piping systems</strong>, considering thermal expansion, pressure loads, and static weights, and the proper application of <strong>pipe supports and restraints</strong>. A significant portion of the instruction focuses on practical constraints, such as <strong>equipment nozzle orientation</strong>, maintaining adequate <strong>access for inspection and repair</strong>, and ensuring compliance with <strong>Hazardous Area Classification</strong> guidelines. Students will learn how to design layouts that account for different fluid properties (e.g., high-pressure steam, corrosive chemicals) and their associated temperature ranges. The module also covers the integration of mechanical routing with other disciplines, specifically <strong>structural and electrical engineering</strong>, to resolve spatial conflicts, a process often referred to as <strong>clash detection</strong>. The final projects typically involve a comprehensive design exercise, requiring students to apply all learned principles to a realistic plant or facility model, culminating in a full set of fabrication and installation drawings. This ensures graduates are well-prepared for roles in plant design, construction, and operations engineering.</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>This course contains the use of artificial intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>Are you tired of rewriting prompts that never quite hit the mark? You’re not alone—and it’s not your fault. The problem isn’t the AI. It’s the lack of context.</p><p><strong>AI Context Engineering</strong> is a complete framework for turning chaotic, hit-or-miss prompting into a structured, repeatable system. You’ll learn how to communicate with AI the way professionals brief designers, writers, and teams—through clarity, purpose, and structure.</p><p>Across eight in-depth lessons, you’ll discover why context—not longer prompts—is the key to consistent results. You’ll master the <strong>five-element framework</strong>: Role, Task, Constraints, Anchors, and Exclusions. You’ll also learn how to debug AI outputs using a <strong>five-lens process</strong> to improve accuracy, tone, and structure. Then, you’ll explore how to apply context across text, image, and video to build cohesive, cross-modal workflows that scale.</p><p>By the end of the course, you’ll design <strong>reusable templates, playbooks, and tone libraries</strong> that can be adapted across teams or projects. You’ll also build your own <strong>personalized context playbook</strong>—a ready-to-use toolkit that transforms theory into practice.</p><p>Whether you’re a designer, marketer, educator, strategist, or AI enthusiast, this course gives you the clarity and control to turn AI from a guessing machine into a reliable creative partner. No coding required—just curiosity and creativity.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

The city in the film is mostly CG.</p><p>Although I could have imported ready-made buildings there because I am the creator of \"Editing building asset pack\" and have created many of them in the past, I decided from the beginning to create an asset package just for this tutorial and scene to <strong>record the whole process and learn as much as possible</strong>.</p><p>This time, the asset package was powered with the <strong>Geometry nodes modifier</strong>, and the result is a <strong>fully procedural city</strong> that we manage with a few sliders.</p><p>This part of the tutorial is ideal if you want to go deeper into <strong>Geometry nodes</strong>, <strong>modeling</strong>, and <strong>texturing</strong>.</p><p><strong>SIMPLE CITY GENERATOR (INCLUDED)</strong></p><p>City Generator is a simple but functional Geo Neode setup that is designed for quickly creating a city in the background.</p><p>With just 11 sliders, you can control and change the look of the entire city - from the density of small buildings, large buildings, seeds, and rotation seeds to the lighting inside the buildings and even the lighting of the entire city.<br></p>",

You’ll be surprised how freeing it feels once you start!</p><p>You can follow along with <strong>markers and pen on pape</strong>r, or on your iPad <strong>in Procreate</strong>, using the resources I’ve created for you.</p><p>And here’s the best part: in this class, you have full permission to make mistakes and to welcome the happy accidents – because <strong>being imperfect is perfect</strong>.</p><p>So, are you ready?

You’ll be guided step-by-step through the process of transforming any image or concept into a stencil-ready design. Learn how to <strong>simplify visual elements</strong>, understand <strong>positive and negative space</strong>, and confidently <strong>cut your design</strong> using just a few simple tools.</p><p>Unlike store-bought stencils, handmade ones reflect <strong>your own artistic identity</strong>. They allow you to create bold, personal patterns and repeatable motifs that can be used across a wide range of media:- <strong>painting, printmaking, mixed media, journaling, wall art, or textile design</strong>.</p><p>Best of all? You don’t need fancy tools or professional skills. The beauty of this practice lies in its simplicity. Choose a material that’s easy to cut but sturdy enough to reuse, such as paper, acetate, tracing sheets, or recycled plastic folders. Add <strong>a pencil, pen, eraser, cutting board, and a stencil knife</strong> as no fancy materials or professional setup is required. If you can trace, you can stencil! You’ll be ready to make art that’s bold, repeatable, and truly your own.</p><p>Say goodbye to store-bought designs and hello to the freedom of <strong>handcrafted expression</strong>. Whether you're working on a canvas, a journal, a wall, or fabric, your stencil becomes a <strong>tool for design, storytelling, and experimentation</strong>.</p><p>By the end of this course, you’ll not only have created a set of your own stencils, but you’ll also have discovered a powerful, repeatable tool to <strong>enrich your creative process</strong> and <strong>amplify your unique voice</strong>.</p><p>Let’s move beyond templates and into a space where <strong>your imagination leads</strong>—one cut at a time.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Have you ever wondered what separates a good website from a truly great one? The secret often lies beyond the code and resides in the deliberate application of <strong>visual design aesthetics</strong>. This comprehensive course is built to demystify the art and science behind creating beautiful, intuitive, and effective web interfaces. We will guide you on a journey from the foundational building blocks of design to the psychological principles that make a user's experience feel effortless and engaging. Whether you are a developer looking to sharpen your design eye, a new designer starting your career, or a marketer wanting to create more impactful digital assets, this course will equip you with the essential knowledge you need.</p><p>We begin by establishing a strong foundation in the core <strong>elements of design</strong>. You'll learn how to use color to communicate identity, play with value and texture to create visual interest and emphasis, and leverage shapes, forms, and lines to build organized and unified layouts. We will also dive deep into typography, ensuring you can communicate your message with clarity and purpose. Once you have mastered the \"what,\" we will explore the \"how\" by mastering the <strong>principles of design</strong>. You will learn to establish a clear visual hierarchy with contrast, achieve harmony with balance and proportion, and create a seamless flow with unity and rhythm. We explore how microinteractions can add life to your designs and how simplicity can dramatically enhance usability.</p><p>Finally, to tie it all together, we unlock the power of human perception by exploring the fundamentals of <strong>Gestalt theory</strong>. You'll understand why users group similar elements, follow lines and curves with their eyes, and mentally fill in the gaps with closure. This knowledge will empower you to design more intuitive forms, improve readability with figure-ground relationships, and build perfectly balanced layouts that feel natural to the user. By the end of this course, you will be able to create websites that are not only visually stunning but are also strategically designed to guide, engage, and delight your audience.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Fusion 360 Pro: Design Smarter &amp; Faster – Assembly and Animation</strong> is a specialized course designed to help learners move beyond basic modeling and truly master the power of assemblies and animations in Fusion 360. Assemblies are at the core of any product design process, and this course provides you with the knowledge and skills needed to confidently create, manage, and troubleshoot them. You will learn how to properly apply joints and constraints, simulate motion between components, and ensure your designs replicate real-world functionality with accuracy and precision.</p><p>The course also focuses on best practices for handling complex projects, such as organizing multi-part designs, streamlining workflows, and reducing errors during the assembly process. By learning to structure and manage assemblies efficiently, you will save time and avoid common mistakes that slow down professional design work.</p><p>In addition to assemblies, you will gain hands-on experience with Fusion 360’s powerful animation tools. From simple exploded views to advanced motion sequences, you will discover how to create animations that effectively showcase your designs. These animations are not only visually impressive but also essential for communicating design intent to clients, teams, or stakeholders in a clear and professional way.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will have the confidence to design, assemble, and animate products seamlessly in Fusion 360. Whether you are a student, hobbyist, or professional, this course will equip you with the skills to design smarter, work faster, and present your ideas more effectively.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Nomad Sculpt is an incredible 3D sculpting application for iPad and Android tablets. If you're thinking about getting into 3D, there is no better time to get started than right now. In this beginner course we'll create a basic character to get you comfortable with 3D sculpting in Nomad. </p><p>Here is some of what we'll cover in class:</p><ul><li><p>Basic character blocking and using primitives (basic shapes to create various parts of the sculpts)</p></li><li><p>Essential tools needed for basic sculpting and manipulating 3D meshes (3D meshes are just shapes or objects!)</p></li><li><p>Voxel remeshing, smoothing, and masking.</p></li><li><p>Lighting and coloring hour sculpt</p></li><li><p>Exporting a final render, and also exporting a turntable</p></li></ul><p>3D has come a long way since a stand-alone desktop computer was the only way to create 3D art. While you can export your files to Blender or other 3D software, it's actually fun designing on an iPad or tablet with Nomad. The application does have more complicated and advanced functions, but those you will learn in time. The basics are fairly easy to learn, which makes the whole process a whole lot easier.</p><p>Not only can you recreate your 2D characters in 3D, but you can also export your sculpts as STL files for 3D printing.&nbsp; This is an easy going beginners class, so no pressure, or stress - just learning and creating fun 3D art. I&nbsp;look forward to seeing you in class!&nbsp;</p>",

These tasks are often supplemented by software in digital animation, meaning you might not experience every step of the proses.</p><p>How to layer paper, which parts to trace, and which parts require you to think and draw yourself—</p><p>there are many important elements hidden within the omitted steps that highlight the significance of \"in-betweening\".<br> The NAKAWARI course covers all the necessary information for understanding animation without skipping any steps.</p><p><strong>● Drawing Skills That Can Only Be Acquired through Analog Techniques</strong></p><p>In the NAKAWARI course, you will learn techniques like drawing even, consistent lines while considering the wear of the pencil tip.<br> For animators, it is crucial to <strong>draw lines beautifully and confidently</strong>.<br> In an environment where you can't use \"⌘Z\" (undo), the skill to focus and draw each line with precision is very important for animators.<br> By mastering delicate tasks with your hands and fingers, you can clearly differentiate your drawing abilities and animation skills.<br> This course will teach you the professional skill of drawing lines that you can't acquire through digital drawing.</p><p><strong>Whether It's Analog or Digital, 2D or 3DCG, the Basics Are the Same</strong></p><p>Start by drawing on paper, and through that process, let's enhance both your drawing ability and animation skills.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>＜Point2＞Let’s Learn About the Style of the Japanese Animation Industry!</strong></p><p>This course is taught by KazushigeYusa who is a veteran animator from Japan.<br> It follows the style of Japanese animation production, making it ideal for those who want to learn about the current state of the Japanese animation industry and how animation is created in Japan.</p><p>Of course, the content of this course is also applicable to various animation production environments, including overseas productions, digital drawing, and 3D CG.</p><p>By the time you finish this course (from beginner to advanced levels), you will have acquired the skills necessary to step into the world of professional animation.<br> This course is highly recommended for those aiming to work in the Japanese animation industry or pursue a career in animation business.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>＜Course instructor＞</strong></p><p><strong> Kazushige Yusa </strong>Animator/Animation Director/Technical Director</p><p>In 1978, He joined Tatsunoko Production (Currently Tatsunoko Pro).</p><p>Currently he works freelance on productions for television programs, TV commercials, and short works.</p><p>He is also very invested in training new animator talent as a university professor and vocational school instructor.</p><p>While working professionally he has participated in educational exchanges with: The United States, France, Canada, and Singapore.

  "description": "<p>What <strong>other possibilities</strong> does ArchiCAD offer? How can you push your <strong>BIM</strong> model to its <strong>limits</strong> for <strong>representation and graphic expression</strong>? How can you produce <strong>hand-drawn, basic, daytime, nighttime, or hybrid-style graphics</strong>? How can you create renderings such as <strong>plan views, isometric cutouts, scale models, analytical models, or exploded representations</strong>? How can you use <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> to apply <strong>post-production</strong> to your renders? How can you use <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) </strong>to generate <strong>design proposals from primitive geometries</strong>? These—and many more—are some of the questions I will answer for you in this <strong>intermediate level </strong>guide on <strong>ArchiCAD.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Building Information Modeling (BIM)</strong> stands out as a methodology that revolutionizes the architecture, engineering, construction and operation (AECO) sector, and ArchiCAD -a solution developed by Graphisoft since 1982- is one of the various tools that enables this way of working, by <strong>centralizing information in a BIM database</strong> ArchiCAD allows for greater project quality and productivity in less time compared to the 2D CAD workflow.</p><p><br></p><p>Welcome!

  "description": "<p><strong>Character Art School: Complete Character Design</strong></p><p>Master the Art of Character Drawing and Design with Professional Composition Techniques</p><p>Do you want to take your character drawing from average to extraordinary? Whether you’re a complete beginner or a professional artist looking to refine your skills, <strong>Character Art School: Complete Character Design</strong> is the ultimate course for mastering the principles of highly engaging character art. This course teaches you not just how to draw characters better, but how to design them with visual purpose, clarity, and the kind of powerful compositional theory that makes your artwork unforgettable.</p><p><strong>Why This Course is Different</strong></p><p>Most character drawing courses focus on surface-level tips—drawing anatomy, learning proportions, or replicating references. While those are important, they often leave artists stuck in mediocrity. What truly separates <strong>great character artists from average ones</strong> is their grasp of <strong>composition</strong>—the hidden structure behind compelling drawings and illustrations.</p><p>In <strong>Character Art School: Complete Character Design</strong>, you’ll learn how to build character compositions and design from the ground, up using easy to learn high-level compositional theory. This isn’t about copying or rote learning; it’s about <strong>understanding the structure of art</strong> itself and applying it to your character designs, so that they stand out with clarity, style, and impact.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Learn Inside the Course</strong></p><p>This course takes you step by step through the <strong>complete process of character compositional design</strong>, giving you tools you can use immediately in your own art. Topics include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The Advanced Structure of Art</strong> – Learn the advanced frameworks that underpin all great character designs, giving your drawings stronger balance, flow, and appeal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Image Sourcing &amp; Inspiration</strong> – Discover how to effectively gather, analyze, and use references to fuel your creativity instead of limiting it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Granular Line Composition</strong> – Master the subtle art of line modulation, rhythm, and flow to create character illustrations with a magical energy and personality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shape Composition &amp; Proportions</strong> – Understand how shapes define the foundation of your characters, and how proportion choices change the mood, style, and readability of your designs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Layering Techniques &amp; Compositional Tools</strong> – Apply advanced methods to build complexity into your drawings while keeping them clean and cohesive. Learn the foundational compositional techniques that truly enable breathtaking and highly engaging character art.</p></li></ul><p>By the end of the course, you’ll have a <strong>professional toolkit</strong> for designing characters that not only look great, but also <strong>communicate ideas, emotions, and stories</strong> extremely effectively.</p><p><strong>Who Is This Course For?</strong></p><p>This course was designed with <strong>artists of all levels in mind</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Beginners</strong>: If you’re new to drawing, you’ll find the structured, step-by-step lessons approachable and easy to follow, giving you a rock-solid foundation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intermediate Artists</strong>: If you’ve been drawing for a while but feel your characters lack polish or power, this course will show you exactly what’s missing and how to fix it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Professionals</strong>: Even working illustrators and concept artists can refine their craft by mastering compositional tools that most self-taught artists overlook.</p></li></ul><p>No matter where you’re starting, this course will meet you where you are and <strong>push your skills to the next level</strong>.</p><p><strong>Why Composition Matters in Character Design</strong></p><p>Great character drawing is not just about technical skill—it’s about making the viewer <em>feel something</em>. Composition is the <strong>invisible force</strong> that guides the eye, creates emotion, and ensures your character designs leave a lasting impression.</p><p>Without understanding composition, even technically solid drawings can look flat or uninspired. With it, however, your characters will have presence, clarity, and depth. This course gives you the <strong>same design principles used by top illustrators, animators, and game artists</strong> around the world, so you can bring your own characters to life in a way that captures attention and tells a story.</p><p><strong>How This Course Will Transform Your Art</strong></p><p>By enrolling in <strong>Character Art School: Complete Character Design</strong>, you’ll:</p><ul><li><p>Learn how to design characters that look <strong>professional, highly engaging and market-ready</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Develop a deep understanding of advanced <strong>art structure</strong> so your drawings always feel balanced and powerful.</p></li><li><p>Gain confidence in using references and inspirations without becoming trapped by them.</p></li><li><p>Create characters with <strong>dynamic shapes, proportions, and linework</strong> that communicate style and personality effortlessly.</p></li><li><p>Break out of artistic plateaus and finally see measurable improvement in your drawing ability.</p></li></ul><p>Many artists who complete this course describe it as a <strong>radical turning point</strong> in their artistic journey.

  "description": "<p>This course is designed to help you get started with animation in Blender through easy and practical projects. You will begin with the basics of keyframing and learn how to use the timeline, dope sheet, and animation view. A simple collision exercise will make it easier to understand how keyframes work and how objects move smoothly over time.<br>This course is must for anyone interested in building a strong foundation before learning the 12 Principles of Animation.</p><p>Next, you will explore the Graph Editor and create the classic bouncing ball animation. In this project, you will practice important animation principles such as squash and stretch. You will also learn how to make your animation smoother with easing, null objects, modifiers, and drivers. These tools will help you build stronger control over your animations and make them look more natural and polished.</p><p>After that, you will move into procedural animation by creating a turret system. In this exercise, you will see how objects can move without using keyframes. You will also add simple rigging, animation modifiers, and a basic particle system to bring more variety, creativity, and realism.</p><p>Finally, you will combine all the skills you learned in a cinematic project. By building a jet sequence, you will practice creating animations that feel dynamic, exciting, and professional. <br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong><em>Animated Explainer Videos by PowToon, Animaker, Vyond and AI</em></strong></p><p>This course contains the use of artificial intelligence.</p><p>In a world where attention spans are shrinking and digital communication dominates every platform, the ability to create short, visually engaging, and emotionally impactful explainer videos is no longer a luxury — it’s a necessity.</p><p>Whether you’re an educator seeking to simplify complex lessons, a marketer trying to showcase a product, a business owner building a brand, or a creative professional eager to expand your toolkit, this course is your launchpad into the dynamic world of animated storytelling powered by AI and the three most user-friendly animation platforms: PowToon, Animaker, and Vyond.</p><p>But what truly sets this course apart is not just the software we teach — it’s how we teach it, and what it empowers you to become.</p><p><strong>Why This Course Exists</strong></p><p>Most people are overwhelmed by the idea of video creation. They believe it’s expensive, time-consuming, or requires years of design experience. Others have tried free tools but were left frustrated by limitations, confused interfaces, or generic results that don’t truly reflect their message.</p><p>This course was born from those frustrations — and carefully designed to solve them.</p><p>We offer a structured, clear, and professional approach to animation creation using tools that are both powerful and approachable. Combined with today’s most advanced AI platforms, you will learn how to ideate, script, design, animate, narrate, and publish videos that speak with clarity and creativity.</p><p>Our approach doesn’t teach you how to press buttons. It teaches you how to think visually, how to tell stories that matter, and how to use automation smartly — saving time without sacrificing quality.</p><p><strong>What Will You Learn?</strong></p><p>You’ll begin by understanding the anatomy of an effective explainer video — the emotional arc, visual pacing, and clarity of structure. Then you’ll move into hands-on training with each platform:</p><ul><li><p>PowToon: Ideal for educational and business-friendly explainers; we’ll explore smart templates, AI-generated scenes, and customizable timelines.</p></li><li><p>Animaker: A powerful browser-based tool for detailed scene design and lip-sync animation; you’ll learn how to craft characters and add energy with SmartMove.</p></li><li><p>Vyond: A professional-grade platform used by corporations and educators worldwide; you’ll create multi-scene stories with character movement, camera panning, and dynamic transitions.</p></li></ul><p><strong>You’ll also dive into modern AI tools such as:</strong></p><ul><li><p>ChatGPT for generating clear, structured scripts</p></li><li><p>Runway and Pika for converting prompts into animated elements</p></li><li><p>Leonardo and Hedra for designing visual assets</p></li><li><p>Veo 3 for turning text into video in seconds</p></li></ul><p>And finally, you’ll compare the three platforms side-by-side to understand where each excels — so you can choose the best tool for each future project.</p><p><strong>Course Tools and Workflow</strong></p><p>Many learners hesitate to start video creation because of assumptions: “It’s too expensive,” “I need a team,” or “I don’t have the software.” We remove all those barriers.</p><p>All the tools used in this course are accessible via the cloud, and most offer free versions or generous trials. You can complete every project in this course using only your laptop and a web browser — no complex installations, no prior experience.</p><p>Even more, we show you how to combine tools:</p><ul><li><p>Use ChatGPT to write your video script</p></li><li><p>Paste that script into PowToon or Vyond</p></li><li><p>Use AI voice generators for narration</p></li><li><p>Add subtitles and sync with lip movement</p></li><li><p>Animate transitions, characters, and props</p></li><li><p>Export to video or presentation format for use in classrooms, meetings, social media, or training platforms</p></li></ul><p>Each workflow is built to be efficient, repeatable, and professional — enabling you to produce real, publishable content even before you finish the course.</p><p><strong>What Can You Do After This Course?</strong></p><p>By the time you finish, you will have produced several complete videos — real content, not practice files. You’ll have the ability to:</p><ul><li><p>Teach with clarity and visual engagement</p></li><li><p>Promote a service or product visually</p></li><li><p>Explain complex topics using characters and motion</p></li><li><p>Train teams with internal video modules</p></li><li><p>Pitch ideas and captivate investors or clients</p></li><li><p>Grow your YouTube channel, website, or online presence</p></li></ul><p>This is not a “watch and forget” course. It’s a practical, project-driven journey that leaves you with skills that last and content you can use immediately.</p><p><strong>Who Is This Course For?</strong></p><p>This course welcomes learners from all industries and backgrounds, including:</p><ul><li><p>Teachers who want to upgrade their lesson plans with visual storytelling</p></li><li><p>Small business owners and marketers creating explainer ads or product walkthroughs</p></li><li><p>Content creators producing tutorials or video essays</p></li><li><p>Corporate trainers building onboarding and eLearning content</p></li><li><p>Students or job seekers who want to add animation to their skillset</p></li><li><p>Non-designers who want to animate ideas with minimal learning curve</p></li></ul><p>No design experience? No problem. We guide you from zero to hero with clear instructions and insider tips.</p><p><strong>What Makes This Course Unique?</strong></p><ol><li><p><em>Covers Three Platforms Side-by-Side</em><br>Instead of choosing only one animation tool, we walk you through PowToon, Animaker, and Vyond. You’ll understand the strengths of each and how to pick the right one for your project — whether it’s speed, precision, or style you need.</p></li><li><p><em>Built Around Real Projects</em><br>Each module ends with a video you’ll build from scratch. By the end of the course, you’ll have a portfolio of projects — ready to share with clients, students, or employers.</p></li><li><p><em>Smart Use of AI</em><br>We don’t just mention AI.

  "description": "<p><strong>Nomad Sculpt: Solid Foundations</strong> — the friendliest way to go from “totally bewildered” to “I can actually sculpt this.”</p><p>If 3D sculpting has ever made you feel lost, intimidated, or one crash away from giving up, you’re in the right place. This beginner-first course is designed to remove the panic, clear the jargon, and give you a calm, repeatable workflow you can trust. No gatekeeping. No “you should already know this.” Just you, and a clear path from blob to believable forms.</p><p>I’m an experienced video instructor with 35+ years as an illustrator/designer. I already have top-rated <strong>Procreate</strong> courses on the iPad, and I’ve taught thousands of creatives who swore they “weren’t 3D people.” Spoiler: they were. If you’ve ever enjoyed painting or sketching in Procreate, you already have the instincts for Nomad Sculpt- and that’s what this course is: a gentle, structured start that builds genuine confidence.</p><p>What makes this course different?</p><ul><li><p><strong>Workflow based, not just explaining tools.</strong> You won’t be dumped into a sea of buttons. We’ll establish simple, dependable workflows&nbsp; that you can use for everything you make.</p></li><li><p><strong>Learn by building, not just watching.</strong> Instead of tool lectures, you’ll create beginner friendly models step-by-step that turn concepts into muscle memory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Beginner-safe pacing.</strong> We start with the four tools you’ll use most (Clay, Move, Flatten, Crease), plus Smooth, symmetry basics, and navigation. As your confidence grows, we layer in more Nomad tools—<strong>always in service of the workflow</strong>, never as random features.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Mindset that actually helps.</strong> You’ll have permission to make a mess, restart without fear, and learn in small, satisfying chunks.</p></li></ul><p>By the end, you’ll be able to:</p><ul><li><p>Navigate Nomad comfortably and set up a distraction-free interface</p></li><li><p>Block out strong shapes, refine clean planes, and add crisp stylized accents</p></li><li><p>Understand what’s under the hood—vertices, edges, and quads—so tools finally “click”</p></li><li><p>Use symmetry wisely (and break it when your model needs life)</p></li><li><p>Export cleanly and know your next steps toward printing, painting, or game-ready workflows</p></li></ul><p>This is <em>for absolute beginners</em> - artists who love creating in apps like Procreate but feel intimidated by 3D. If that’s you, you’ll feel seen, supported, and—most importantly—successful. We’ll keep projects fun and finishable so you stack wins quickly and build real momentum.</p><p>You’re not just buying videos; you’re getting a starter system you can reuse for heads, props, creatures—anything you imagine. Once the workflow is second nature, adding Nomad’s more advanced tools is simple (and surprisingly fun).</p><p>And because I want this to feel completely safe to try, your purchase is covered by a <strong>30-day money-back guarantee</strong>. If you don’t feel more capable and confident with Nomad after working through the lessons, you shouldn’t pay. Simple as that.</p><p>Ready to turn “that looks impossible!” into “that looks great! I did that...”?</p><p><br><strong>Enroll in <em>Nomad Sculpt: Solid Foundations</em> now</strong> and start sculpting, with a workflow you’ll use for years. I'll see you on the course!</p><p>Simon</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>This course contains the use of artificial intelligence.</strong></p><p>I have been working as a project manager in the field of electrical project design for many years. One of the most frequently asked questions I receive recently is how to design an electrical installation project with Revit. Since I noticed that there are not many proper resources on the internet regarding this subject, I decided to prepare this training set to inform my colleagues.</p><p>With the advancement of technology, Autodesk AutoCAD has started to become insufficient for project designs. Autodesk, realizing this need, introduced Revit as an alternative. Thanks to this software, it is possible to design all projects and disciplines in 3D. Although the demand for this program is increasing today, I observed that there are not enough training resources available.</p><p>You don’t need to be an engineer to participate in this training and learn the software. Having a basic knowledge of electrical terms will be sufficient. In this training, we will cover all stages of an electrical project designed with Revit, from the initial phase to final delivery. Once you successfully complete this training, you can confidently state in your job interviews or CV that you are capable of using Revit.</p><p>Before starting the training, you must have Autodesk Revit installed on your computer. All templates, families, and projects I use in the training will be shared with my students. I also pay attention to responding quickly to any questions that may arise during the training.</p><p><strong>CONTENT:</strong><br>1 - Introduction<br>2 - Architectural Drawing<br>3 - Creating a Template<br>4 - Importing an Architectural Project<br>5 - Working Collaboratively<br>6 - Editing Electrical Families<br>7 - Lighting, Socket, and Panel Layout<br>8 - Creating the Electrical System<br>9 - Creating Tags<br>10 - Schedules<br>11 - Fire Detection System Design<br>12 - Emergency Announcement System Design<br>13 - CCTV System Design<br>14 - Conduit Layout Design<br>15 - Cable Tray Installation Design<br>16 - Creating Legends<br>17 - Creating Layouts<br>18 - Creating a Single-Line Diagram<br>19 - Dynamo</p><p><br></p>",

Or perhaps, you want to stop wasting too much money on expensive software, web-app, or AI credits just to deliver nice-looking floor plans to your clients. Well, look no further. In this course, I will guide you through the complete process, from start to finish, to design and create floor plans using Blender.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>About the instructor</strong></p><p>My name is <strong>Widhi Muttaqien</strong>, founder of <strong>Expose Studio</strong>. For more than 20 years, I have been involved with hundreds of projects, including architecture, interior design, master plans, and so on. I have worked with many clients all over the world. Besides doing projects, I have also been teaching 3D and computer graphics academically since 2000. In short, I have both <strong>professional expertise</strong> and <strong>teaching experience</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why use Blender for creating floor plans?</strong></p><p>So, why do you want to use Blender to create floor plans? There are at least 6 reasons. First, Blender is <strong>free </strong>or more <strong>cost-efficient</strong>. With Blender, you can replace a lot of expensive tools, such as CAD software, image editing software, 3D modeling software, rendering plugins, and so on. I know that some web apps can help you create floor plans, and they offer free tiers or versions. But most likely, you will end up paying a lot of money, as the free tiers are so limited in features and or furniture library. You may rely on different AI tools to generate floor plans. But those also can cost you a lot of money, as you need to purchase credits to be able to use them.</p><p>Second, Blender is <strong>precise</strong>. Unlike many 2D vector graphic software that are not geared towards architectural drawings, Blender can handle measurement units precisely. The floor plans you created in Blender will not only be useful for conceptual drawings or for client presentations. These floor plans can be used later in the 3D design process as the basis to model the digital tween of the building or the project in general.</p><p>Third, <strong>rendering </strong>a floor plan in Blender is <strong>insanely fast</strong>. You can render a 4K resolution in just a fraction of a second. The fourth reason is that the workflow or the process of creating a floor plan is also very fast. Why? Well, this is because Blender has a feature called the “Asset Browser”. Essentially, it allows you to create a library of assets such as furniture blocks and materials. Once you have them set up, you can quickly drag and drop the assets into your scene. So, most of the time, when creating floor plans, what you need to create are only the walls and the floors.</p><p>The fifth reason is that you don’t even need to create all of your furniture blocks from scratch. You can download them from the web in <strong>DWG</strong>, <strong>DXF</strong>, or <strong>SVG</strong> formats. And the sixth reason, you can easily generate a <strong>nice-looking line effect</strong> that has a hand-drawing feel to it. Don’t worry, you do not need to draw these lines manually. These lines are actually grease pencil strokes with a \"line-art\" modifier. You can easily specify their thickness, colors, line styles, and so on, to match your own style.</p><p>So <strong>join now</strong> and make Blender your <strong>unfair advantage</strong> in the architecture or interior design fields! Have fun learning.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Master the fundamentals of 3D modeling and visualization with this comprehensive beginner-friendly Blender course. Whether you're completely new to 3D graphics or looking to transition from other software, this course provides everything you need to start creating professional-quality 3D content using Blender and its powerful Cycles rendering engine.</p><p><strong>Transform From Zero to 3D Creator</strong></p><p>This course takes you on a complete journey through Blender's ecosystem, starting with your very first launch and progressing to creating impressive visualizations. You'll develop not just technical skills, but also the proper workflow habits that will serve you throughout your 3D career. Every lesson is carefully structured to build upon previous knowledge, ensuring no student gets left behind.</p><p><strong>Master Blender's Interface and Navigation</strong></p><p>Begin by conquering Blender's interface, which might seem intimidating at first glance but becomes intuitive with proper guidance. Learn efficient navigation techniques and essential shortcuts that professional 3D artists use daily. Discover how to customize your workspace for maximum productivity and establish a foundation for smooth, effective work patterns.</p><p><strong>3D Modeling Fundamentals</strong></p><p>Develop solid modeling skills by creating simple objects and gradually progressing to more complex forms. Understand the principles of polygon modeling, learn to manipulate geometry with precision, and explore various modeling techniques that form the backbone of all 3D creation. You'll work with both newly created objects and imported models, gaining versatility in your approach.</p><p><strong>Professional Object Modification Techniques</strong></p><p>Explore Blender's powerful modification system, including both manual editing techniques and the comprehensive modifier stack. Learn how modifiers can dramatically speed up your workflow while maintaining flexibility for future changes. These tools are essential for efficient 3D production and will become invaluable as you tackle more complex projects.</p><p><strong>Seamless Asset Integration</strong></p><p>Master the art of importing external 3D models into your Blender projects. While many assets come in Blender's native .blend format with pre-configured materials, you'll also learn to work with universal formats like .obj and .fbx files. This knowledge opens up vast libraries of 3D content and accelerates your project development.</p><p><strong>Material Creation and Texturing</strong></p><p>Dive deep into Blender's node-based material system, focusing on the versatile Principled BSDF shader that handles most material types. Understand PBR (Physically Based Rendering) workflows and create convincing materials for metal, glass, and organic surfaces. Learn advanced techniques like alpha textures for creating complex shapes and translucency effects demonstrated through realistic leaf materials. The course also covers displacement mapping and material variation techniques, plus guidance on finding high-quality free textures.</p><p><strong>Lighting Mastery with Natural and Artificial Sources</strong></p><p>Lighting often makes or breaks a 3D visualization, and this course gives special attention to this crucial skill. Explore different light types available in Blender and learn to combine natural and artificial lighting for compelling scenes. Master the techniques for creating convincing daylight scenarios as well as atmospheric evening scenes using artificial light sources.</p><p><strong>Cycles Rendering Engine Demystified</strong></p><p>While Cycles might appear complex with its numerous settings, you'll discover that only a handful are truly essential for most projects. Learn which parameters matter most and common pitfalls to avoid, making the rendering process both accessible and efficient. Understand how to balance quality with render times for practical workflow management.</p><p><strong>Advanced Visual Effects</strong></p><p>Enhance your visualizations with professional techniques like Depth of Field (DOF) and Motion Blur. These effects add cinematic quality to your renders and help direct viewer attention to key elements in your scenes. Learn when and how to apply these effects for maximum impact.</p><p><strong>Cutting-Edge Light Groups Technology</strong></p><p>Explore Blender's innovative Light Groups feature, which revolutionizes how you work with multiple artificial light sources. This powerful tool allows you to adjust scene lighting after rendering, dramatically reducing iteration times and giving you unprecedented control over your final images.</p><p><strong>Professional Post-Production Workflows</strong></p><p>Complete your learning with post-production techniques in both Blender's compositor and external software like Affinity Photo. These finishing touches elevate your renders from good to exceptional, with professional tips that make your visualizations stand out in today's competitive market.</p><p>Course Structure and Learning Path</p><p>This 12-hour comprehensive training consists of 96 carefully crafted lessons that progress logically from basic concepts to advanced techniques. Each lesson builds upon previous knowledge while introducing new concepts at a manageable pace. The course is designed so that complete beginners can follow along without feeling overwhelmed.</p><p><strong>Practical Learning Approach</strong></p><p>Theory is balanced with hands-on practice throughout the course. You'll work on real projects that demonstrate practical applications of each technique. The instructor, a practicing architect with extensive Blender experience, shares proven workflows and professional insights gained from countless architectural and construction projects.</p><p><strong>Flexible Learning Experience</strong></p><p>Learn at your own pace with the ability to pause, rewind, and replay any section as needed. The course is structured for independent study, allowing you to focus extra time on challenging concepts while moving quickly through areas you grasp easily.</p><p>Who Should Take This Course</p><p>This course is perfect for complete beginners who want to enter the world of 3D graphics using professional-grade software without the professional price tag. Architects and interior designers will find particular value in learning to create their own visualizations, expanding their service offerings and improving client communication.</p><p><strong>Ideal for Career Development</strong></p><p>Whether you're looking to add 3D skills to your existing profession or considering a career change into 3D graphics, this course provides the solid foundation you need. Blender's commercial-friendly license means you can immediately start using your new skills for paid projects.</p><p><strong>No Prerequisites Required</strong></p><p>The course assumes no prior 3D experience and starts with absolute basics. However, basic computer literacy and willingness to practice are essential for success. Remember that mastery comes through practice – plan to spend 3-4 hours practicing for every hour of video content.</p><p>Why Choose Blender</p><p>Blender offers professional-grade 3D capabilities completely free of charge, making it an ideal choice for beginners and professionals alike. Unlike many commercial alternatives, Blender's license allows unlimited commercial use of your creations, providing exceptional value and career flexibility.</p><p>The software's active development community ensures regular updates and improvements, while its open-source nature means it will always remain accessible.

The focus is on building a run cycle through a disciplined, layered workflow that mirrors the way professional animators approach complex motion.</p><p>The process begins with establishing a strong and balanced base pose. From there, you will construct the sequence by adding nine key poses that define a natural, believable run cycle. Each stage is designed to emphasize clarity, precision, and control, ensuring that the animation develops with purpose rather than guesswork.</p><p>By the conclusion of the course, you will have produced a polished run cycle that demonstrates rhythm, strength, and personality—qualities that elevate an animation from functional to expressive. Beyond the poses themselves, you will learn to refine movement through curve editing, achieving smoother transitions and more nuanced motion. You will also practice effective use of the dope sheet to manage timing and maintain clarity across the workflow.</p><p>This structured approach will enhance both confidence and efficiency, sharpening your understanding of timing, spacing, posing, and anatomy in motion—core skills that underpin professional-quality animation. Most importantly, this method is versatile and can be applied to creating any humanoid run cycle using similar rigs.</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Hi, learning to create profile is important in Revit. We use the profile family as a nested family in Revit wall sweeps/reveals, curtain wall mullions, and stair nosing profiles. Learning the profile family is easy, but knowing the usage is important. Take your time to learn from small examples. I have given a good explanation with examples. Watch all videos so that you will understand better.<br><br>First learn to create a profile for Sweep. You can use a model in place family tool to create a sweep. Apply the profile and check. If you get an error, learn to solve the error. Most of the time, errors occur due to overlapping lines and incorrect joints. <br><br>The profile family should be a single loop for sweep, but it can be a double sweep in case of a curtain wall mullion. <br><br>Adding more detail to the profile is possible with a nested symbol family. For example, for a curtain wall mullion family, you can draw the outer line in the mullion profile family. But to add more detail for the mullion, you need to add a symbol family inside the profile family. For any BIM modeler, creating Revit families is an essential skill. Creating a profile family is an advanced skill. <br><br>All the best in your learning. </p>",

  "description": "<p>Master Photorealistic Bathroom Visualization in Blender + Cycles</p><p>Transform your 3D visualization skills with this comprehensive course designed to teach you professional bathroom rendering techniques using Blender's powerful Cycles engine. Whether you're an aspiring architectural visualizer or looking to enhance your existing 3D skills, this course will guide you through every step of creating stunning, photorealistic bathroom scenes.</p><p>What You'll Master</p><p><strong>Advanced Architectural Modeling Techniques</strong></p><p>Begin your journey by mastering the fundamentals of bathroom-specific modeling. You'll discover efficient methods for constructing walls that serve as the foundation of any bathroom space. The course places special emphasis on creating detailed wall and floor tiles, teaching you professional techniques for cutting precise holes and trimming edges while maintaining complete editability throughout your workflow. This approach ensures your models remain flexible and easily modifiable at any stage of development.</p><p><strong>Seamless Asset Integration</strong></p><p>Learn to efficiently expand your scenes by importing external models into Blender. While many assets come in native .blend format with pre-configured materials, you'll also master working with universal formats like .obj and .fbx files. This knowledge allows you to quickly populate your scenes with additional elements without starting from scratch, significantly accelerating your workflow.</p><p><strong>Professional Material Creation</strong></p><p>Dive deep into the world of Physically Based Rendering (PBR) as you learn to create and edit realistic materials. The course covers essential techniques for working with PBR textures, ensuring your surfaces respond authentically to light. You'll tackle challenging materials including reflective surfaces and complex glass materials, elevating the realism and professional quality of your visualizations.</p><p><strong>Masterful Lighting Design</strong></p><p>Lighting forms the cornerstone of this course, representing the most crucial aspect of achieving convincing visualizations. Explore the various lighting types available in Blender and understand how parameter adjustments affect your overall scene. Learn to skillfully combine multiple light sources to create compelling compositions. The course demonstrates both daytime and evening lighting scenarios using artificial light sources, enabling you to craft different moods and atmospheres that bring your visualizations to life.</p><p><strong>Cycles Rendering Optimization</strong></p><p>While Blender's built-in Cycles rendering engine might initially appear complex due to its numerous settings, you'll discover that only a handful are truly essential for most projects. This course reveals which parameters matter most and what common pitfalls to avoid, making the rendering process both accessible and efficient for your workflow.</p><p><strong>Cinematic Depth of Field Effects</strong></p><p>Master the artistic technique of depth of field to create more engaging visualizations. This powerful tool allows you to direct viewer attention to specific scene elements, adding a professional cinematic quality to your renders that sets them apart from amateur work.</p><p><strong>Advanced Lighting Control</strong></p><p>Explore cutting-edge features like Light Groups, which prove invaluable when working with multiple artificial light sources. This functionality enables you to adjust scene lighting without time-consuming re-renders, dramatically improving your workflow efficiency. Additionally, learn about Light Linking capabilities that allow you to exclude specific objects from lighting or focus entire lights on particular elements, creating unique effects suitable for various creative situations.</p><p><strong>Basic Animation Fundamentals</strong></p><p>Expand your skillset with essential animation techniques. Understand keyframe principles and timeline navigation to create smooth camera movements that showcase your bathroom designs. The course also covers animation rendering and basic editing using the free DaVinci Resolve software, enabling you to create dynamic presentations that captivate your audience.</p><p><strong>Professional Post-Production</strong></p><p>Complete your visualization journey with comprehensive post-production techniques. Learn valuable approaches both within Blender and using external software like Affinity Photo. These finishing touches will give your visualizations that extra polish, emphasizing important details and improving overall aesthetic appeal to create truly professional results.</p><p><strong>Course Benefits</strong></p><p>This complete bathroom visualization course covers every aspect from initial concept to final presentation. Special attention has been given to lighting techniques, which are fundamental to achieving high-quality, convincing results. Upon completion, you'll possess the skills necessary to create commercial-grade bathroom visualizations that stand out in today's competitive market.</p><p>The course combines theoretical knowledge with hands-on practice, ensuring you not only understand the techniques but can apply them confidently to your own projects. Each lesson builds upon previous concepts, creating a logical learning progression that accommodates both beginners and those looking to refine their existing skills.</p><p><strong>Ready to elevate your 3D visualization capabilities?</strong> Enroll today and discover how to create breathtaking bathroom visualizations that showcase true professional quality and artistic vision.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Course Description</strong></p><p>This course is designed for interior designers, architects, and creative professionals who want to master materials in interior design and make smarter design decisions.</p><p>It offers a clear and structured approach to understanding how to select, combine, and apply materials in real projects — from stone and wood to fabrics and innovative finishes.</p><p>Through simple explanations and visual examples, students will learn how materials affect not only the style and mood of a space but also its functionality, cost, and durability.</p><p>The course also helps design teams build a shared language around materials, making communication with clients and contractors easier and more professional.</p><p><br>It’s ideal for both individual learners and teams working in design studios, architecture firms, or construction companies.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will have a practical framework for choosing materials confidently and creating projects that look beautiful, cohesive, and timeless.</p><p>Materials are the true foundation of every interior. They define not only how a space looks, but how it feels, works, and lasts over time. A perfect layout or expensive furniture will never save a project if the materials are chosen poorly. That is why understanding materials is the secret every successful designer relies on.</p><p>In this course, I will guide you step by step into the world of materials in interior design. You will learn how to choose them consciously, how to combine them beautifully, and how to avoid the costly mistakes that most people make. We will explore wood, stone, glass, metal, textiles, paints, and even innovative coatings — and I will show you exactly where each one works best.</p><p><strong>The course includes six complete lessons:</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Why design starts with materials and how they create atmosphere.</p></li><li><p>The Material Code: wood, stone, glass, fabrics, and more.</p></li><li><p>Room by room: which materials to use in kitchens, bathrooms, living areas, and basements.</p></li><li><p>Impressive material combinations that create a “wow” effect.</p></li><li><p>The most common mistakes when choosing materials — and how to avoid them.</p></li><li><p>Where you can save money and where you absolutely cannot.</p></li></ul><p>All lessons are based on my 20+ years of real design experience. I explain everything in simple language, with clear examples from actual projects published in magazines like Architectural Digest and Forbes. You will learn not only theory, but also practical tricks that will make you confident in showrooms, on construction sites, and in conversations with clients.</p><p>This course is perfect for beginners, for anyone who wants to renovate their home on their own, and for those who simply want to understand materials better. It is also perfect for professional interior designers who want to master materials at a deeper level and use them with confidence in any project.</p><p><strong>By the end of this course, you will feel confident with materials, knowing exactly how to choose, combine, and use them to design beautiful and practical interiors.</strong></p><p><br></p>",

I will teach first off&nbsp; a hair dryer as a starting model,&nbsp; and show how I typically surface it and get it ready for prototyping. As we progress in the lessons I will show you how I import 2 case models using an IGES files, identify and repair corrupted surfaces and make sure you end up with a watertight volume ( also known as a closed polysurface in Rhino 3D ) before sending it off for prototyping. You will also be initiated in learning the basic principles of reverse engineering, how you can import an STL file and fix the imported meshes using the Rhino toolbar. I will also share with you on how I prepare a full scale aircraft cabin model in Rhino and the materials I typically use ( foamboards and plywood ) to build a full scale physical mockup. This course serves as a Level 2, meaning it is intended for intermediate level,&nbsp; however users with basic knowledge of the Rhino environment can benefit from it as well.</p>",

There are many choices, suitable for all ages.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is called Autumn Whisper, which is a course to model a bookstore in the form of a schoolbag. In this course, it is only a small course, and the content is not very long, because it allows students to continue learning step by step, shape models step by step, and set up and organize models step by step. Although the model may not have many details, it can help to learn simple tools. Simple model, gradually add details, create different forms or models of the model, but alternate simple and difficult materials to learn new things.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will be one of the large-scale courses in the future. You can choose to study together, or you can study a large-scale course in the future, or you can study a small-scale course until it becomes a large-scale course. For students who want to learn large-scale courses, all four courses can be studied separately. Of course, the content and distribution of each course will be different, and the shape or form will be different for students who choose to study.</p><p><br></p><p>Don't forget to learn and enjoy design, and use your creativity to create beautiful things, or change something, and then goodbye.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Hey there! This is Martin!. </p><p><br></p><p>I created this course to share a method I call <strong>Explorative Studies</strong>, a system I developed to make learning <strong>character design </strong>more structured—and, most importantly, <strong>fun, engaging, and creatively fulfilling</strong>. When I first started studying characters, it was easy to feel lost or stuck copying without understanding. This system helps you approach characters step by step, turning study into a creative and engaging process for anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout the course, you’ll learn how to break down heads, bodies, poses, and expressions while keeping everything systematic. You’ll explore characters from cartoons and other artists, discovering how shapes, proportions, and features come together. The method encourages <strong>experimentation, variations, and playful exploration</strong>, so you’re not just copying—you’re learning how to think like a character designer effectively.</p><p><br></p><p>By following these exercises, you’ll develop a<strong> practical toolkit</strong> that makes studying and creating characters more approachable, even as a beginner. You’ll start to recognize patterns, understand construction, and gain confidence to design your own unique characters from scratch.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether you want to study existing styles, create your own, or simply enjoy the process of drawing characters, this course gives you a<strong> clear framework </strong>to make it both effective and enjoyable throughout your ongoing practice.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>•\tNote: This course features a detailed, real-time demonstration of drawing hyperrealistic hair in advanced portrait work.</strong></p><p><strong>•\tDo you struggle with drawing hyperrealistic hair that looks natural and three-dimensional?</strong></p><p><strong>•\tHave you ever wondered how to create smooth transitions between light and dark strands?</strong></p><p><strong>•\tAre you looking to master brushes, pencils, and erasers for hyperrealistic results?</strong></p><p>In this detailed course, you'll learn everything you need to know to draw hair in a hyperrealistic style — from sketch to final highlight — using professional tools and refined techniques.</p><p>We'll start by transferring only the basic outlines of the hair, without focusing on details. You'll learn how to shade using rough brushes, and how hair drawing differs from other areas in terms of brush handling. Unlike traditional techniques, here the brush doesn’t need to be held vertically; instead, we work with it at an angle, using side-to-side motions.</p><p>In the first phase of shading, we focus only on the dark areas, leaving the lighter parts untouched. Then, we apply a soft, even layer over the entire hair with a large brush to unify the tone. This prepares the drawing for highlights, which we’ll bring out using the Mono Zero eraser for strong lights and the pencil eraser for softer transitions.</p><p>Later, you’ll use 6B or 8B pencils to enhance contrast by drawing Lines that taper at both ends between strands, and blend those lines using Wedge Brush for a polished look. To finish, we’ll add the brightest highlights using a white Conté pencil — but only in areas previously lightened to ensure it stands out.</p><p>Headlines:</p><p>•\t<strong>Brush Techniques</strong>: When to use angled strokes instead of traditional circular motions.</p><p>•\t<strong>Shading Stages</strong>: Building depth and contrast step by step.</p><p>•\tCreating Highlights: Using <strong>Mono Zero and pencil erasers</strong> for precision lighting.</p><p>•\tPencil Detailing: How and where to use <strong>B, H, and Conté pencils.</strong></p><p>•\tLayering and Blending: Tools and methods for<strong> hyperrealistic texture.</strong></p><p>•\t<strong>Full Real-Time</strong> Demo: Every step shown without skipping or summarizing.</p><p>This course is ideal for artists ready to push their skills further. Everything is taught in a clear, structured way with full real-time examples.</p><p>Enroll now and feel free to ask me any questions throughout the course.</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Master <strong>Blender 4.5</strong> with a unique combination of <strong>classical training</strong> and <strong>cutting-edge AI tools</strong> . This course is designed for beginners who want to reach a professional level quickly—without endless theory or long, unfocused lectures. Each lesson is short, practical, and results-driven, so you immediately apply what you learn.</p><p>We begin with the fundamentals: the Blender interface, navigation, and essential tools. From there, you will move into <strong>modeling techniques</strong> including low-poly, high-poly, and working with curves. You will also learn to create <strong>PBR and procedural materials</strong> , build your own reusable material library, perform <strong>UV unwrapping</strong> , and bake textures. Dedicated modules cover <strong>lighting and rendering in Cycles</strong> , ensuring your scenes look clean, artistic, and professional.</p><p>Alongside traditional 3D skills, you will integrate <strong>AI-powered tools</strong> to speed up and enhance your workflow. You'll discover how AI can help generate 3D models, create quick concepts, and automate routine tasks—saving you time while keeping a solid foundation in classic techniques.</p><p>The course also introduces <strong>animation fundamentals</strong> , from simple exercises to bringing characters to life with <strong>Mixamo</strong> and AI-assisted methods.</p><p>By the end, you will have built a <strong>mini-portfolio of projects</strong> —a realistic watch, a stylized house, and a short animated character scene. Most importantly, you will gain the confidence and modern skills to apply Blender effectively in real-world production.</p><p>The course is translated into English using AI.</p>",

  "description": "<p>In <strong>Unreal Engine 5 Stylized Night Environment VFX Lighting, Foliage &amp; Landscape Design</strong>, we will create a complete night-time mountain scene: modular ruins, a warm campsite, layered fog, animated foliage, moon/cloud decals, Niagara VFX, and a confident final grade that balances cool moonlight with warm practicals.</p><p>I am Luke from <strong>3D Tudor</strong>. We will move fast but clearly: blockout → mountain sculpt → non-repeating landscape material (distance scaling, slope logic, Nanite-based displacement) → volumetrics stack → stylized foliage with global wind + WPO grass → Niagara rune and stylized fire → decals for the sky → final lighting and colour balance.</p><p><strong>Top 6 Points about this Course</strong></p><p>· End-to-end UE5 stylized night environment build</p><p>· Non-repeating landscape materials (distance + slope logic, Nanite displacement)</p><p>· Layered volumetrics (height fog, flipbook fog planes, noise volumes)</p><p>· Stylized foliage (global wind params + optimized WPO grass)</p><p>· VFX &amp; lighting (Niagara rune, stylized fire, moon/cloud decals, cinematic balance)</p><p>· Full resource pack + UE5 project included</p><p><strong>What You Will Learn</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Modular Ruins &amp; Composition:</strong> From greybox to clean silhouettes and focal flow.</p></li><li><p><strong>Terrain Sculpting:</strong> Manual mountain forms that read from distance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Landscape Materials:</strong> Distance scaling, slope blend, height displacement with Nanite.</p></li><li><p><strong>Volumetric Atmosphere:</strong> Height fog, flipbook fog planes, and noise volumes for depth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stylized Foliage:</strong> Global wind parameters, instance randomization, vertex-masked WPO grass.</p></li><li><p><strong>VFX &amp; Decals:</strong> Niagara rune, stylized fire, moon/cloud decals for sky control.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lighting &amp; Grade:</strong> Hard moonlit silhouettes vs cozy camp warmth.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Quizzes, Assignments &amp; Projects</strong><br>Checkpoints and mini tasks reinforce each stage; the capstone is a complete stylized night environment ready for your portfolio.</p><p><strong>Who This Course Is For</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>UE5 Newcomers:</strong> You want a full environment pipeline that does not drown you in settings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Environment Artists:</strong> You want smarter materials, stronger mood, and clean foliage motion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Indie Devs &amp; Tinkerers:</strong> You want reusable systems that scale to bigger worlds.</p></li></ul><p>We will take a blank UE5 level and turn it into a moody night scene with purpose. First, block out ruins for a clean moonlit silhouette, then hand-sculpt mountains and build a smart, non-repeating landscape material with distance blend, slope logic, and Nanite displacement.</p><p>We will swap in the modular ruins, stage a warm tent in the foreground, and breathe life into the scene with height fog, flipbook fog planes, and simple volume cubes. Trees and grass get stylized motion using global parameters, vertex masks, and WPO sway. A Niagara rune, a stylized campfire, and moon/cloud decals finish the story. Finally, we will balance cool moonlight against warm camp glow for that cinematic “this belongs in a trailer” look.</p><p><strong>Course Project</strong><br>Create your own stylized night-time mountain environment: ruins foreground-to-background read, animated foliage, layered fog, rune FX, and cinematic lighting. Share screenshots or a short flythrough in the Project Gallery.</p><p><strong>Resources Included</strong><br>UE5 project (5.5/5.6), modular ruins kit (walls, slabs, arches, pillars, stairs, broken pieces, glowing runes), four stylized landscape texture sets (PBR + height), stylized tree + four grass variations, 8K EXR skybox, moon/cloud alphas, fog flipbook, campsite props, reference stills, and a human scale + Niagara base from UE.</p><p><strong>Why This Course Stands Out</strong><br>It is a practical, art-driven build with technical guardrails: minimal fluff, maximum atmosphere. You leave with a finished UE5 project, a robust resource pack, and a repeatable recipe for convincing night scenes.</p><p><strong>Until next time, happy modelling everyone!</strong></p><p><strong>Luke - 3D Tudor</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>The Holistic UX Design Course: Master Universal UX Principles That Transcend Any Tool and Transform Your UX Career With 30 Years of Proven Strategic Wisdom</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>— Course Description</strong></p><p><strong>Have you ever felt overwhelmed by the vastness of UX design?</strong></p><p>Perhaps you've just completed your education or have been working in the field for a year or two and wish to broaden your skill set. You might be a seasoned designer looking to expand your expertise beyond your specialisation. Or you might be someone working closely with UX designers who wants to understand the strategic thinking behind great user experiences.</p><p><strong>Welcome to The Holistic UX Design Course</strong> — where you'll learn a universal approach to UX design that you can apply to nearly any project or technology, now and in the future.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>— Why This Course Is Different</strong></p><p>While other courses specialise in specific software, I teach you to <strong>think like a UX strategist</strong>. Drawing from 30 years of experience across diverse industries, teams, and technologies, I'll share the fundamental principles that have remained constant throughout every shift in tools and trends.</p><p>This isn't about mastering the latest app — <strong>it's about understanding people, processes, and systems</strong>. It's about developing a mindset that makes you invaluable, regardless of the software your company uses or the new tools that emerge next year.</p><p><strong>AI-Era Advantage</strong></p><p>In today's AI-transformed landscape, 83% of UX professionals utilise AI tools; however, the industry is bifurcating into strategic leaders and tool operators. This course positions you as a strategic leader. While AI handles routine tasks, the generalist thinking, systems understanding, and human-centred collaboration you'll develop become premium skills that orchestrate AI capabilities rather than compete with them.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>— Your Journey Through Holistic UX Design</strong></p><p><strong>Section 1: The Generalist Advantage</strong></p><ul><li><p>Embrace the broad perspective that makes you versatile and effective</p></li><li><p>Learn the two core perspectives that frame all UX thinking</p></li><li><p>Understand why specialists often miss the bigger picture</p></li></ul><p><strong>Section 2: Client Briefs &amp; Business Cases</strong></p><ul><li><p>Decode what clients want</p></li><li><p>Align user needs with business goals effectively</p></li><li><p>Navigate different levels of UX maturity in organisations</p></li><li><p>Ask the right questions that lead to successful projects</p></li></ul><p><strong>Section 3: Research &amp; The Crystallisation Process</strong></p><ul><li><p>Map user environments and understand behaviours deeply</p></li><li><p>Study competition strategically</p></li><li><p>Collaborate with stakeholders to gather meaningful insights</p></li><li><p>Apply my unique Crystallisation Process for iterative refinement</p></li><li><p>Prioritise to maintain focus on essentials</p></li></ul><p><strong>Section 4: Concepts &amp; Design Philosophy</strong></p><ul><li><p>Master Object-Oriented UX for scalable design systems</p></li><li><p>Apply Gestalt Principles for intuitive interfaces</p></li><li><p>Implement Systems Thinking for complex interactions</p></li><li><p>Transform raw data into clearly defined content strategies</p></li><li><p>Address systemic issues and identify hidden opportunities</p></li></ul><p><strong>Section 5: Visual Design &amp; Communication</strong></p><ul><li><p>Craft interfaces that are both functional and delightful</p></li><li><p>Dive into copy that guides and engages users</p></li><li><p>Navigate cross-cultural design considerations</p></li><li><p>Stand out from competitors through thoughtful design decisions</p></li></ul><p><strong>Section 6: Professional Delivery &amp; Beyond</strong></p><ul><li><p>Execute flawless handoffs to development teams</p></li><li><p>Manage ongoing projects effectively</p></li><li><p>Implement personal project management systems like PARA</p></li><li><p>Position yourself strategically for future opportunities</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>— Real-World Application</strong></p><p>Throughout the course, we'll work with two comprehensive case studies:</p><ol><li><p><strong>A luxury hotel website</strong> — focusing on public-facing, novice user interfaces</p></li><li><p><strong>A professional SaaS tool</strong> — exploring expert user workflows and complex interactions</p></li><li><p>We will, of course, also look into <strong>mobile and tablet design</strong> extensively</p></li></ol><p>You'll see how the same principles apply across vastly different contexts, giving you confidence to tackle any UX challenge.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>— What Makes This Course Special</strong></p><p><strong>30 Years of Battle-Tested Experience</strong></p><p>I've worked across every major technological shift in UX — from DOS to AI. The principles I teach have survived them all because they're based on human psychology and strategic thinking.</p><p><strong>Tool-Agnostic Freedom</strong></p><p>Unlike others who might lock you into specific software, I provide the freedom to work with any tool your employer uses or any new platform that emerges. Your skills remain valuable regardless of technology changes.</p><p><strong>Strategic, Not Just Tactical</strong></p><p>This isn't about making things look pretty or learning keyboard shortcuts. It's about understanding why specific designs work, how to approach complex problems, and how to communicate your decisions effectively.</p><p><strong>Practical Assignments</strong></p><p>Each section includes hands-on exercises where you'll apply concepts to real scenarios. Compare your solutions to mine — not to find \"right\" answers, but to expand your thinking and validate your approach.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>— Your Instructor</strong></p><p><strong>Massimo</strong>, 30-Year UX Veteran</p><p>With three decades of experience spanning multiple industries, technologies, and design paradigms, I've seen what works and what doesn't. More importantly, I've identified the universal principles that transcend any specific tool or trend.</p><p>I've designed for Fortune 500 companies, startups, government agencies, and everything in between. Now, I'm sharing the comprehensive framework that has guided my entire career — a framework that will make you resilient and valuable in an ever-changing field.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>— Course Benefits</strong></p><p>By completing this course, you'll: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Think strategically</strong> about UX challenges, not just execute tasks</p></li><li><p><strong>Communicate confidently</strong> with clients, stakeholders, and teams</p></li><li><p><strong>Adapt quickly</strong> to new tools and technologies</p></li><li><p><strong>Command higher rates</strong> by offering strategic value, not just technical skills</p></li><li><p><strong>Build lasting careers</strong> based on principles, not fleeting trends</p></li></ul><p>You will also receive<strong> 26 useful, high-quality downloads</strong> to support you throughout this course and your ongoing career, <strong>including a glossary index for future reference</strong>.

  "description": "<p>This course teaches the authentic process of <strong>traditional Indonesian batik</strong>, a centuries-old textile art form recognized by UNESCO as part of the world’s cultural heritage. Batik is not simply painting on fabric — it is a craft of patience and precision, where wax and dye are used together to build layered designs that cannot be achieved any other way. In this class, you will learn the genuine step-by-step method of creating batik, exactly as it has been practiced in Indonesia for generations.</p><p>We begin with the fundamentals: how to prepare your fabric so it is ready to absorb color, and how to transfer your chosen design. You will then explore the process of applying hot wax with traditional tools such as the tjanting and with brushes for broader areas. The wax acts as a resist, protecting certain parts of the fabric and allowing you to build your design in stages.</p><p>Next, you will move into the dyeing process. Using the three primary colors, you will see how batik designs are developed through <strong>multiple dye baths</strong>, each one adding richness, depth, and contrast. This layering process is what gives batik its unique character, as new shades and effects emerge naturally from the interplay of wax and dye.</p><p>Throughout the course, you will gain not only technical knowledge but also an appreciation for the rhythm and flow of batik-making. Each stage requires care and focus, yet the results are always one of a kind. By the end of this course, you will have created your own piece of traditional batik art, a textile that carries both your creativity and the legacy of a craft practiced for centuries.</p><p>This course is suitable for learners who already have some experience with the basics of batik. If you are brand new to the process, I recommend starting with my <em>Batik for Beginners</em> class before moving on to this one.</p>",
