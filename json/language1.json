  "description": "<p>The Modern Hebrew alphabet is only about 2,000 years old, but the Hebrew alphabet has a very long and interesting history that goes back another two thousand years. Prior to this modern alphabet, the Hebrew language was written with a more pictographic script, similar to Egyptian hieroglyphs, where each letter was a picture. These pictures help to define the letter within its original Hebrew culture and thereby help to define the words that these letters are written with.</p>\n\n<p>This course will examine the history and evolution of the Ancient Semitic/Hebrew alphabet from its early pictographic origins to its modern forms as well as its adoption into the Greek and Latin alphabets. </p>\n\n<p>You will learn the origins of our numbering system in the Hebrew alphabet, the meanings of each Hebrew letter, how to recognize the letters in ancient inscriptions and writings and have a basic knowledge of Hebrew word structure.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will also learn about the root system of Hebrew words, how to interpret them and how the Ancient Hebrew philosophy and culture influence their definition and meanings.<br></p>",

  "description": "<p>This unique program to learn Filipino provides the foundation of the Tagalog-based language for non-native speakers at the beginning level. The lessons that I brought from&nbsp;my classrooms to online learning contain simplified concepts that walk you step by step from the alphabet through sentence structures, grammar, common expressions, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verb conjugations, and essential vocabulary. Filipino values are incorporated to help the learner understand the culture. The lectures are presented in video/screencast format and are arranged to be learned in sequential order, at your own pace. Just pause, slow down, repeat, or fast forward according to your level or preference. Resources such as charts and worksheets with answer keys are part of the lessons at no additional cost and may be used per individual student's needs to reinforce skills, write notes, or assess your progress in learning.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Why study sentences? Memorizing the meaning of individual words is pretty much pointless. If you want actual fluency, you need to see a word in as many example sentences as possible. That makes the language start to flow in your head. That shows you how to use the word. How it is combined with the other words.</p><p>Many learners think that effort always converts into fluency. This is not true. You can spend hours memorizing isolated vocabulary and still freeze when speaking. But when you study sentences, everything changes. Sentences are the real deal—the proven method that turns effort into fluency. With just some basic grammar and vocabulary, you can dive straight into sentences and watch your skills grow naturally. You’ll stop translating in your head and start thinking in the language. Imagine being able to read, listen, and speak with confidence because you’ve trained your brain to absorb real patterns, not just word lists. That’s how fluency is built—and that’s exactly what this method delivers. And the best part? It works for anyone, no matter your age or background. All it takes is consistency, curiosity, and the willingness to practice with real sentences every single day. Let's practice together!</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Hello and welcome to “3 Minute Spanish - Course 3” The aim of this course is to make Spanish accessible to anybody regardless of age, educational background or \"aptitude\" for learning. This course leads on from \"3 Minute Spanish – Courses 1 and 2\" and new language structures are introduced to enable you to communicate in more situations when on holiday abroad.</p><p>My method for teaching Spanish is simple but effective. It works for anybody, no matter what your requirements. I have been teaching foreign languages for over ten years and I’ve taught a wide range of students of all ages and backgrounds, including students with learning difficulties, so I know my method is accessible to absolutely anyone, with no exception.</p><p>With this course, it’s almost as if you have your very own language tutor at your beck and call. Take it with you wherever you are and have a quick listen to one of the lessons whenever you find yourself with three minutes to spare. You will be amazed at how much your language skills will develop after just a few minutes a day of study. You will start to learn the Spanish language in a simple, logical and fun way.</p><p>You will learn a variety of words that you will learn to put together to form sentences that will be useful in any visit to Spain or any other Spanish speaking country, and you'll learn how to put the words together to form sentences, saying exactly what you want.</p><p>There is ample opportunity throughout the course to practise what you've learnt, and structured repetition ensures you'll never forget what you've learnt.</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Welcome to course 6 :-)</strong></p><p>Bienvenue au sixième cours de \"3 Minute French\" - Welcome to the sixth course of \"3 Minute French\". This course contains lessons 45 to 53 of the series, as well as a couple of bonus \"half lessons\" I had to add in because nine lessons just wasn't enough.</p><p>This course leads directly on from course 5 and we start immediately by recapping the \"present perfect tense\", which we learnt at the end of the last course. We'll be looking at how to form questions in the past and what different things these questions could mean in English.</p><p>Learning a new tense is something teachers sometimes glaze over, but verbs are the backbone of any language, so good proficiency in grammar is something that will take you far in language learning. We'll be making sure we know the present perfect tense inside out and back to front at the start of this course. There's nothing worse than being introduced to a tense, but then being too scared to use it because you don't quite feel confident enough to manipulate it at conversation speed. Well, in this course, we'll have plenty of opportunity to practise forming the past tense in French, so that when we come to use it in \"real life\", we can do so confidently.</p><p>We'll build on the knowledge we learnt in course 4 around using the word \"le\" to mean \"it\" (aka an <strong>object pronoun</strong>). We'll be learning lots more of these so-called <strong>object pronouns</strong> and how to use them with some new verbs we'll be learning, too. We'll look at how the little words \"de\" and \"à\" can be used in our sentences in ways you might not have thought of, and we'll look at the different meanings of them, too.</p><p>We'll start to explore a second way to talk about the past with phrases like \"<strong>je voulais</strong>\", \"<strong>j'étais</strong>\" and \"<strong>j'avais</strong>\". These aren't in the present perfect tense, but they're part of a different past tense in French.</p><p>We'll also be looking at negative sentences in French and how sometimes the word \"des\" shortens to \"de\" in front of plural nouns.</p><p>Again, this is just a brief glimpse at some of the things we'll be learning in this course, but as always, there's too much to mention it all here.</p><p><strong>Alors, commençons</strong> - <em>So, let's begin!</em></p>",

This difficult situation provided a unique opportunity for my family and I to become fluent in American Sign Language (ASL). My brother was not sent away to a deaf or hard of hearing school. He grew up with us, his hearing family, and we were active in the deaf community.</p></li><li><p>As a police officer and federal investigator, I often used ASL to communicate with and interpret for witnesses, victims, and perpetrators. I decided to create ASL courses because it’s a useful and practical skill to have. Like learning any language, it opens your mind and creates the ability to communicate with a whole new group of people.</p></li></ul>",

    "Such a course is perfect for college undergraduate and graduate students as well as adult open learnerswho have no time and enough financial resources to study Chinese in the classroom setting. They would acquire the same degree of proficiency in two months as those classroom students who studied one year in a classroom setting, thus speed up their learning process, at the same time save tens of thousands of dollars in tuition. Since the course is based on the same range of vocabulary, grammar and situational dialogue topics as college Chinese in most universities, they can be advantageously placed in placement test, even if in the future they want to take higher level of Chinese in classroom setting. As a professor of Chinese who taught for 16 years at prestigious liberal arts colleges and universities, my teaching methods in this online course is exactly the same as I conducted classroom teaching for years. ",
    "This course is also terrific for middle school and high school students who are learning or want to learn Chinese. Secondary school Chinese classes are usually too slow-paced and taught with different range of vocabulary, grammar and dialogues from that of college Chinese, which make these students be placed at a great disadvantage in the college placement tests of Chinese when they go to college. Sometimes, 4-6 years of learning Chinese at secondary school level only amounts to less than 1 year at college level. This course prevents such waste. ",
    "Because this course is exceedingly systematic, thorough and methodological in introducing Chinese sound system, writing system, character stroke orders, grammar and various performance of daily conversation, any learner of Mandarin Chinese, above the age of 10, would greatly benefit from learning this course. The use of hundreds of entertaining powerpoint images bring teaching, reviewing, testing and application into a quick circulation, similar to the immersion learning mode when students have to be highly alert to learn, remember, apply, and perform functionally in quick succession. it simulates classroom interaction between the students and the teacher through exercises (describing pictures, answer questions about texts or pictures, translating using learned vocabulary and grammar ) following introduction of language knowledge at every short turn. ",
    "For students or adults who are learning Chinese in the classroom, this course also provides additional reviewing materials and strengthens your language ability and performative level."

  "description": "<p>Stuck with the old ways of English learning while others get ahead using AI tools like ChatGPT? Feel like you're falling behind but not sure where you should start?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>This course has everything you need.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If you're ready to take your English fluency to the next level with powerful AI tools like ChatGPT, I’m here to help. With hundreds of thousands of students around the world and over ten years of experience helping English learners become more confident, natural, and fluent English speakers, I’m here to help you enter the AI era of English learning. It’s not an exaggeration to say there has never been a more exciting time to learn English…new and amazing things are now possible that we could never do before, at least not without spending a lot of money on professional teachers and materials.</p><p><br></p><p>But the problem is that AI tools don’t really come with a “how to” guide that teaches you the best way to get the most out of them. What is the right path? What are the correct prompts to use? It can be pretty overwhelming. The good news is that I have spent hundreds of hours in the “English Lab” figuring out the absolute most powerful prompts for mastering English from A to Z, <strong>or perhaps more accurately, from A1 to C2</strong>. The result of all that hard work is this course, which covers everything you could possibly need to become a fluent and confident English speaker. The course starts with LEARNING, then moves to PRACTICE, and finally FEEDBACK. You will learn the precise prompts to create your own powerful learning feedback loop. On top of that, you will learn how to adapt prompts according to your need so that you never fall behind again.</p><p><br></p><p>I will walk you through this interactive and comprehensive course every step of the way, touching on everything from essential vocabulary and idioms to advanced practice and feedback using AI. </p><p><br></p><p>Some of the things the course includes:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Techniques for deeply learning <strong>advanced</strong> <strong>English vocabulary, idioms, and phrasal verbs</strong> so that you will never forget them</p></li><li><p>Ways to <strong>master English grammar</strong> and sentence structure so that you can immediately use what you learn</p></li><li><p>Prompts for utilizing movies, TV shows, articles, and books to pick up new English words, phrases, grammar, and references</p></li><li><p>Methods for getting clarification on word differences and complex grammar points that only a teacher could answer</p></li><li><p><strong>English pronunciation</strong> lessons designed to help you sound more natural when speaking English, including specific sounds and full sentences</p></li><li><p>Context-specific recommendations to give you the exact language you need for any real-life situation</p></li><li><p>Discussion and speaking practice with an<strong> English immersion speaking partner</strong> who can help you practice your new English skills and knowledge</p></li><li><p>Casual and<strong> intensive English classes with an on-demand AI teacher</strong> tailored to your unique English learning needs</p></li><li><p><strong>Precise feedback from a teacher</strong> that is even more impactful than an expensive 1-to-1 teacher</p></li><li><p>Building exercises to practice and master English grammar, writing, speaking, and more</p></li><li><p>A complete prompt library that you can continue to hone over time as the tools change so that you never fall behind</p></li><li><p>Challenges with videos to improve English listening comprehension and pick out new and useful language</p></li><li><p>Customizable prompts to prepare for <strong>English exams like IELTS, and TOEFL</strong>, which can push you to the next level</p></li><li><p>Simple corrections and quick rewrites for when you are busy and just need to write something that sounds like you actually wrote it</p></li><li><p>High-level feedback that goes far beyond simple corrections, for things like cover letters, proposals, and more</p></li><li><p>Methods for creating content with ChatGPT, including emails and marketing copy (and almost anything else)</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>By the end of this course, <strong>you will have everything you need to achieve all your English learning goals and take your mastery of the English langue to the next level</strong>. You will also have built a comprehensive prompt library to continue learning, practicing, and mastering the English language. This is perhaps the most amazing time to be an English learner. It has never been so easy to build your English brain and achieve anything you set your mind to.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are excited to unlock the next chapter in your English learning journey, sign up now!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to my German Business Language Course!</p><p>Formal German is not only used <strong>at work</strong> but also when we <strong>make appointments</strong>, <strong>talk to service providers</strong> of all kinds, when we <strong>communicate with doctors, landlords/landladies, building managers, school/university staff and so on</strong>.</p><p>Formal German and business language is different from everyday language. <em>How</em> German business language is different from general German is one thing you will learn in this course. The other one is on which areas of the language &amp; grammar you have to focus.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>We will look at the way people <strong>address each other in a formal context</strong>, at commonly used <strong>vocabulary</strong> and also more specific <strong>alternative vocabulary </strong>(e.g. more precise, more formal)<strong>, phrases and expressions</strong>. </p></li></ul><ul><li><p>I also included the <strong>grammatical structures</strong> that are predominantly and/or used for specific purposes in a formal context. You will get lectures with in-depth explanations, examples and exercises for the structure and function for these four grammar points specifically (in German with English text).</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>For each lecture, there is a <strong>downloadable pdf-version of the lecture presentation slides</strong>. You can access it by clicking on the 'Resources' button of each lecture on the right side of the video player in the chapter/lecture overview. </p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>E-mail writing, presenting</strong> and <strong>talking on the phone</strong> are of course included.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>You will find some shorter vocabulary <strong>quizzes</strong>, <strong>exercises</strong> for the grammar, and at the end of the course, there is a<strong> test </strong>to check your understanding and knowledge of the entire course content.</p></li></ul><p>Generally, on a solid A2 level this course should be manageable and in parts challenging, on level B1 it will definitely fill some gaps and include new material, and on B2 it should still contain plenty of new terms and phrases, though the structure and some vocabulary will be more for polishing up your knowledge. </p><p>With the exception of the grammar lectures, the explanations are in English because the course is aimed at a range of levels, including the ones that are usually not as far in understanding spoken language well enough to follow explanations in German.</p>",

(no note-taking required)<br>► Produce and assimilate thousands of practical phrases for daily use. <br>► Painlessly absorb grammar and vocabulary at intermediate level. <br>► Make rapid progress, without the need to memorise or \"study\" in the traditional sense.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>ALLOW&nbsp;YOURSELF&nbsp;TO&nbsp;BE&nbsp;CARRIED&nbsp;AWAY&nbsp;BY&nbsp;THE&nbsp;METHOD.</strong></p><p><strong><em>\"Tell me and I will&nbsp;forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me&nbsp;and I learn </em></strong><em>.\"&nbsp;</em>(Benjamin Franklin)</p><p>Right from the start,<strong> EL&nbsp;MÉTODO</strong> engages you in a non-stop spoken dialogue that requires no pen and paper.&nbsp;This beautifully simple resource allows you to use and understand Intermediate Spanish <strong>in a matter of hours</strong>, without the need for tiresome attempts at memorisation or lengthy, grammatical explanations. This is achieved through a <strong>expertly designed, world-class methodology</strong> that builds up and practices the language in your mind and mouth, <strong>step by step</strong>, until you are able to form increasingly complex sentences with ease.</p><p>From the very start, you will be forming your own sentences, effortlessly&nbsp;absorbing structures without even realising it. The method guides you through Intermediate Spanish in a motivating and stimulating way.</p><p><br>Recent students put it this way:&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><em>\"Outstanding from the very first lesson to the end. The Spanish is challenging and fast moving, and yet&nbsp; constantly revisits vocabulary and structures so that it sinks into long term memory. Explanations are short and yet accommodate for all learning styles. The whole journey has been a world-class introduction into a language I’ve learned to love. ¡Gracias por todo!\"<br><br>\"After completing level 1 and level 2 , I am here for level 3 and have already purchased level 4. Does it not&nbsp; prove how good and well organised the courses are! It's Fantastic. Beyond expectation!\"</em><br></p><p><strong>LEARN SPANISH NATURALLY AND RAPIDLY</strong></p><p>In EL&nbsp;MÉTODO as in real life,&nbsp;learning is a continuous process, not a series of separate topics. Each new word or structure is preceded by a clear and precise introduction. The process&nbsp;continues as the students use the new word in a variety of different contexts.

  "description": "<p><strong>你好, my friend!</strong> Perhaps you are<strong> an absolute beginner in Chinese language </strong>or have studied before, but now you have forgotten a lot, it's okay, this course is for absolute beginners who want to<strong> learn Mandarin Chinese well and in a fun way.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Each Section of this course will have Two Chapters and each chapter will have Five Videos: </em></strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Vocabulary Words</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Writing Characters</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Grammar</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Dialogue</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Speaking Practice</strong></p><p><br></p></li></ol><ol><li><p><strong>Vocabulary Words</strong>. In this section, we will learn how to pronounce words correctly, we will learn their meanings and I will use these words in examples, we will make sentences.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Writing Characters.</strong> This exercise will also help us to remember characters better. This part is for those who like to write characters. But this is not necessary, in real life we will very rarely need to write characters by hand, since now many people type on smartphones and computers.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Grammar.</strong> Here I will explain in detail the different types of grammar with different examples. These grammars will also be applied in the Dialogue part of the same lesson. In this part, you can also improve your reading skills at the same time as we read the sentences.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Dialogues.</strong> Here we will read the texts of interesting stories, we will practice the words and grammar that we learned in the chapter. Here we will also listen to audio and watch video of the dialogues to better recognize the words. I recommend watching the video several times to better practice reading, listening and pronunciation.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Speaking Practice.</strong> I know it's not really easy to learn to speak the language through video lessons, so I tried to make our course as useful as possible for you, and added a series of videos to practice Speaking Chinese and improve your listening skills. Here I ask you a question in Chinese, you can stop the video and try to formulate the answer. And I will also give you a 'potential answer' so that you can know how to answer such a question. If it is not clear what I said, it's okay, at the end of the video I will show you the answers that I gave to those questions, and their translations into English.</p></li></ol><p><br></p><p>At the end of each section, I also prepared <strong>Assignments </strong>for you to translate texts from English into Chinese, this will help you learn to think better in Chinese. In total there are in this course <strong>40 Quizzes, 20</strong> <strong>Assignments, 20 Listening Tests</strong>, as well as <strong>2 Practice Reading Tests </strong>(in total, there will be <strong>20 texts for Reading Practice</strong>), where you can test your knowledge and improve your skills.</p><p>*******************************</p><p>At the beginning, <strong>I will teach very slowly,</strong> and over time, once you have a certain foundation of Chinese, I will gradually increase the pace of teaching, with each lesson <strong>I will teach faster and faster.</strong> I think that this is very important, given the fact that each student receives information differently, someone needs faster, and someone needs more slowly. But, my dear friend, at any time you can play the video faster by adjusting the speed, you will have such a function in the player.</p><p>*******************************</p><p><strong><em>I tried to create a course that will really help you learn Chinese well. <br>But first I would like to give some useful tips and recommendations:</em></strong></p><ol><li><p><em>Please do not listen to those who say that you can learn Chinese with the pinyin system only. Why? Because you can learn from pinyin, but up to a certain point, then pinyin will not help, Chinese will not be entirely clear to you. If you go to China, you'll realize that</em><strong><em> in real life, pinyin won't be that important</em></strong><em>. If you want to learn Chinese well, </em><strong><em>it is very important to be friends with Chinese characters</em></strong><em>, and pinyin will be a great tool for learning characters, as well as working on our pronunciation, and we will use pinyin for this.</em></p></li><li><p><em>In this course, please take your time and work on each lesson of the course in detail, complete quizzes and be sure that you already recognize all the words and only then move on to the next lesson. Since all lessons are sequentially connected to each other, it is important to take your time and work on each lesson well so that the next lessons do not seem too difficult.</em></p></li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>After completing all the lessons</strong>, you will be able to communicate freely on a lot of topics related to<strong> travel, university life, work, personal life, sports, family, shopping and many others.</strong> This course is perfect for people who are going to <strong>live in China.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Together we can do it, my dear friend! Let's start our journey! :)</em></strong></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong><em>Recent Testimonials:</em></strong></p><p><em>\"I am a 28 year old Vietnamese born in America, with parents from Southern Vietnam region. I've lived my life with an OK ability to converse and a good amount of vocab, but I never learned it properly. Unfortunately, there's very few resources for learning English-&gt; Viet Southern Dialect, since the Northern/Hanoi dialect is the official preference and more relevant for business. Since there were very few resources for improving Southern dialect, I mostly gave up on developing my own Vietnamese. So I was very happy to see a course specifically aimed for Southern dialect on Udemy! After completing this course, I am really pleased with the quality of the lessons. Greg is comprehensive, thorough and attuned to the tonal nuances of the language. <strong>So if you're like me, a Viet Kieu with a desire to improve, this is an excellent course and I highly recommend it</strong>.\" - Kim T</em></p><p><em>\"Although I have not completed the course yet, <strong>I have already benefited greatly from Greg's insight of the Vietnamese language</strong>.\" - Gerald Morton</em></p><p><em>\"I've taken lessons from several Vietnamese teachers and<strong> this one is my favorite by far!\"</strong> - Tiffany Bennet</em></p><p><em><strong>\"Love the building-blocks approach.\" </strong>- Tony Luvonne</em></p><p>  \t This course is for anyone who wants to <strong>become fluent in the Vietnamese language</strong> or simply learn some conversational phrases and vocabulary before making a trip to Vietnam. It's also for anyone seeking to simply <strong>communicate with your Vietnamese friends or neighbors</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t It is designed to<strong> teach you Vietnamese in the shortest possible time</strong> frame by using the same strategies that I used when I first learned the language while living in Vietnam. I'll teach you tricks and tips along the way that allow you to understand popular phrases and slang, as well as how to <strong>properly pronounce the difficult tones</strong> and accents of Vietnamese.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t I have structured the course into short, instructional videos that allow you to focus on one subject at a time <strong>without getting overloaded with too much information</strong>. I have adapted some of the grammar and sentence structures from the very popular language textbooks used at the University of Sociology and Language Arts in Ho Chi Minh City which are the core building blocks of the language.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t Everything in the course is <strong>useful in everyday situations</strong> so you will never be spending time studying something that is not totally applicable in the real world right away. Most language courses have a lot of this kind of superfluous material which is quite inefficient and waste a lot of time covering unnecessary vocabulary and grammar rules. Our course is designed for <strong>efficiency AND proficiency.</strong>  </p>",

  "description": "<p>This course will support you in reaching or expanding the B2 level in German. It will provide you with vocabulary, structure explanations, examples and exercises. The goal is to understand, speak and write German correctly on a higher intermediate level and give your language more variety.</p><p>We will work with a lot of examples to help you understand how certain structures are used in various contexts. All the examples and also the quizzes contain B2 vocabulary, which is (potentially) new to you. Take notes whenever necessary. Later in the course there are also lectures for word building.</p><p>Each topic usually consists of:</p><p>- one or more videos with explanations of structure/grammar and expression (How to say this? How to say it besides and why?), - please note that these explanations are all in German, and if you cannot understand everything, you can use the English subtitles -,</p><p>- one or more videos with only example sentences related to the topic,</p><p>- a quiz,</p><p>- additional exercises (written).</p><p>Sometimes there are also additional small quizzes or further tips.</p><p>With the quizzes and exercises you can practice right away what you have learned. You can download the written assignments in pdf format. They are usually attached to the quiz lesson. Open the section you are working on in the overview on the right and then click on 'Resources' to download the file.</p><p>Some topics have assignments with an individual solution and you can share them with me and other students.</p><p>There are also pdf-files attached to each lecture with the slides of each of them. Through the transcript button of the video player, you can also access a written version of all lesson-explanations (make sure, the subtitles are set to English or German to access the files respectively).</p><p>This course will help you to further your fluency and accuracy in German which will certainly serve you well in reaching your goals.</p><p>Please note that the speed of the videos can be changed in case you find them too fast (or too slow). This setting can be found on the bottom left of the Udemy video player (standard setting: 1x).</p>",

For instance, they should be able to say \"Hei, jeg heter Anna. Jeg er 25 år gammel og jeg kommer fra Tyskland\" (Hello, my name is Anna. I am 25 years old and I am from Germany) or ask \"Hva heter du?\" (What is your name?).</p><p>Additionally, at the A1 level, learners should be able to handle simple, everyday tasks such as ordering food in a restaurant, asking for directions, or making purchases at a store. For example, they should be able to say \"Jeg vil gjerne ha en kopp kaffe, takk\" (I would like a cup of coffee, please) or \"Unnskyld, hvor er nærmeste apotek?\" (Excuse me, where is the nearest pharmacy?). Furthermore, they should be able to understand and use basic numbers for telling time, asking about prices, or giving simple quantities.</p><p>Moreover, proficiency at the A1 level involves being able to understand and respond appropriately to basic social interactions, such as expressing gratitude, apologizing, or giving simple compliments. Learners should also be able to engage in basic small talk about familiar topics like weather, hobbies, or interests. For example, they should be able to say \"Takk skal du ha\" (Thank you) or \"Beklager, jeg forstår ikke\" (Sorry, I don't understand) in response to various situations.</p><p>Overall, at the A1 level, learners are establishing a foundation in the Norwegian language, focusing on essential vocabulary, basic grammar structures, and practical communication skills necessary for everyday life situations.</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Cantonese is one of the most ancient, culturally-rich and complex languages in the world. It has 100 million speakers from all around the world.</p>\n\n<p>This course is suitable for absolute beginners. Although Cantonese itself can be complex, I promise I'll make it simple. I'll walk you through learning Cantonese slowly, clearly and systematically.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In Part 1 of the course, we will talk about the foundations of learning Cantonese: the 6 tones, the vowels and the consonants.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In Part 2 of the course, I'll teach you essential survival vocabulary that will be incredibly useful for anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In Part 3, I'll go over some basic Cantonese grammar. By the end, you'll be able to form sentences and hold simple conversations with native Cantonese speakers!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Many people might be reluctant to start learning Cantonese because they are intimidated by Chinese characters. That's why his course aims to get you off the ground by putting an emphasis on spoken Cantonese rather than written. Although you are still encouraged to try writing and remembering the characters, Jyutping (a Cantonese romanization system) will be given throughout the course, so memorizing characters is NOT required.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Don't wait to get started! I promise learning Cantonese is an eye-opener and an experience that you'll thoroughly enjoy!</p>",

  "description": "<p><br></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\">The whole of the Italian language can be broken down into several different structures. If you take any sentence from any Italian book or any utterance, you will see that it fits into one of these structures. </span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\">I remember one weekend, I was writing some lessons for the week ahead, when I suddenly realised this. I noticed that there are a certain number of structures in Italian, and that every sentence follows one of these structures. I spent the rest of the weekend working out all the structures, and I wrote them all down.</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\">Every structure you learn gives you the ability to say a huge amount. Some structures are used more than others, but all the structures together make up the whole Italian language. Once you’ve learnt how a structure works, all you have to do is insert different words into the slots and you have a sentence. </span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\">This course introduces you to structure 1. I’ve limited each course to one structure so as not to overburden you. By looking at just one structure at a time, you can really get to grips with it and understand its usage. It will help to clarify the Italian language and make it more like a reflex rather than something you have to think about as is it were a maths equation.</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\">Each structure can also help to propel you to fluency; if you can manipulate the structures at high speed, you can start to say anything you want without having to thing about how to say it.</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\">This course contains plenty of practice opportunities for you to revise what you’ve learnt and it also contains some hints and tips on how best to learn and memorise the structures and the vocabulary that goes with them. You’ll learn how to make questions out of structure 1, how to make statements and how to turn positive statements negative.</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\">The Building Structures in Italian series is set out using the same learning techniques as the 3 Minute Italian courses. You can work through the course in three minute chunks, enabling anybody to learn Italian, no matter how little time you have.</span></p>",

  "description": "<p>Hello and welcome to “3 Minute Italian - Course 3” The aim of this course is to make Italian accessible to anybody regardless of age, educational background or \"aptitude\" for learning. This course leads on from \"3 Minute Italian – Courses 1 and 2\" and new language structures are introduced to enable you to communicate in more situations when on holiday abroad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My method for teaching Italian is simple but effective. It works for anybody, no matter what your requirements. I have been teaching foreign languages for over ten years and I’ve taught a wide range of students of all ages and backgrounds, including students with learning difficulties, so I know my method is accessible to absolutely anyone, with no exception.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>With this course, it’s almost as if you have your very own language tutor at your beck and call. Take it with you wherever you are and have a quick listen to one of the lessons whenever you find yourself with three minutes to spare. You will be amazed at how much your language skills will develop after just a few minutes a day of study. You will start to learn the Italian language in a simple, logical and fun way.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will learn a variety of words that you will learn to put together to form sentences that will be useful in any visit to Italy or any other Italian speaking country, and you'll learn how to put the words together to form sentences, saying exactly what you want.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There is ample opportunity throughout the course to practise what you've learnt, and structured repetition ensures you'll never forget what you've learnt.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>HOW DOES THE COURSE WORK?</strong></p><p><strong>English Listening Masters Course</strong> consists of theory and practice. To build a solid foundation of how to train your listening skills properly, you will start with the theory. There, we will cover <strong>the following topics</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>why listening needs to be active;</p></li><li><p>which strategies to use while practicing listening skills;</p></li><li><p>how to choose audio materials;</p></li><li><p>how to work with a transcript to expand vocabulary and improve listening and speaking skills;</p></li><li><p>which activity you can try to maximize your attention while listening</p></li></ul><p>After having studied the theory of effective listening, you will dive into listening practice. There are 12 accurately structured Practice Sections that are divided into levels with the increasing level of difficulty from the easiest (Level 1) to more challenging (Level 2, 3). All materials you meet in the practice part have been designed and recorded in collaboration with an <strong>American Native Speaker</strong>.</p><p>The key rule of being successful in listening is multiple listening to the same audio. Therefore, each of the 12 Practice Sections is based on one audio, and there are <strong>6 guided steps</strong> you will go through in each section:</p><p>A guided <strong>6-step listening training</strong> includes:</p><ul><li><p>Step 1. Listening for the main idea (full audio) + general understanding quiz</p></li><li><p>Step 2. Listening for details by paragraphs and completing multiple choice quiz</p></li><li><p>Step 3. Vocabulary expansion after each paragraph (1-5 suggested words to learn)</p></li><li><p>Step 4.

  "description": "<p>Welcome to <strong>Brazilian Portuguese – The Ultimate Course (Level 1)</strong></p><p>My name is Eduardo Rodrigues and I love teaching as much as I love learning new languages. And I truly believe that it is impossible not to find the ability of speaking other languages thrilling to say the least. When people say that they dislike a foreign language it is certainly because they haven’t successfully acquired the fluency they desired. After all, what’s not to like? When you learn to speak another language besides your own, you are able to understand different cultures, to laugh at different jokes, to feel independent when traveling. It is simply amazing.</p><p>And I know for a fact that the only way to learn how to speak a foreign language is to speak it. You’re not going to learn to speak Portuguese by simply repeating a few words here and there, a few sentences here and there. Repetition is certainly part of process, but it should NOT be the process. That’s why I’ve developed “Brazilian Portuguese - The Ultimate Course”. Short, but meaningful lessons that will have you speaking Portuguese faster than you can imagine.</p><p><strong>How does this course work?</strong></p><p>At the beginning of the each section, <strong>you’ll be able to download</strong> a PDF file with all the activities that will be taught throughout the unit. It is a beautiful, well-designed material containing hundreds of pictures that will help you understand Portuguese with ease.</p><p><strong>Each unit is divided into the following sections:</strong></p><p><strong>Vocabulário</strong> (Vocabulary): It works as an introduction to the unit. Here you’ll learn some important words that will be covered on that unit.</p><p><strong>De olho na gramática</strong> (Keeping an eye out for grammar): this section will bring you just the right amount of grammar you need to do the oral activities in a natural way.</p><p><strong>Vamos conversar?</strong> (Let’s talk!): this section is the core of this course because it is composed of real-life conversational models. Students have to either ask or answer questions following a pattern while incorporating in their sentences the vocabulary that was introduced at the beginning of the unit. That’s exactly where this course stands out from the others because students are encouraged to say the answers orally, and within the allotted time. That’s the best way to acquire fluency.</p><p><strong>Na ponta da língua</strong> (On the tip of your tongue): this section gives pronunciation tips that, over time, will help students get familiar with the sounds that may be key to understanding native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese.</p><p><strong>Leitura! </strong>(Reading!): this section is a text containing lots of words that were studied throughout the unit. Somehow, it is a way to review what the students have learned in the unit, but also to show how much they can now understand.</p><p><strong>Você sabia? </strong>(Did you know?) This section brings interesting cultural facts from Brazil. After all, from where I stand, language can’t be dissociated from culture.</p><p>Besides that, you’ll also be able to download PDF files with lots of writing activities which are also corrected on video.</p><p>Please believe me when I say that I’ve tried my best to create a course that would be meaningful to those people whose goal is to learn Portuguese.</p><p>For you to see for yourself if my course is what you’re looking for, I’ve turned several videos <strong>into free previews</strong>.</p><p>Thank you so much for your time.</p><p>Muito obrigado!</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to my English course for beginners. Here, you will learn how to form sentences in English. By the end of the course, you will have progressed to a pre-intermediate level, because you will have mastered the most common grammatical forms (tenses, prepositions, adjectives, adverbs, modal verbs, comparatives, superlatives, quantifiers, gerunds, infinitives, passive voice, conditionals, conjunctions). I am a British teacher, with more than 20 years' experience, who enjoys using a variety of methods to teach students. I use a white board to explain how the grammar works, and I use pictures to teach new vocabulary. Please speak to your monitor when you are doing this course, and your conversational skills will improve quickly. </p><p><br>The course includes the following:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Downloadable lectures</strong> (via the Udemy App) on the most important grammar topics. (<em>tenses, prepositions, adjectives, adverbs, modal verbs, comparatives, superlatives, quantifiers, gerunds, infinitives, passive voice, conditionals, conjunctions</em>)</p></li><li><p>A range of topics that will enhance your vocabulary (<em>daily routine, time, jobs, clothes, descriptions, holidays, rooms, furniture, laws and rules, comparisons, get phrases, food and drink</em>)</p></li><li><p>I speak slowly.

  "description": "<p><strong>Welcome to course 7 :-)</strong></p><p>On dit que le sept est un numéro chanceux, et en France, le chiffre 7 est parfois considéré comme un « chiffre magique » ou sacré.</p><p><em>It is said that seven is a lucky number, and in France, the number 7 is sometimes considered a \"magic number\" or as sacred.</em></p><p>Well, that might be going a bit far, but I do think course 7 is a wonderful addition to the 3 Minute French series, although I am obviously biased since I wrote it!</p><p>In this course, which contains lessons 54 to 62, we're going to be looking at lots of useful language features and further building our French vocabulary to enable us to speak in even more situations.</p><p>To begin with, we'll be looking at more areas where French and English differ slightly, and why you can't always translate things word-for-word. The word \"<strong>d'où</strong>\" for instance, is a new question word we can use when we want to say \"<strong>where ... from</strong>\" in English.</p><p>We're going to get quite a few new <strong>Vocabulary Expansion Sheets </strong>in this course, which will give us the opportunity to add more description to our language. We'll learn the words <strong>dernier </strong>and <strong>prochain</strong>, as well as lots of new adverbs such as <strong>depuis</strong>, <strong>jusqu'à </strong>and <strong>il y a </strong>(you'll learn another meaning for this phrase that we have met before).</p><p>Course 7 comes with a new tense; we've looked at the present perfect tense in quite some detail now, so in this course we're going to move on and look at the <strong>present tense</strong>. As the name suggests, this tense will allow us to talk about what's happening in the present. We'll look at how to form the present tense for \"<strong>vous</strong>\" using regular verbs and then we'll have a look at the group of irregular verbs who do their own things. We'll also look at another tense that is linked to the present tense: <strong>the imperative</strong>.</p><p>The imperative is the grammatical term for \"commands\", so you can use it to tell people what to do, or equally what not to do. This is quite a simple tense to learn once you've got to grips with the present tense.</p><p>So, that's a little bit about what you'll be learning in this seventh course, but of course there's lots more, including new verbs, new adjectives and adverbs, talking about the calendar in French and looking at some new structures as well as revamping some old structures involving our friend \"<strong>est-ce que</strong>\".</p><p><strong>I hope you enjoy :-)</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Learn Spanish Now: All-in-One Knowledge Course</strong> is a condensed Latin American&nbsp;Spanish (small difference from Spain Spanish)&nbsp;course built to teach students of all levels (from beginners to experienced) in a self-paced and approachable manner that avoids the awkwardness or time constraints of a classroom. This course delves deeper than just teaching you how to say a simple greeting or basic nouns, it actually aims to get you engaged and involved in speaking and writing in the language as soon as your first day through interactive video lessons and lectures, and resources only available to students in this course. In this course, you also won't be bogged down by overly complex technical lingo or terminologies, nor will you learn things that aren't applicable to most Spanish learners (as is often taught in a classroom setting). So whether you have no prior experience with Spanish, know a decent amount, or are just looking for a refresher, this is an essential course for you as it's made for those who want to actually get started on confidently holding conversations in&nbsp;Spanish and feeling comfortable breaking through the barrier of their Spanish knowledge by going beyond rote memorization. Whether you want to improve your Spanish skills in one area, know nothing at all, or want to go back to basics, this course covers multiple bases of the Spanish language such as speaking, reading, writing, listening, and more.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course takes a non-academic approach to guide  you through your journey into learning how to read Biblical Hebrew by teaching you to recognize \"sight words\" in bible verses as you learn Hebrew letters. Instead of trying to memorize 22 different symbols all at the same time, you learn the Hebrew letters by seeing them in action: making words that you can use, giving you new insight into scripture. Learn to read the Biblical Hebrew language using cutting-edge methods. Start to learn Biblical Hebrew as a living language where you can express your thoughts--making the language real.  The course is fun but is serious about helping you start reading Biblical Hebrew.  It builds a strong foundation that allows the student to learn more complicated grammatical items as it progresses.  Many have memorized prayers and blessings in Hebrew but don't really know how to read Biblical Hebrew.  Now they have that opportunity.</p><p><strong>Learn how to Start Reading the Hebrew Bible.</strong></p><ul><li><p>Learn the names of the Hebrew letters and what their names mean.</p></li><li><p>Recognize Biblical and Modern Hebrew vocabulary from words you know in English.</p></li><li><p>Learn how to write each Hebrew letter</p></li><li><p>Learn over 100 Hebrew sight words as you learn the Hebrew letters</p></li><li><p>Recognize these sight words in Bible verses and learn how to write them.</p></li><li><p>Make sentences from the words you have learned.</p></li><li><p>Learn why some Hebrew letters don't always have the same sound.</p></li><li><p>Learn about the way Hebrew works through E-Vreet's English translation.</p></li><li><p>Get new insight into scripture.</p></li><li><p>Prepare to take a course in Modern Hebrew.</p></li><li><p>Prepare for a traditional Biblical Hebrew course with the niqqud (vowel points).</p></li></ul><p><strong>At the End of the Course: You'll Open a Hebrew Bible and Start Picking Out Words.</strong></p><p>Sight words, often also called high frequency sight words, are \ncommonly used words in the Bible that you can automatically recognize without having to use any strategies to decode.<br></p><p>There are no lectures or talking heads in this course. Instead, E-Vreet helps you study,  engaging you in activities that help you practice what you have learned.  It is carefully designed to guide you in a step-by-step process from recognizing the Hebrew letters to being able to actually read simple sentences.  It builds on what you just learned, so you are always reviewing previous lessons.  This course is great for home-school as well as college.</p><p>This course does not cover the vowel points but contextualized the letters in meaningful sight words and sentences. </p><p><strong>At the end of the second lesson, you can read and write a simple sentence in Hebrew. </strong><br></p><p><strong>1. Introducing the letter</strong><br>Each lesson focuses on one Hebrew letter. Find out the name, meaning, and English letter equivalent. The names and place that you already know like Adam, Bethlehem, and David, will help you learn how to recognize the target letter. </p><p>You will also see how a words that have been borrowed from English--avocado, banana, and guitar--look in Hebrew.   </p><p><strong>2. Treasure Hunt in Scriptures</strong></p><p>Go on a treasure hunt with the help of our friend, Ben Abraham, (not unlike Bart Simpson).  Your mission, (if you choose to accept it), is to find the target letter on signs on roads and shops all over Israel.  </p><p> Then, like Indiana Jones, you will search the ancient scriptures for the target letter.  Usually, the verses come from the book of Genesis. The scriptures have been carefully selected for simplicity and to inspire you.  </p><p><strong>3.  The English translation mirrors the Hebrew structure</strong><br>To help you get familiar on how Hebrew makes sentences, the English translation of the verses will reflect the Hebrew format. </p><p>For instance, the English translation will hyphenate words that are one word in Hebrew:  \"In-the-beginning.\"  In later units, it will show you how Hebrew changes the verb: \"And-said-David.\" <br>Take time to read the verses in English. By familiarizing yourself with the Hebrew format through English, you will be prepared learn the grammatical principles in a more advanced course.  </p><p> <strong>4. Special Features</strong></p><p>Find out about the Special Features of the target letter--its extra sounds, weird sounds or if it is sticky! Find out how sticky letters help you put sentences together.</p><p><strong>5. Learn the write the target letter</strong></p><p>Get video instructions on every stroke that you need to make in order to create each Hebrew letter.  You will also be given instructions on how to write words and sentences.</p><p><strong>6. Snap together the letters</strong><br>As soon as you learn the first  letters of the Hebrew alphabet, you will learn how snap together the letters--like lego blocks--to make simple words.  Just as you did with the letters, you will travel through Israel and locate these words on signs in Israel and in Hebrew verses of scripture.  Finally, you snap together the words and that you have learned to form sentences.  </p><p><strong>7. Listening to Biblical Hebrew</strong><br>In order that you can get used to hearing Hebrew, there is even an extra video of the target letter's section of Psalm 119 where you can follow along.  Some of the verses are also in mp3 format.  </p><p><strong> 8. Understanding Ancient Isreal's Culture is key to the language</strong></p><ul><li><p>Click on links that cover ancient Hebrew traditions and major Jewish Holidays.  </p></li><li><p>Each lesson or lecture is about ten minutes long. </p></li><li><p>Some letters have two to three lectures, depending on their special features. </p></li><li><p>Try to schedule at least 15 minutes a day for the course. </p></li><li><p>Little and often is the key for people with busy schedules.  </p></li></ul><p><strong>9. The course studies for you.</strong></p><p> The course does a lot of the work for you: it has be especially designed to constantly review material--it helps you study and retain the material. <br></p><p>Try to find someone else with whom you can study--this is the traditional way. You can even have a class at your home with a few like-minded friends. We encourage you to join other students for discussions and to ask questions to learn from each other at our Facebook group called E-Vreet. And I am always available. Don't hesitate to message me on Udemy. Students are encouraged to join our Facebook group to discuss what they have learned.</p><p>When you say E-Vreet, you are saying Hebrew...in Hebrew.<br></p><p>  \t          Rachel Levy  </p><p>P.S. Please not that we do not teach Biblical Hebrew using the vowel pointings or nikkud. The E-Vreet method teaches Hebrew using context, words and sentences. After completing the E-Vreet courses, the student is ready for the traditional courses that teach the nikkud.<br></p>",

  "description": "<p>This course delves into the details of the UK accent known as <em>Received Pronunciation, BBC English,</em> or <em>The Queen's English</em>. The accent is actually one of many in the UK, but it has long been considered 'a gold standard', so it is this form of pronunciation that we find in Oxford and Cambridge dictionaries. As you progress through the course, you will learn all the consonant and vowel sounds, examining how they are pronounced and spelt. Spelling irregularities, a notorious difficulty of the English language, are one of the many topics that are repeated to ensure that you memorize the sounds and corresponding spelling. You will swiftly learn the phonetic IPA symbols while watching the lectures and doing the quizzes. And by the end of the course, you will be able to speak clearly, concisely, and coherently, just as the presenters on the BBC do. </p><p>The following materials are included:<br></p><ul><li><p>Downloadable lectures (via the Udemy App), so you may watch them on any device at any time (UK native teacher with 20 years' experience)</p></li><li><p>Lectures cover the consonant sounds (fricatives, plosives, approximants), vowel sounds (short, long, and diphthong), silent letters, homophones, stress, tongue twisters, poems, and typical mistakes. </p></li><li><p>After each lecture, a quiz follows which tests your understanding of the topic. These quizzes enable you to memorize the IPA&nbsp;symbols, the spelling irregularities, and the subtle nuances between slightly different sounds.</p></li><li><p>PDFs are included in each section that have numerous tongue twisters to help you get your mouth around the weird and wonderful sounds of the mighty English language. Video lectures are included so that you can practice these difficult sounds.</p></li><li><p>Some of my favourite poems are included in this course; I feel that poetry and songs are enjoyable and effective ways to improve your pronunciation. One must pronounce with passion!</p></li><li><p>Typical pronunciation mistakes examined</p></li><li><p>Ask me questions on those topics which cause the most confusion, and I answer all your questions within 24 hours on the Q and A section. I will be with you at every step of this course</p></li><li><p>Lifetime membership (more lessons and resources added every month)</p></li></ul>",

Thus you have no risk and nothing to lose!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why learning German?</strong></p><p>Learning and speaking German gives you amazing benefits!</p><p><br></p><p>We need you! As of 2023 there are more than two Million unfilled job vacancies in Germany, Austria and Switzerland! And this trend is rising. Especially in the fields of medicine, engineering in mechanical and vehicle construction, electrical engineering, IT and software development, programming, education, health care and social work. It is made easier for skilled foreign workers to immigrate, but in most cases the requirement is to speak German at least on the language level of B1.</p><p><br></p><p>Through the German language you get access to world class higher education! German schools and universities are basically free of charge for everyone! Germany is one of the world's most popular places to study for foreigners. Around 320,000 international students were enrolled in Germany in 2020.</p><p><br></p><p>Make more money by speaking German! Even if you don´t plan to live in a German speaking country there are many international German companies which are looking for German speakers worldwide who earn more than their non-German-speaking colleagues. Some of the renowned German companies are BMW, Mercedes, Porsche, Volkswagen, Audi, Siemens, Allianz, Bosch, Deutsche Bank and Villeroy &amp; Boch.</p><p><br></p><p>Germany, Austria and Switzerland belong to the countries with the highest standards of living. The German speaking countries have diversity, affordability, thriving economies, art, creativity, business, technology, culture and much more! The German economy is the strongest and biggest in Europe!</p><p><br></p><p>Learn German to challenge yourself, improve your brain development and for your personal growth! Learning and speaking a new language also boosts your confidence! According to a study published in The Journal of Neuroscience, learning a new language has a positive effect on the growth of brain cells. The study also found that people who learned a second language had improved cognition, including better memory and faster thinking skills. Furthermore, the researchers found that the benefits persisted even after the participants stopped learning the new language. The findings also suggest that learning a second language can help prevent age-related cognitive decline and can even have benefits for our overall intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>With more than 100 million German speakers German is the most spoken language in the European Union! Thus the chances are high that you can apply German even outside of the German speaking countries also because Germans are the second most travelling nation worldwide and can be found everywhere!</p><p><br></p><p>If you already speak English it will be easier for you to learn German as both languages are Germanic languages. There are hundreds of so-called cognates which are words which are identical or very similar in English and German. Such as the words finger, hand, glass and many many more!</p><p><br></p><p>Germany´s capital Berlin is one of the most popular cities for entrepreneurs worldwide! Virgin has recognized Berlin as one of the best startup hubs for entrepreneurs and job seekers. As one of the most international cities in Europe, Berlin is diverse, multicultural, and full of creative and ambitious talent. Berlin is also much more affordable than other hotspots like San Francisco.</p><p><br></p><p>German is the second most commonly used language in the Science community! Some of the greatest innovators were native German speakers such as Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Max Planck, Carl Gustav Jung, Gottlieb Daimler, Rudolf Diesel, Karl Benz and many more! Also some of the greatest composers and poets like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Johann Sebastian Bach, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller and Hermann Hesse came from German speaking countries! Get access to their original works through the German language!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You Are Nervous About German A1 Exam? DON’T WORRY BE HAPPY!</strong></p><p>Keep in mind that there are hundred thousands of students who have passed the German A1 exam already and who by now speak German very well. If you prepare properly you can definitely pass the German A1 exam! The German A1 level is still very basic so it is not expected from you to already speak German. You are expected to know the basics not advanced German. Furthermore, don´t forget that nervousness and stress makes everything worse as it often keeps you from thinking clearly. So prepare well beforehand und behalte einen kühlen Kopf (keep a cool head as we say in German)?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You still have questions about the course?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>When is the course being held?</p><p>- The course is prerecorded so it gives you a maximum flexibility on when and where you want to learn. You will have access at any time. All you only need an internet connection and a device such as your mobile phone, laptop or tablet.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>For how long will I have access?</p><p>- You will have a life time access to the course.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Can I access the entire course at once?</p><p>- Yes, once you enroll you can access the entire course and advance as slowly or as quickly as you like. No pressure, you decide!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>There are many German courses. How is your different?</p><p>- As Julia is a native speaker she is teaching the standard German which is understood in all German speaking countries, without any dialect or accent. In each lesson just one subject is taught and you get clear and on point explanations. The course is well organized and each chapter and course is built on each other. Furthermore, you get great value for a very affordable price.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Can I really learn a language online?</p><p>- Yes, learning and practicing grammar, improving your listening and reading comprehension, writing and learning interesting facts about Germany and the German culture are all possible with an online course. However, since you won´t have a speaking partner within the program it is advisable to practice speaking German with a private German tutor or other people who speak German, for example.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Isn´t it better to learn in a school?</p><p>- That is a matter of personal preference. Learning online as well as in a school has both its benefits. In a school you can learn together with others with a set schedule. An online course on the other hand is more affordable, flexible as you decide when and where to learn at your own pace and there is no commuting to a physical school needed, which safes you time. So it really depends on your personal preference.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>If you are not familiar with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages; here is a brief overview:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A1 - Complete beginner</strong></p><p>A2 - Elementary</p><p>B1 - Intermediate</p><p>B2 - Upper intermediate</p><p>C1 - Advanced</p><p>C2 - Proficient</p><p><br></p><p>I hope you join me inside the course &amp; have you as one of my students :) </p><p><br></p><p>I wish you lots of success for the exam!</p><p><strong><br>Viel Erfolg und bis bald!</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>The whole of the Portuguese language can be broken down into several different structures. If you take any sentence from any Portuguese book or any utterance, you will see that it fits into one of these structures. </p><p><br></p><p>I remember one weekend, I was writing some lessons for the week ahead, when I suddenly realised this. I noticed that there are a certain number of structures in Portuguese, and that every sentence follows one of these structures. I spent the rest of the weekend working out all the structures, and I wrote them all down.</p><p><br></p><p>Every structure you learn gives you the ability to say a huge amount. Some structures are used more than others, but all the structures together make up the whole Portuguese language. Once you’ve learnt how a structure works, all you have to do is insert different words into the slots and you have a sentence. </p><p><br></p><p>This course introduces you to structure 1. I’ve limited each course to one structure so as not to overburden you. By looking at just one structure at a time, you can really get to grips with it and understand its usage. It will help to clarify the Portuguese language and make it more like a reflex rather than something you have to think about as is it were a maths equation.</p><p><br></p><p>Each structure can also help to propel you to fluency; if you can manipulate the structures at high speed, you can start to say anything you want without having to thing about how to say it.</p><p><br></p><p>This course contains plenty of practice opportunities for you to revise what you’ve learnt and it also contains some hints and tips on how best to learn and memorise the structures and the vocabulary that goes with them. You’ll learn how to make questions out of structure 1, how to make statements and how to turn positive statements negative.</p><p><br></p><p>The Building Structures in Portuguese series is set out using the same learning techniques as the 3 Minute Portuguese courses. You can work through the course in three minute chunks, enabling anybody to learn Portuguese, no matter how little time you have.</p>",

This course leads on from \"3 Minute German – Courses 1 and 2\" and new language structures are introduced to enable you to communicate in more situations when on holiday abroad.</p>\n\n<p>My method for teaching German is simple but effective. It works for anybody, no matter what your requirements. I have been teaching foreign languages for over ten years and I’ve taught a wide range of students of all ages and backgrounds, including students with learning difficulties, so I know my method is accessible to absolutely anyone, with no exception.</p>\n\n<p>With this course, it’s almost as if you have your very own language tutor at your beck and call. Take it with you wherever you are and have a quick listen to one of the lessons whenever you find yourself with three minutes to spare. You will be amazed at how much your language skills will develop after just a few minutes a day of study. You will start to learn the German language in a simple, logical and fun way.</p>\n\n<p>You will learn a variety of words that you will learn to put together to form sentences that will be useful in any visit to Germany or any other German speaking country, and you'll learn how to put the words together to form sentences, saying exactly what you want.</p>\n\n<p>There is ample opportunity throughout the course to practise what you've learnt, and structured repetition ensures you'll never forget what you've learnt.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Zulu has got to be one of the most exciting African languages you'll ever learn.&nbsp;The language is spoken by over 23 million South Africans (12 million speak Zulu as a first language, and 15 million South Africans speak it as a second or third language). Zulu is understood by over 70% of the South African population, making it the most popular language in South Africa. It is also well-understood in neighboring countries like Swaziland and Zimbabwe.&nbsp; <br></p><p>This course is designed to help you start speaking Zulu immediately. We have combined words, sound and images to make it easier to both follow and remember what you're learning. We have included sound to help you improve your pronunciation, while written words will help you with&nbsp;spelling and grammar. Images will help you improve your understanding of the language.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why learn Zulu?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons to learn Zulu, apart from being an interesting language; Zulu is one of the most popular African languages in the World. You can learn Zulu for fun, or as a language of communication&nbsp; that you can use when traveling to South Africa. You can also learn Zulu as a \"special language\" you can use with friends or family in public, knowing that no one else will understand what you are talking about (especially if you live outside South Africa). Well-known celebrity <strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong> has referred to herself as a Zulu woman because of her love for the Zulu language and culture. Some celebrities like <strong>Trevor Noah</strong> (Host of&nbsp; America's <strong>Daily Show</strong>) speaks fluent Zulu. Other celebrities like <strong>Idris Elba</strong> (British Actor) has had fun speaking Zulu in one Oude Meester advert. Learning Zulu will also help you communicate better whenever you meet South Africans abroad.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Becoming fluent in Zulu</strong>:</p><p>Each lesson is also accompanied by a downloadable pdf version which students can use offline to practice anywhere, anytime.<br></p><p>In just 12 weeks of enrolling in this course, you'll be able to count, name things, talk about the weather, greet and hold basic conversations in fluent Zulu.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p>",

  "description": "<p>My name is Andy Krieger and I am an American living in Vancouver, Canada. I was fortunate to attend and graduate from Stanford University. At Stanford, I heard a great speech by President Kennedy's brother-in-law. It was such a powerful presentation that I signed up immediately after, to teach in Africa for 2 years, all based on the way this great man talked.</p><p>Ever since then, I have tried to speak like Sargent Shriver. I am always complimented on the way I speak and I can get my students to talk in this elegant, articulate, thoughtful way. It is TOTALLY related to, what you want to learn, Accent Reduction!</p><p>I was a grade 7 and 10 teacher in Vancouver, for 7 year, after my teaching in Africa with the US Peace Corps. Then I spent 14 years in Hollywood, hiring movie and TV extras (the people behind the actors who don't speak) for thousands of shows. Every day I was on a movie set, and started to LOVE the way actors talked. An important part of my job today is teaching actors how to speak in a certain way that will get them the part. I used this method to also teach Accent Reduction.</p><p>24 years ago, I 'discovered' a way to teach foreign accent reduction. I have taught successfully over 24,000 wonderful students, from Jackie Chan, to Liu Yifei (the star of the Disney movie, \"Mulan,\" to the very, very famous Chinese actress, Li Bing Bing, to regular people, like YOU, who are looking for accent reduction on Udemy.</p><p>No one has ever learned in school how to teach accent reduction, the way I teach it. Not one course on Udemy gets immediately to the basics of my course:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>speak more slowly</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>then you have time to put your TONGUE and LIPS into certain, exact positions, which I figured out, because I speak this way, using my tongue and lips when I speak. It is totally unique.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Then the student brings in and then pushes out an amount of air.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The secret, is making every word have a LONG VOWEL</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>to sound thoughtful and intelligent by speaking with pauses</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>I am dynamic instructor and I do not waste 1 minute of your time. Not one other course on Udemy teaches what I do. Within even the first 15 minutes of the course, you will copy me and be speaking without your accents!!! I have thousands of testimonials from my students from famous actors and regular people, just like YOU. I have had success in teaching students from EVERY major language: Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish, French, Hindi, Arabic, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Russian, etc.</p></li></ul><p>There are so many reasons why thousands of Udemy subscribers would want<br>to take my course:</p><p><br>• you are tired of people saying, \"what did you say\" or \"sorry, I don't understand\" or \"can you please repeat that\"</p><p><br></p><p>• you need to have an interview for a job, or trying to get another, better job</p><p><br>• you want to feel more confident to speak English<br><br>The power points I have made are professional and perfect for learning my Method. I speak directly to you, the student and have you speaking, by copying me. Copy how I tell you to say the word(s). Right away you can hear the correct way to speak without your foreign accent.</p><p>Please message me with any and all questions, I am happy to help!</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>  \t      This is a course that will introduce you to beginning through advanced concepts of sentence diagramming.  There are 13 individual lessons and downloadable exercises for you to try. Each video lesson is between five and sixteen minutes long, and you have all the time you need to complete the exercises: Simply pause the video as necessary.  Each lesson leads to the next, and you will be guided through the course in a step-by-step process that will take you through beginning concepts of grammar and diagramming through more advanced concepts of grammar and diagramming. For those who are more comfortable with written materials, a textbook is available on Amazon. However, the textbook is certainly not required.  Each lesson will prepare you for the next by asking you to think critically and analytically about your interpretation of sentences before diagramming. The course also includes Q&amp;A availability, so ask away!</p>\n\n<p>  \t    Diagramming sentences is a playful, fun way to analyze everyday language!  It's for all ages, from students just learning English as a second language, to students studying Language Arts, to students prepping for the SAT, ACT, or even a GRE.  This course helps students learn to identify the parts of speech, locate those parts in well-constructed sentences, and see the patterns inherent in Standard English.  In other words, diagramming sentences helps students become better readers, writers, and critical thinkers!  </p>",

This is achieved through a <strong>carefully designed method</strong> that builds up and practices the language, <strong>step by step</strong>, until you are able to form relatively complex sentences with ease.</p><p>From the very start, you will be speaking your own sentences, effortlessly absorbing structures without even realising it. The method guides you through basic French in a motivating and stimulating way.</p><p>LA MÉTHODE  does not teach you theory, it teaches you to speak French and helps you achieve this in much less time than traditional methods.</p><p><strong>LEARN NATURALLY AND RAPIDLY</strong></p><p>In LA MÉTHODE as in real life, learning is a continuous process, not a series of separate topics. Each new word or structure is preceded by a clear and precise introduction. The process continues as the students use the new word in a variety of different contexts. Repeated exposure to new words and structures over time, in a wide variety of situations and associations, means that these are <strong>acquired for life.</strong></p><p><strong>HOW DOES THE COURSE WORK?</strong></p><p>LA MÉTHODE, level 1, consists of 20 video lessons of spoken French. After every lesson there is a series of written exercises as well an optional musical task.</p><p>We will engage you in a spoken dialogue that requires no pen and paper. Just talk,<strong> talk and talk</strong>. You won't stop speaking French from start to finish.

Not so fast! </p><p>Take this course and learn everything you ever wanted (or didn`t want) to know about the <strong>German Verbs in the Present Tense</strong> - all the totally normal folks that you will get along with really fast, but also the reeeally special ones - the party people, the scientist, the punx and the sports. </p><p>I believe that after getting to know them all - you will see that they are not so chaotic at all and that with the help of some pictures and stories the verbs will make much more sense. You will be able to remember which group they belong to - without feeling like drowning in the quicksand of the crazy German language.</p><p>When you finally get how to build the present tense of the regular, irregular and other silly verbs - put that knowledge into practice! I prepared for you a list of 30 most useful verbs for beginners. If you learn these verbs - what they mean, how they behave and when to use them - your conversation skills will surely flourish.</p><p>The examples in the videos are in German, but I added subtitles in English - so you can decide if you want to try to understand it by yourself or to get a little help :) The subtitles could be a little bit bumpy in some places, it was my first time making subtitles, but I will try to fix the irregularities as soon as possible :) </p><p>And don`t forget to take the quizzes and check the hints by the answers - remember that practice is the only way to learn a language :)</p><p>After the course, if you still have any questions, comments, things that confuse you, something you want to talk about, or just share your frustration about the German irregular verbs, feel free to drop me a note! <strong>:)</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>Writing is held together by punctuation: semicolons, colons, commas, periods, apostrophes and more. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>But few writers have mastered these small but vital marks and points. Indeed, writers are more focused on grammar and style, forgetting the glue between the words.  \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>Without punctuation, your writing becomes confusing and even misleading. </p><p>A poor grasp of punctuation shows a lack of attention to detail, whether you’re writing a cover letter for a job, a book manuscript for a publishing house, or a research paper for school. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Do you really know where to put a semicolon? Are you certain that your commas are in the right places? </em></strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>Show editors, teachers, and employers that you are a punctuation master with this new course on English punctuation. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>This course takes you through all of the major punctuation marks and points, including my  <strong>Top 6 punctuation</strong> errors, a list I’ve developed from reading thousands of writing assignments from university students. These errors spring eternal in students’ writing. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Do you really know the difference between its and it’s and you’re and your?</em></strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>The course lessons begin with the most common but misunderstood punctuation mark: the comma. Then the course moves through other commonly misapplied punctuation, including dashes, apostrophes, and colons. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>In this comprehensive course, I will help you:\n\n  </p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>See</strong> the importance of punctuation in making correct meaning;\n\n  </li><li><strong>Avoid</strong> embarrassing punctuation errors;\n\n  </li><li><strong>Write</strong> better sentences through punctuating properly;\n\n  </li><li><strong>Use</strong> more obscure punctuation marks appropriately;\n\n  </li><li><strong>Add</strong> structure to your writing through proper usage;</li></ul><p>Join now and complete this course to produce perfectly punctuated writing that impresses teachers, editors, and employers.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not find this course helpful, you may request a refund within 30 days, no questions asked.</p>",

I know how to help students who are learning English for the first time, as well as students who have been learning English for 10 or 20 years but can’t quite reach an “Expert” level.<br></p><p>This is the largest online course I have ever written or taught. I’ve included absolutely everything that I think is essential for you to be fully confident in every communicative situation you might find yourself in when using English, whether in your own town/city, in the classroom, or when visiting, studying or doing business in an English speaking country.<br></p><p>All the lessons are PROPER lessons! That means, I teach them in person as if I were in the classroom with you.</p><p><br></p><p>There are four stages for each grammar point:</p><p><br></p><p>- A taught grammar lesson by me</p><p>- A practice quiz where you can test your learning</p><p>- Conversation practice</p><p>- An end of section “Progress Check” which revises all of the grammar points taught in that section</p><p><br></p><p>If anything is unclear, or you wish to check the meaning of anything on the course, send me a message through the Q&amp;A area. I am quick to respond to messages and it will be my pleasure to help you personally. I believe that all questions are good, so don’t be afraid! Ask me whatever you want about English grammar.</p><p><br></p><p>I am really looking forward to meeting you on the course, and I will be delighted to help you reach the highest level of English possible for you, whether that is simply going from A1 to A2, or going all the way to the “Expert” C2 level.</p><p><br></p><p>Best Wishes</p><p>Rupert</p>",

  "description": "<p>Hello and welcome to “3 Minute Spanish - Course 4” The aim of this course is to make Spanish accessible to anybody regardless of age, educational background or \"aptitude\" for learning. This course leads on from \"3 Minute Spanish – Courses 1, 2 and 3\" and new language structures are introduced to enable you to communicate in more situations when on holiday abroad.</p><p>My method for teaching Spanish is simple but effective. It works for anybody, no matter what your requirements. I have been teaching foreign languages for over ten years and I’ve taught a wide range of students of all ages and backgrounds, including students with learning difficulties, so I know my method is accessible to absolutely anyone, with no exception.</p><p>With this course, it’s almost as if you have your very own language tutor at your beck and call. Take it with you wherever you are and have a quick listen to one of the lessons whenever you find yourself with three minutes to spare. You will be amazed at how much your language skills will develop after just a few minutes a day of study. You will start to learn the Spanish language in a simple, logical and fun way.</p><p>You will learn a variety of words that you will learn to put together to form sentences that will be useful in any visit to Spain or any other Spanish speaking country, and you'll learn how to put the words together to form sentences, saying exactly what you want.</p><p>There is ample opportunity throughout the course to practise what you've learnt, and structured repetition ensures you'll never forget what you've learnt.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This is the first and only course on Udemy teaching business Chinese language. Since China has risen to be the biggest economic body in the world, learning business Chinese will greatly boost your business with China, the biggest supplier in the world market.Through this course, you can learn the fundamental aspects and essential usage of Mandarin Chinese used in conducting business. It has five sections and around 40 lectures, altogether 8 hours. The sections are as following: 1)introduction;  2) business reception, including welcoming your business guests, arranging business meal, taking taxi, registering for the hotel and changing foreign currency; 3) business negotiation, including negotiation of price, packaging, shipping, minimum order and signing the contract; 4) find business partners, including lectures on looking for supplier, joint business partner, sales agent,etc; 5) Amazon FBA business, including participating in Hong Kong trade exhibition, and contacting Chinese suppliers listed on Alibaba. For each topic on one specific business occasion, there are three lectures:  the first lecture teaches the vocabulary and grammar used on that business occasion, and provides sentence by sentence explanation for the business dialogue text. The second lecture  is your text practice of business  dialogue under my drilling (you read after me sentence by sentence and answer questions about the dialogue text), the third lecture is an acting/performing video of that dialogue to reinforce your learned and practiced business language. It takes you about one month to finish the whole course that would be extremely useful and comprehensive for teaching you the language to conduct business with China. The instructor is Professor Hong Zeng, an award-winning professor of Chinese for 16 years at prestigious American universities, such as UNC, Chapel Hill, College of William and Mary, Swarthmore and Carleton College, Hamline University. She has taught Chinese language at all levels, including courses in business Chinese. Numerous American students taught by her have found jobs in prestigious business companies using their learned Chinese skill. Through this course, you would be very confident to conduct business with China in authentic, elegant business Chinese.  Any students interested in learning Business Chinese can take this course, because its detailed explanation on vocabulary, grammar and text facilitates learning from the scratch. However, since business Chinese is understandably more formal and sophisticated in vocabulary than daily Chinese, it is strongly advised that students would take my other two courses, \"College Mandarin Chinese on Your Own\" beginning and intermediate level to learn the basic Chinese sound, writing and grammar system as necessary preparation for this course. </p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Welcome to Learn to speak Hmong course!</strong> </p><p>The <strong>Hmong people </strong>are an Asian ethnic group, <em>the majority are in China</em>, from the mountainous and many isolated regions of China, Vietnam, Laos, Burma, and Thailand. After the United States Secret War in Laos ended in 1975 many of the Hmong, estimated <strong>100,000</strong>+, had migrated to the United States, Canada, France, Argentina, Germany, New Zealand, and Australia. The <strong>Hmong culture</strong> is similar to many other cultures; however, one distinctive difference is that the Hmong people are organized into <em>roughly</em> <strong>18 </strong>last names or clans.</p><p>The <strong>Hmong language</strong> is considered a <strong><em>tonal</em></strong>, <strong><em>monosyllabic</em></strong> and <strong><em>open</em></strong> syllable language. In other words, there are no words ending like the English words <strong>mom</strong> and <strong>map</strong> nor ending in <strong>moms</strong> and <strong>maps</strong> either. Hmong did not have a written language where it was taught and learned openly until <strong>1952</strong> and <strong>1953</strong> when a Protestant missionary <strong>Dr.</strong> <strong>Linwood Barney</strong>, a Roman Catholic missionary <strong>Father</strong> <strong>Yves Bertrais </strong>(better known as <strong>Txiv Plig Nyiaj Pov</strong>), and <strong>Dr.</strong> <strong>William A. Smalley</strong> who came to Laos to help create the Latin script for Hmong so they can learn the Bible. This Hmong language is what we currently use these days, also better known as the Romanized Popular Alphabet (RPA) system.</p><p>There are <strong>eight</strong> distinctive <strong>tones</strong> in the Hmong language, and the creators mentioned above have designated the following letters <strong>B D J M G S V</strong> and a <strong><em>blank</em></strong> as the <strong>tone markers</strong>.</p><p>The Hmong language also follows the <strong><em>subject-verb-object</em></strong> syntax structure. Unlike English, Hmong do not have plural forms, “<strong>-s, -en</strong>” and verbs remain the same form regardless of whether you use it to refer to the first, second, and third person. Additionally, there are no <em>participles </em>in Hmong, i.e., “-<strong>ed</strong>, -<strong>ing, </strong>and<strong> -en</strong>” and no <em>verbal nouns or gerunds</em>, i.e., the <strong>writ<em>ing</em></strong> of this book. More importantly, there is no <strong><em>verb conjugation</em></strong><em>,</em> i.e., <strong><em>does</em></strong>, <strong><em>do</em></strong>, <strong><em>did</em></strong> and <strong><em>done</em></strong><em>,</em> in Hmong. Hmong verbs have just one form like the English verbs “<strong>cut</strong> and <strong>put</strong>.” In addition, Hmong do not have <strong>long</strong> and <strong>short vowels</strong> – just <em>one pronunciation</em> for each vowel. Therefore, reading and writing Hmong is very consistent even words that you have never seen nor heard before<em>.</em></p><p><strong>In this course</strong>, you will learn how to properly pronounce the consonants, vowels and tones. In addition, I&nbsp;will also teach you the Hmong pronouns, simple Hmong words, Hmong greetings and basic phrases that&nbsp;you can apply in real life. And most importantly, I&nbsp;also included a PDF of my book called <strong>Learn Hmong the Jay Way 3rd Edition </strong>published in <strong>January 2023</strong> which you will find it very useful for learning Hmong. </p><p>You will also have unlimited access to my website called <strong>Hmong Dictionary</strong> (<em>upon request</em>) with these benefits:</p><ul><li><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Search over 6500 Hmong words with English translations</p></li><li><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><em>Audio for all Hmong words</em></strong></p></li><li><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Pronouns, grammars, phrases and more </p></li></ul><p>Thanks for your interest to learning the Hmong language. <strong>Ua tsaug</strong> (<em>oua chao</em>) -- <em>Thank you</em>.</p>",

  "description": "<p>The goal of this course is to teach you Hiragana and Katakana the RIGHT way. The way it's taught in Japanese schools.</p>\n\n<p>This course is good for anyone interested in taking their Japanese to the next level. A lot of textbooks don't give exact instructions on how to write these characters. They just show you the character and expect you to figure out everything on your own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of this course is to take different approach - to really walk you through all the characters while holding your hand (not in a weird way! :D )</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riko-chan - our native speaker - has been overseeing the entire course so all of the content is genuine. She also prepared practice sheets which you can use to improve your handwriting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire course is basically a video course. Plus you're getting the mentioned practice sheets in JPG format which you can print out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Module 1 we'll teach you Hiragana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Module 2 we'll move onto Katakana, and we'll show you how to write your name in Japanese.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Bonus Module we'll teach you 22 Kanji characters (numbers 1-10, and the 12 Animals of the Japanese Zodiac).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the course we'll teach you well over 300 words.</p>\n\n<p>Flashcards to help you practice reading the characters are available for downloading as well.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone aiming to write correctly, be able to read manga (world-wide popular Japanese comic books), children's books and eventually novels and newspapers will benefit greatly from this course.<br></p>",

Those are very commonly used and I believe I explained you nicely to be able to understand quite easily.</p><p>By the end of the course, you will be able to start speaking Tamil confidently as a beginner level.

  "description": "<p><strong>IN THIS COURSE,</strong> you're going to learn, practice, review, and master 120 basic statements in ASL. First, we make sure you’ve mastered personal and possessive pronouns. Next, the 120 statements are divided into groups of ten. Each ASL statement has its own video lesson where the statement is broken down into individual signs. The instructor will teach you handshape, hand position, and hand motion for each sign.</p><p><strong>NEXT</strong>, the signs are put together and we practice signing the full statement. After each group of 10 statements, we have mini-review. After 3 groups of 10 statements (30 statements) there is mid-review. All review sections have two parts to test the student’s signing and understanding abilities. After learning all 120 statements, we sign full ASL narratives created with mix and matched vocabulary and sentence structures from the ASL statements.</p><p><strong>*** This course is designed to INCLUDE complete beginners without any sign language experience.</strong></p><p><strong>IN THIS COURSE:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Students will learn to sign and understand one hundred and twenty (120) useful statements in ASL</p></li><li><p>Students will learn to sign and understand over three hundred (300+) individual vocabulary signs</p></li><li><p>Students will master personal and possessive pronouns in American Sign Language</p></li><li><p>Students will learn handshape, hand position, and hand motion for each of the 300+ signs</p></li><li><p>Students will use vocabulary signs and sentence structures to sign full narratives in ASL</p></li><li><p>Students will be tested on signing and understanding ability for all vocabulary and statements</p></li></ul><p><strong>AFTER TAKING THIS COURSE:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Students will be able to correctly sign one hundred and twenty (120) basic ASL statements.</p></li><li><p>Students will be able to understand and recognize all one hundred and twenty (120) statements.</p></li><li><p>Students will have learned over three hundred (300+) individual signs in American Sign Language.</p></li><li><p>Students will be able to use the vocabulary and sentence structures to create new ASL statements.</p></li><li><p>Students will be more confident signing complete statements with the Deaf community.</p></li></ul><p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p><p><strong>What is the main focus of this course?</strong></p><ul><li><p>This course focuses on learning many basic but essential statements in American Sign Language.

My name is Michael. When I was three years old, my younger brother became sick with spinal meningitis. In the process, my brother became deaf with an almost complete hearing loss. This difficult situation provided a unique opportunity for my family and I to become fluent in American Sign Language (ASL). My brother was not sent away to a deaf or hard of hearing school. He grew up with us, his hearing family, and we were active in the deaf community.</p></li><li><p>As a police officer and federal investigator, I often used ASL to communicate with and serve the Deaf community. I decided to create ASL courses because it’s a useful and practical skill to have. Like learning any language, it opens your mind and creates the ability to communicate with a whole new group of people.</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>Meet the Hebrew Alphabet through their five families of shapes. Then learn the sounds of the letters through Hebrew words that you already know. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Learn the Hebrew Alphabet by Learning the Five Basic Shapes and Sounds.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong>Goals of this course:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Recognize the 22 Hebrew letters through 5 families of shapes.</li><li>Recognize the 5 Hebrew letters that are modified when they are at the end of words</li><li>Learn over 22 Hebrew vocabulary words. </li><li>Learn sounds of the Hebrew Alphabet through English words that are Hebrew words too.</li><li>Prepare for the E-Vreet reading course or a traditional Biblical Hebrew course.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When you first look at the Hebrew alphabet, they don't even look like letters--they look like 22 weird shapes. Well, E-Vreet discovered that each letter belongs to one of the Five Families of shapes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of trying to learn 22 shapes all at one time, meet the Five Families of the Hebrew Alphabet. Each family has  special a family traits. Every letter has that family resemblance. The purpose of this section is to help you get used to the shapes of the letters in order that you can recognize them in later courses.<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t     <strong>SECTION 1:      S H A P E S </strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p> Meet the Five Families: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The Horns</li><li>The Circles</li><li>The Staffs</li><li>The Squares</li><li>and finally, the Uniques</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and find out about the Endings: 5 letters from these families that do something different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>VISUAL STIMULUS:</strong> You'll meet the five families flying through Israel.  They are so big that you feel like you can touch them, and that's the whole point--to actually feel like you can feel them--it helps imprint them in the language center of the brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AURAL STIMULUS:</strong> Why is Music so important in learning? Music also helps calm the brain to learn new things as well as helping it to focus--so E-Vreet has carefully selected different kinds of music to go with each family to help you learn as you watch the videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BRAIN EXERCISES: </strong>E-vreet doesn't just present you with the material--like in the gym, it gives you different exercises for your brain in order that you will be able to subconsciously recognize the Hebrew letters.<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SECTION 2:      S O U N D S</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong></strong></strong>Now that you have met the Hebrew letters, you are ready to learn about how they sound. E-Vreet has a special methodology to help you match the Hebrew letter with the sound.<strong><strong></strong></strong><br><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>VOCABULARY</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many Hebrew words that you know--but you just don't know what they are.  The first thing E-Vreet does is uncover 22 of these key words for you.  <strong>Like magic, you know 22 Hebrew words that you didn't know before and you didn't have to study!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why 22 words?  Because each of these key words begins with one of the 22 Hebrew letters.  You already have these key words in your brain.  You know what they sound like. E-vreet matches the first letter or sound of each word to a Hebrew letter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> By associating the key word with the corresponding Hebrew letter, your brain can build on what you already know by grasping the Hebrew letter and cement it to the key word.<strong> </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>IMAGES</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the beginning, E-Vreet uses an image with the key word and Hebrew letter.  For instance,  Adam's letter has a painting of Adam next to it. Once your brain has started to recognize the Hebrew letter with the key word, E-vreet only uses the  image to stimulate your brain to remember the Hebrew letter.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Imaging is an important step in learning how to read Hebrew. </strong> Since you only have an image to help you with the sound, your brain is beginning to rely more on the Hebrew letter to register the sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NOT LEARNING THE NAMES OF THE LETTERS<br></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong>Why doesn't E-vreet teach you the names of the letters?  Because at this crucial point, <strong>E-Vreet wants your brain to focus on processing the letter only with the target sound.  </strong>Learning the names of 22 letters entails another learning process which E-Vreet uses in the next course, \"Learn Hebrew through the Bible.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>GAMES</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each section has games after the lessons in order to help you remember what your brain just received. You get to reinforce what you have learned and help the letters stick in the language part of you brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PDF </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a pdf file on each lesson in which you can review the lessons to prepare for the games at the end of each section.  Print them out and have a hard copy  so you can look at the letters when you are not at your computer.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a quick course to map your brain and get it used to seeing the Hebrew letters. It is based on the principles of semiotics and neuro-linquistics. So don't try to memorize anything. Just enjoy! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course prepares you for E-Vreet's next course that will teach you how to read called \"Learn Hebrew through the Bible.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And remember, when you say E-Vreet, you are saying Hebrew--in Hebrew.<strong></strong><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>The whole of the Spanish language can be broken down into several different structures. If you take any sentence from any Spanish book or any utterance, you will see that it fits into one of these structures. </p>\n\n<p>I remember one weekend, I was writing some lessons for the week ahead, when I suddenly realised this. I noticed that there are a certain number of structures in Spanish, and that every sentence follows one of these structures. I spent the rest of the weekend working out all the structures, and I wrote them all down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every structure you learn gives you the ability to say a huge amount. Some structures are used more than others, but all the structures together make up the whole Spanish language. Once you’ve learnt how a structure works, all you have to do is insert different words into the slots and you have a sentence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course introduces you to structure 1. I’ve limited each course to one structure so as not to overburden you. By looking at just one structure at a time, you can really get to grips with it and understand its usage. It will help to clarify the Spanish language and make it more like a reflex rather than something you have to think about as is it were a maths equation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each structure can also help to propel you to fluency; if you can manipulate the structures at high speed, you can start to say anything you want without having to thing about how to say it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course contains plenty of practice opportunities for you to revise what you’ve learnt and it also contains some hints and tips on how best to learn and memorise the structures and the vocabulary that goes with them. You’ll learn how to make questions out of structure 1, how to make statements and how to turn positive statements negative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Building Structures in Spanish series is set out using the same learning techniques as the 3 Minute Spanish courses. You can work through the course in three minute chunks, enabling anybody to learn Spanish, no matter how little time you have.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>How is your English grammar?<br></strong></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Before you answer I want to ask a couple of questions.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1) When should you use the present perfect progressive? <br></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2) What about the future simple perfect?<br></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you study English but couldn't answer those questions then <strong>enroll now</strong> because <strong>this course is for you</strong>!\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\n</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is this course?</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\n</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is designed to give you a good understanding of the <strong>most common ways</strong> we use each of the twelve tenses found in the English language.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have divided this course into 12 sections (one per day). Each day we will focus on one of the twelve tenses.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a teacher I have designed the course so that you can focus one each of the different ways we use each tense individually.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>How is the course structured?<br></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Each section will start with an <strong>introduction video</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Then, we have videos that <strong>explain when and how we use the tense in that section</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, there is an <strong>assignment</strong> for you to do to <strong>prove to yourself (and me!)</strong> that you fully understand the tense. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have tried to explain each of the tenses in a way that is <strong>very understandable</strong> through the use of <strong>clear pronunciation, enunciation and enthusiasm</strong> combined with the use of  <strong>short videos. </strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why should I choose this course over other courses?</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\n</strong></p><p><em><strong>Enthusiastic teacher.</strong></em>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, I think I teach this course in an enthusiastic way and hope\n that this enthusiasm spreads to you. I believe that if you want to \nlearn anything, you must be enthusiastic or you will simply give up. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>There is a finish line that you can see.</strong></em>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>By knowing that this course is only 12 days (if you one section per day), I hope that it provides \nyou with the feeling that it is short sprint and not a marathon.  \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Consistency is key (or king).</strong></em>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It’s much more effective to study a few minutes a day than to study \nfor a few hours once or twice a week. I want English to be your hobby \nthat you enjoy not your habit that you hate. By only studying for a few \nminutes a day (but doing it every day) it is less likely that you will \ncome to hate learning. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Remember what you learn.</strong></em>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>By limiting ourselves to focusing on one tense per day we are able to prevent the common confusions experienced by overloading yourself with various aspects of grammar. <br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Develop a habit for learning.</strong></em>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, many people say that it takes 2 weeks to develop a \nhabit. I hope this course will provide you with the framework to develop\n a habit of study. While this is my second course here on \nUdemy, there are many other fantastic courses on here to study. I hope \nthat you can use this course as a stepping stone for your continued \ngrowth.<em>\n\n  </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em></em></p>\n\n<p><em></em></p><em>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</em><p><em></em><br></p><p><em></em><br></p>\n\n<p><em></em><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sign up now and start speaking right away!</strong>\n\n  \n\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\n</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you want to learn to speak English more with more accuracy and finally bury some of those grammar demons then why not enroll in this course?

There’s a whole bunch of benefits to knowing French. Let me just mention a few. In our global society you can make use of it in business, becoming a more valuable worker, in private life, on vacation, chatting online, reading literature and press or watching satellite TV. In some parts of the world French is either the main language spoken or one of the main ones. And I could go on and on like that...\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This is an intensive course, which means it covers quite a lot of stuff. The explanations are concise and clear.

The pace is up to you, you can go through the easier parts faster and then take more time to study the more sophisticated ones.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To help you memorize and practice all the new stuff, there are loads of exercises. Most lectures are accompanied by additional resources. These are downloadable files with exercises (with key). There also files with vocabulary revision and, first of all, the main text file containing the material covered in the lecture video. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After you finish each section, there’s a quiz for you that covers the material discussed in that section.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After you finish this course you will be able to use the French language comfortably and correctly, understanding all the underlying rules and thus able to generate any constructions you want, in both spoken and written language. You will be able to use simple, compound and complex sentences and you will know what word order should be used. You will know how the language works and you will get a good feel of it.\n\n</p>",

This is a very important time because while they are interested is when they are learning the best. If you are curious about why something is wrong, then your brain pays complete attention and you can learn and remember better. I duplicate this situation in this course by showing you sentences with mistakes in my videos. I ask you questions about the number, location, and kind of grammar mistakes, and you can pause and think about the answers. After you pause then I will give you all the answers so you can check your knowledge. This is how my students in my university classes improve their grammar quickly, so I know this method can help you, too. </p>",

  "description": "<p>If you are aiming at 7 or higher in IELTS writing, this is the right course for you. There are many reasons why this comprehensive course is successful:</p><ol><li><p>We believe that learning happens when you are doing something, not when you are listening to lectures. That’s why there are exercises and quizzes after every lesson that we teach. To access the quizzes and practice material, go to the <strong><em>Resources</em></strong>. How? If you are on a computer, you will see the resources in the list on the right of the screen. If you are on a mobile, tap on \"more\", which is under the video, and you will see the \"resources\" on the list.</p></li><li><p>We don’t just focus on the structure of the essays! An examiner gives you 4 scores for 4 aspects of your writing: <strong>Task Achievement</strong>, <strong>Coherence and Cohesion</strong>, <strong>Vocabulary</strong>, and <strong>Grammar. </strong>We teach you all the 4 to make sure you get a high score.</p></li><li><p>The lessons and activities have been designed by IELTS professionals from Canada. They are college professors with decades of experience in IELTS.</p></li><li><p>The lessons are given in short videos. We have kept the videos short and to-the-point so that we can teach you important points quickly, without making you tired.</p></li><li><p>The words and idiomatic expressions that we teach are not random and from some book! They have been carefully selected by analyzing hundreds of successful essays.</p></li><li><p>We have planned what you should study each day. This way, you can make sure that you can prepare yourself on a schedule.</p></li><li><p>There are 3 courses in this package: <strong>Task 2 Essay</strong>, <strong>Academic Task 1</strong>, and <strong>General Training Task 1</strong>. So, no matter which module you take, we have you covered. Also, because your access to this course is lifetime, you can always come back if you need to prepare yourself for the other module.</p></li></ol>",

When you speak or write English, what you’re thinking doesn’t come out as you'd like it to. Is this a familiar feeling? Are you tired of feeling this way?</p><p><br></p><p><em>Solution: This course!</em></p><p><br></p><p>Over the last 10+ years, I’ve helped hundreds of thousands of students get over this problem, to become more natural English communicators. Unlike a lot of other teachers, I don’t focus on long dry explanations of grammar rules. <strong>I focus on real English usage. I teach English by example. Why? Because that’s how native English speakers learn English!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In this course, I’m going to give you a completely new understanding of English grammar by taking you on a journey through sentence patterns, which will cover CEFR&nbsp;grammar levels from A1 to C2 (specifically focusing on intermediate and higher levels). Research shows that the best way to really master a language is to master the patterns that make up that language. By focusing on English sentence patterns, you’ll be learning how the English language is put together:&nbsp;the parts, the building blocks. That’s going to give you all the tools you need to put sentences together more easily. </p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the course, if you put in the work, you won’t have that frustrating feeling anymore. You’ll feel confident to express exactly what you want to express in English, no matter what it is. You’ll have all the tools you need. You’ll know all the English sentence patterns!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Some of the things you will learn in this course include:</strong></p><ul><li><p>English sentence patterns for giving commands, and making requests</p></li><li><p>Steps for building all different types of English questions</p></li><li><p>Common English grammar used for describing things, including points of reference and sentence beginnings</p></li><li><p>Helpful connectors for linking parts of sentences together, for better English syntax</p></li><li><p>Common usage examples for when to use ‘to’ or ‘ing’ verbs</p></li><li><p>Effective exercises for practicing new patterns, and mastering new grammar</p></li><li><p>Typical sentence beginnings for any common situation (great for syntax!)</p></li><li><p>Using verbs effectively when speaking and writing</p></li><li><p>Much more!</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Sound good?</p><p><br></p><p>If you are serious about getting really good at English, your next step is simple: Sign up for this course!</p>",

In this course I teach you how to get started as a Japanese to English translator. I focus on freelance translation, but the information is also relevant to in-house translation jobs. The course covers the basics of the freelance translation industry, including getting clients, keeping project managers happy, lucrative specializations, and the future of translation as a career.

  "description": "<p>So you’ve completed an introductory or even intermediate French course, now what? Sure you know a few words and phrases, but you are a far cry from being able to competently use your skills in conversation. Now comes the daunting task of climbing the ever imposing mount fluency, and the hardest question to ask is simply where to start. It is easy to get ahold of French newspapers and books, but you know that you aren’t ready for that unaided. Maybe you have even tried and ended up giving up because you it was too much too soon. You’re standing at a cross roads, and maybe, just maybe this course can help. </p>    <p>This course is there for those of you who have taken some French before, and want to improve your skills. It is for those of you who are ready for their first story, or have seen a few, but would like some help getting to the next level. I’m not going to assume that you can just read a text and instantly understand what is going on. If you did, you wouldn’t need this course, so we are going to take it nice and slow. Here, the story has been broken down into small easy to digest sections, about 4 minutes long, so you don’t get overwhelmed. And then through this course you are not simply going to have the story read to you and then be expected to nod your head and move on. So within each piece of the narrative, you will learn from a number of different steps that you will take.</p>    <p>First you will get a set of vocabulary words, not a ton of them and only the ones that pertain to the section of the story you are about to read. </p>    <p>Then you will read the story the first time. Of course you aren’t alone, and there will also accompanying audio to follow along with. Here each sentence that of the story that is given will have its English translation on screen as well. So if there is a word that wasn’t in the vocabulary that you didn’t know, it will be right there for you, or if a particular sentence is hard for you to understand, you can easily find its English counterpart. </p>    <p>In the next section you will be aided further, because it won’t be assumed that just the English translation is enough for you. Here many of the sentences that may have tripped you up are explained in detail so you can start to understand French even when it doesn’t translate directly into English. </p>    <p>For the final section you are going to see the same section again, and this time you will have already seen all of it, and even gone in depth with some of the trickier sentences that appeared. This final repetition should give you confidence in knowing that here is an entire section of a story all in French and you understand every word of it. </p>    <p>And as you have gotten this far, I have one final note on the story itself that you will be reading. It is a French fairy tale. It was originally written in French and then translated into English. I hope that by now you are at least a little excited at the prospect of being able to work your way through your own French story. Take a look at the previews, as the entire first section is free so you can get a feel for what is in store for you.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This video grammar course is based on the content indicated by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages for levels B1 and B2. But it is not a course only dedicated to candidates for these exams. In addition to the grammar aspect, there is a lot of emphasis on the acquisition of a new vocabulary, extending it to different and alternative contexts. What you learn can and should be used in real language. </p><p>It is a course that privileges examples over-rules and whose aim is to provide a useful tool for all those who wish to express themselves more freely and fully in French. </p><p>This course, entirely spoken in French, improves the level of listening comprehension.

  "description": "<p>What you write is often the first impression people have of you.</p><p><br></p><p>If you don’t know how to write clearly and naturally in English, you will likely be judged based on that. It won’t matter how smart you are or how well you speak English; they can’t see those things because your awkward writing gets in the way. </p><p><br></p><p>So, how do you want people to judge you?</p><p><br></p><p>This course is essential for anyone who needs to write better. By the end of the course, you will learn how to express your thoughts in writing clearly and naturally, without awkward sentences, bad grammar, or unclear syntax.</p><p><br></p><p>Each lesson in this course focuses on a specific skill or approach. Methodically, as you move through the curriculum, you will learn about the fundamentals of strong writing (which are not hard to learn). You’ll master grammatical structures for conveying ideas, describing things, making a point, supporting an idea, and ensuring that paragraphs flow naturally from one sentence to the next. And of course, you will master the usage of style and form in writing, as well as tips for structuring sentences of different lengths and styles. That’s where syntax comes in. If you don’t understand how to use good syntax, you simply cannot write well. It’s that simple.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is filled with examples. That means, everything you learn in the course is backed up by real-life examples that will give you an intuition for the skills you’re learning, which is essential! The result: Rock-solid habits that you'll be able to use without having to think about it. Automatic writing habits!</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe you’re working on an English cover letter, or you want to express yourself more clearly in work emails. Perhaps, you’re planning to take an English exam, like the IELTS, TOEFL, GMAT, or TOEIC, which all require very strong English essay-writing skills. This course will give you the skills to handle any of these, and more. A whole section of this course is dedicated specifically to writing English essays, including how to structure paragraphs and the process for building and using outlines. The essay section is also loaded with prompts to practice your essay skills.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to all the skills and methods you’ll master along the way, I have included exercises that will help you reach what I call ‘automatic’ skills. When you're writing something, you shouldn't have to try to remember what you learned in \"some course on writing you took six months ago\". Everything. Should. Be. Automatic. The exercises shared toward the end of the course, as well as lesson practice challenges throughout the course, will help you achieve that ‘automatic’ level. </p><p><br></p><p>Well, what are you waiting for?</p><p><br></p><p>If you are ready to master English writing once and for all, sign up for the course!</p><p><br></p><p>I will see you in the first lesson. </p><p><br></p><p>-Luke </p>",

  "description": "<p>Ciao! I am Andrea, Italian born and raised.</p><p>I have been an Italian teacher and translator for more than ten years.</p><p>Throughout the past decade I have been a tutor for students of all ages and education levels, including celebrities, opera singers, journalists and editors of the New Yorker Magazine. I also taught at NBC, Time Inc. and Fortuny, etc...</p><p>My students learned Italian, the vast majority became fluent.</p><p>I have developed this curriculum and method over thousands of teaching hours and now you have the opportunity to learn what other students have learned, at a fraction of the cost :)</p><p><br></p><p>Whether you are more of a visual person or auditory, this beginner level class<strong> </strong>is designed for you.</p><p>This is not just another Italian course, showing a picture of a cat, repeating “gatto” in Italian and promising you will be fluent. You could google \"cat\" in Italian. That won’t make you speak Italian.</p><p><br></p><p>Here, you will learn exactly what you need to learn and build the structure in an organic way. We go directly to the point, you understand, you learn, you have fun and you will speak Italian, really. So many students have, at any age.</p><p>During the course there will be time for learning and often time to test your speaking ability. We will also have virtual conversations to develop your speaking ability.</p><p>I will provide you with all the material. You won't need any book. You will receive homework, cheat sheets, do quizzes. You will be granted a certificate of completion. You will also be able to join the Facebook private group and find a community that is happy to speak Italian and discuss about Italian.</p><p>This course lasts a life time, you could go back and revisit, any time. You can access it anywhere, from any device.</p><p><br></p><p>What you will get with the \"Complete Italian Masterclass with Andrea, Beginner Level\":</p><p>- 20+ video lessons for a total of more than 2 hours</p><p>- Virtual conversation</p><p>- Homework</p><p>- Cheat sheets</p><p>- Quizzes</p><p>- Certificate of completion</p><p>- Bonus videos after completion</p><p>- Access to the Facebook private group </p><p><br></p><p>This course is for you. You’ll love it. Sign up! </p><p>Ciao ciao,</p><p>Andrea</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><em>Here are reviews from Andrea's students:</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"Andrea is an incredible teacher. My boyfriend and I tried a larger Italian class, but didn't find it working too well for us. After just 3 weeks with Andrea, we feel like our basic Italian has improved very quickly, and we are having a blast doing it. Andrea is very flexible with timing, and accommodates our work schedules without hesitation. He is very punctual, and his positive and encouraging attitude make every week a lot of fun. We are extremely happy we found Andrea, and we are really looking forward to continuing our lessons with him. Definitely recommended!!! Thanks Andrea!\"</em></p><p>Arianna D.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Andrea is a super friendly person and great teacher. He makes you feel totally at ease learning the language. Within 2 months I went from knowing a handful of words to having a conversation”</em></p><p>Hannah W.</p><p><br></p><p><em>\"Andrea is a terrific Italian teacher. Charming, patient, smart, rigorous and fun. Could not recommend him more highly!\"</em></p><p>Camilla C.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Andrea has been my tutor for 8 months now. He is patient &amp; gracious, but also focused &amp; determined to teach me proper Italian grammar and pronunciation. My lessons are always fun, and my progress continues to surprise me”</em></p><p>Arleen M.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Andrea is smart, charming, always upbeat, and very inventive in figuring out the best way that each student learns. He makes learning Italian fun, even as he is teaching me the grammar. I'm working with him an hour a week to prepare for a trip to Italy. Give yourself a treat and study with him!”</em></p><p>Linda G.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“It is really fun to take lessons with Andrea. He always makes me feel comfortable and encourages me to speak as much as possible, which is really important for learning a foreign language. He is funny, knowledgeable and patient. You wouldn't regret it!“</em></p><p>Miwako O.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Andrea is unfailingly enthusiastic, and always comes to us with something fresh that engages three students whose Italian is at very different levels”</em></p><p>Mary N.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“The course is excellent. Andrea is an imaginative, responsive, and vigorous teacher in a class that doesn’t have a strict format”</em></p><p>Ann G.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Excellent. Patient, helpful, clear, etc.”</em></p><p>Anita M.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“I have been working with Andrea for the last six months at the advanced level. He's a great instructor and i totally enjoy the time we spend together. I learn a lot of about the italian language and also about italian culture. He's very patient and makes each lesson fun. He's extrememly energetic and very kind and would make an ideal instructor for anyone. I'm proud to call him my friend. Highly recommended”</em></p><p>Evan P.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Fun, patient and knowledgeable. Andrea's teaching methods have an ease and feel to them that makes them enjoyable. I feel my confidence in speaking and understanding increasing. Bravo!”</em></p><p>Vincent Z.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Andrea is a wonderful teacher! I was very pleased with his approach which made the basic structure of the language finally make sense! He is also a pleasure to spend an hour with - he made learning Italian fun and enjoyable. Highly recommend him!”</em></p><p>Cheryl R.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Great! Patient, fun and a good teacher. Grazie!”</em></p><p>Perri D.</p><p><br></p><p><em>\"Learning Italian with Andrea was easy and fun. He is trustworthy and reliable! Within weeks of taking lessons I was conversational. I visited Italy in August and my friends were so impressed with my conversation skills. Andrea makes it easy to learn Italian by teaching through conversation - feels less like \"learning\" more like having a conversation with a friend. Thank you, Andrea!\"</em></p><p>Courtney G.</p><p><br></p><p><em>\"I've been working with Andrea for a little while now and he's the perfect teacher! He caters to exactly what you want and really listens to your needs. He is a pleasure to work with and we are always laughing every lesson. He picked up right away how I learn and continues to surprise me every lesson! Couldn't be happier in my choice!\"</em></p><p>Vincent H.</p><p><br></p><p><em>\"Having taken lessons before I am sure Andrea's lessons are the right way to go about learning and speaking Italian. I feel my conversation skills improve in one lesson. And most of all, it’s fun!\"</em></p><p>Josephine J.</p><p><br></p><p><em>The best Italian teacher!!!</em></p><p><em>\"Andrea is a great guy and an excellent Italian teacher. He is extremely reliable and responsive. Every lesson is fun and enjoyable. He has designed the sessions to fit my needs and abilities. I've taken lessons in classroom settings and one-on-one tutor sessions and, by far, Andrea is the best. The lessons are very conversational (all or mostly in Italian!), so it really helps me to listen and learn and understand. He's also given me great tips on how to remember things. I'm enjoying my lessons so much!! I highly recommend him. Lui è il miglior insegnante italiano!!!\"</em></p><p>Howard C.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Andrea is patient, funny and most qualified. So glad i did this!!!</em></p><p>Susan C.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Great tutor and a genuinely nice guy - very helpful, though my boyfriend finally decided to step up and teach me (he's from Italy and is the reason I am learning), but Andrea really helped me get the ball rolling!</em></p><p>Chelsea G.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Andrea is the best!! Very patient and will go over the language with you until you feel comfortable. Even if that means repeating the same word or phrase a million times. :)</em></p><p>Becky H.</p><p><br></p>",

With this course you'll build your knowledge of this uniquely beautiful language from the foundation. </p>\n\n<p>After getting tons of positive feedback for my tutorial videos on YouTube I decided to create this course for those who are starting from scratch yet want to deepen their understanding of the Hungarian language.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with the alphabet and correct pronunciation we're going to cover some tricky grammatical rules that are quite different from English. I am focusing on the ones that give the most headache to English speakers. This course is more than a \"how to say this and that in Hungarian\" tutorial. I broke down some heavy grammar stuff into easily understandable pieces so that you have a solid base you can build on.</p>",

In this course, you will build a basic foundation for Nepali speaking by learning the basic pattern of Nepali and then build upon those concepts and be conversational by the end of the course. <br></p><p>This course includes: <br></p><ul><li><p>lectures for the target structures</p></li><li><p>listening and speaking practice for every single Nepali sentence structure</p></li><li><p>future updates - this course will continue to grow and grow</p></li><li><p>PDF transcripts</p></li></ul><p>Each section focuses on one, two, or three target structures so that you can <strong>master each one</strong> and <strong>produce it accurately</strong> in your spoken English.</p><p>If you want to speak Nepali more clearly, if you want to sound more native-like, or if you simply want to take your Nepali to the next level, this course can help you achieve your goal of <strong>improving your Nepali.</strong></p><p>By the end of this course, you will feel comfortable speaking and carry on a conversation with any Nepali speaker and even travel to Nepali with more or less confidence. I look forward to seeing you on the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Welcome to course 8 :-)</strong></p><p>This is the eighth installment of the 3 Minute French series, and it consists of lessons 63 to 71. It's one of the longest courses in this series, and we start off by having a very in-depth look at the present tense.</p><p>We ended course 7 by looking at forming the present tense for \"<strong>vous</strong>\", as well as the imperative. We begin this course by going into more depth with the imperative and then looking at the full present tense, warts and all!</p><p>Remember in course 4, we looked at <strong>Building Structures</strong>, and we were introduced to the first French structure? Well, in this course, we're going to look at the second structure in French.</p><p>As well as the present tense and the second French structure, we have lots more to look at in this course. We devote an entire lesson looking at French pronuciation.</p><p><strong>French Pronunciation</strong></p><p>Most French courses start off by looking at a ginormous long list of pronunciation rules before giving you even one word to pronounce. In 3 Minute French, I give you new words and show you how to pronounce them as and when we come to them. I've mentioned little pronunciation tips here and there, but nothing too burdensome.</p><p>Now that you've amassed quite a large vocabulary, and you know how to pronounce each of those words, we can use them to learn how to pronounce new words. In the pronunciation lesson, we'll be looking at French consonants, vowels and glottal stops, and how we can now start to use pronunciation rules to figure out how to say just about any word we come across.</p><p>After the pronunciation lesson, we'll be learning lots of new verbs and verb phrases that will really boost our language skills. We'll begin to look at how to use \"<strong>ce que</strong>\" in French and how it differs from the word \"<strong>que</strong>\". We'll also delve further into the world of object pronouns, and how their position in a sentence can change if we use the imperative.</p><p>As I said, this is the longest course in the series so far, so don't rush through it. Let yourself have time after each lesson to process what you've learnt and to practise forming your own sentences using the different tenses and different words and structures that we've been learning.</p><p>I've hardly touched on the full extent of what we're going to be learning in this course, but a few more things we'll be looking at include:</p><ul><li><p>Tips to make you sound more French</p></li><li><p>Using <strong>cet </strong>instead of <strong>ce</strong></p></li><li><p>Using the words <strong>de </strong>and <strong>à </strong>with certain verbs to mean \"to\"</p></li><li><p>Telling somebody to leave you alone in French</p></li><li><p>Looking at the word <strong>dans</strong></p></li></ul><p>As always, I hope you really enjoy this course.</p><p><strong>Bon apprentissage</strong> | <em>Happy learning</em></p>",

  "description": "<p>The whole of the French language can be broken down into several different structures. If you take any sentence from any French book or any utterance, you will see that it fits into one of these structures. </p>\n\n<p>I remember one weekend, I was writing some lessons for the week ahead, when I suddenly realised this. I noticed that there are a certain number of structures in French, and that every sentence follows one of these structures. I spent the rest of the weekend working out all the structures, and I wrote them all down.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Every structure you learn gives you the ability to say a huge amount. Some structures are used more than others, but all the structures together make up the whole French language. Once you’ve learnt how a structure works, all you have to do is insert different words into the slots and you have a sentence. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course introduces you to structure 2. I’ve limited each course to one structure so as not to overburden you. By looking at just one structure at a time, you can really get to grips with it and understand its usage. It will help to clarify the French language and make it more like a reflex rather than something you have to think about as is it were a maths equation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Each structure can also help to propel you to fluency; if you can manipulate the structures at high speed, you can start to say anything you want without having to thing about how to say it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course contains plenty of practice opportunities for you to revise what you’ve learnt and it also contains some hints and tips on how best to learn and memorise the structures and the vocabulary that goes with them. You’ll learn how to make questions out of structure 2, how to make statements and how to turn positive statements negative.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The Building Structures in French series is set out using the same learning techniques as the 3 Minute French courses. You can work through the course in three minute chunks, enabling anybody to learn French, no matter how little time you have.</p>",

  "description": "<p>“I don’t know what I am doing wrong.” “Real-life English isn’t like my language classes at school.” “I keep making mistakes.” “I can’t understand people.” “I thought I had mastered the basics, but there’s always more to learn.”</p><p><br></p><p>For over 20 years as an English teacher, I have heard these same questions from students over and over again.</p><p><br></p><p>As a University Senior Lecturer in General English, Academic English and Business English, I have been able to create courses to help degree students who had paid tens of thousands of pounds, dollars or euros for the services of my lecturing team.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Through Udemy, I can now offer university standard teaching on advanced grammar points to everyone, including you, for just the price of a few cups of coffee.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This course is especially designed for students who have reached a high level of English but find they are still making mistakes. I have compiled this course using my experience of teaching thousands of advanced English learners and the errors they make that prevent them from speaking or writing like a native English user. </p><p><br></p><p>The topics of the course will look familiar to a long-term learner of English. However, each lesson goes far deeper than a standard coursebook, examining issues that tend to cause difficulties for learners within some of the most common grammatical areas. </p><p><br></p><p>If you are an advanced learner, this course will be useful for \"filling in\" the gaps in your knowledge; you will know some of the points, but it is likely that you will quickly encounter new points, or language issues that you are less confident in and need to check what you believe is correct.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am one of the most experienced and qualified English teachers on Udemy</strong>. I have taught English to degree, MA&nbsp;and PhD&nbsp;students for more than a decade, and my qualifications include an MA in Applied Linguistics and TEFL (Distinction). I&nbsp;have also led large lecturing teams, overseen the development of IELTS-equivalent university entrance tests, and have been a Trinity teacher trainer for new English language instructors.</p><p><br></p><p>The course will teach you <strong>over 100 grammar points</strong>, and, in particular, contains <strong>50 key grammar rules that speakers should not make mistakes with if they wish to reach a native level of English</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>You will benefit from this course by:</p><ul><li><p>Learning how to avoid errors with words and phrases at a higher level</p></li><li><p>Developing more effective and accurate use of modal verbs</p></li><li><p>Mastering complex choices between tenses</p></li><li><p>Building expertise in how to use articles</p></li><li><p>Growing in advanced knowledge of how to use many other grammatical features, such as issues with the passive form, advanced English phrases, inversion and cleft sentences</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Included in the course are:</p><ul><li><p>Short lectures looking at language points in detail</p></li><li><p>Practice tasks on each grammar point covered</p></li><li><p>The 50 key grammar rules in PDF&nbsp;form (included in \"Resources\"&nbsp;after the \"Introduction\" video)</p></li><li><p>A&nbsp;final test on the 50 key grammar rules</p></li><li><p>PDFs summarising most video lessons and tasks, with additional exercises</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Because this is <strong>a course for high intermediate and advanced learners of English</strong>, I go straight to the points which I have found to cause advanced learners most difficulties, without spending undue time on less demanding points.</p><p><br></p><p>So, this course will be<strong> ideal for you if you are:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>A top advanced learner</strong> (e.g. C2 or IELTS 8.0+) who wants to develop and check their knowledge of complex grammar points</p></li><li><p><strong>A learner on the journey from being intermediate to advanced</strong> (B2-C1 or IELTS 6.0-7.5), who wishes to progress to a higher C1 or C2 level of English</p></li><li><p><strong>An English Language teacher who is starting out</strong>, and wants to grow in confidence in their teaching of the hardest grammatical structures</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>At an advanced level, learning needs differ from student to student. That is why I will be<strong> adding new videos regularly</strong>, based upon the mostly common requested topics. So, if there is a grammar point you would like to see added to the course, let me know in the questions and answers section (only available to students who sign up for the course).</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>You might know the difference between <em>kaufen</em> and <em>einkaufen</em>, and maybe the difference between <em>packen</em> and <em>einpacken</em>. But do you know all the different meanings of <em>vorgehen</em>? And when is the opposite <em>nachgehen</em>, and when <em>nachkommen</em>? Or is it <em>hintergehen</em>?</p><p>German verbs can be a real challenge!</p><p>For this course I collected all kinds of different verbs, the ones, that are synonymous but not always, the ones that have more than one meaning and the ones that you can use instead of generic verbs, so you can make your language more interesting and precise. The focus is on useful verbs, not on exotic ones, so you will actually be able to use them.</p><p>There are short tests for each lecture in the 'Verben'-section, so you can practice how to use the verbs you study, put them in sentences, and have a few more examples at hand. After all the lectures about verbs, there is also a multiple choice test about everything you've learned.</p><p>At the end of the course there is a grammar section. This contains all the grammatical explanations of the verbs from level A1 to level B1, so that you can repeat everything again and fill in any gaps. </p><p>If you are unable to follow the explanations in German (the \"free speech\" might be a bit too much for some learners), you can use the English subtitles. Keep in mind, that for practical reasons they aren't word-by-word translations. Learners on higher levels can train their listening by using the German subtitles parallel to the audio. Of course, you can also turn them off completely.</p><p>In addition to the video material, the video presentation is available for download as a pdf file. To do so, open the lesson overview to the right of the video player and click on 'Resources' for each lecture.</p><p>There are also pdf files with an overview of the verbs and their structure. You can find these under 'Resources' every few lectures.</p><p>Enjoy the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to this complete Italian course for English speakers</p><p><br></p><p>I created this course thinking of 3 fundamental things:</p><p><br></p><p>1. The phrases, dialogues and words that I use in this course are useful, they are the words of a frequency list, that is, the list of words that are most used in a language in order of frequency.</p><p><br></p><p>2. I structured this course in 3 different types of classes:</p><p><br></p><p>Communication classes,</p><p>vocabulary classes and</p><p>essential grammar classes</p><p><br></p><p>The grammar rules are clear and explained in a simple way with clear examples and exercises.</p><p><br></p><p>3. The exercises are mainly active translation, English-Italian translations, I will say the sentences in English and you have to translate them into Italian.</p><p>You can see the sentences on the screen only after saying the phrases in Italian aloud,</p><p><br></p><p>There are some texts to write, that correspond to the writing parts of the level A1 of Italian certification exams. (CILS A1)</p><p><br></p><p>What I recommend is that you notice the mistakes you make, and if in one exercise you made too many mistakes, I recommend you do it again.</p><p><br></p><p>This type of exercise has many advantages: it is very useful for the brain to be fast in the active language, you will immediately notice the different structures that exist in Italian and English, it reduces the time of linguistic decoding, it gives you an immediate answer concerning your progress and this thing increases motivation. You can listen to the audio of these exercises in down time: by car, at the post office or just when you are going for a walk, I always do it when I learn a new language.</p>",

  "description": "<p><em>Please note that all spoken content in this course is in Swedish.</em></p><p>Swedish conversation with Swedish4Real is an audio-based Swedish language course for those of you who have familiarised yourselves with Swedish but don't yet feel comfortable in speaking it. </p><p>Listen to the original content of 18 stories and follow-up dialogues, adding more complexity for each unit. The course covers most daily situations and topics of life in Sweden, giving you a robust vocabulary to get you comfortably speaking with natives.</p><p>This Swedish language course includes more than five hours of spoken Swedish, divided into 18 themes. Listen and partake in simulated conversations in Swedish. It also includes a 150-page PDF transcript in Swedish and English.</p><p><br></p><p>Each chapter is based on a theme and consists of four units:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A) Berättelse</strong></p><p>In the first unit of each chapter, we read you a very short story, slowly and clearly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>B) Dialog</strong></p><p>The second unit consists of questions and answers based on the story, with pauses for you to partake in the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>C) Expansion</strong></p><p>The third unit is an expansion of the theme and also contains a conversation simulator.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>D) Perspektiv</strong></p><p>In the fourth unit of each chapter, we read the original story from a different grammatical perspective.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to the content repeatedly, many times, and let your responses become natural and intuitive. The video lessons include the transcript in Swedish, and there is also a PDF file with the entire transcript in Swedish and English that you can consult when you need to. However, remember that the point of the course is listening and speaking, so don’t get too hung up on reading.</p><p>After the eighteen chapters, you’ll have the building blocks you need in order to speak Swedish naturally and automatically, without worrying about getting it right. </p><p>We recommend that you listen to each chapter a number of times before moving on to the next. Only you can decide when you feel confident in moving on, but try to make sure that you can comfortably respond to the questions. If staying with the same lesson gets repetitive and boring, do move on and go back to the lesson later on. Although the lessons get more and more complex along the way, you don’t necessarily have to listen to them in the right order – remember that language learning is about having fun: we believe you learn better that way.</p><p><br></p>",

Studies (Nation 1990) show that the top 1000 words account for 85% of speech. This clearly demonstrates that by mastering the most frequent and widely used vocabulary, you can acquire a lexicon that will serve you well in most situations.</p><p><strong>Why Choose This Course?</strong></p><p>This course is structured as a collection of key Dutch vocabulary words grouped by topic. The words were carefully selected and represent some of the most common and frequently used words in the Dutch language. <br><br>Here's what makes our course so powerful:</p><p><strong>Logical Organization</strong>: Words are grouped into 11 main categories and 72 topic-related subcategories, building connections between words that reinforce your memory.</p><p><strong>Visual Aid</strong>: Each word is accompanied by an image to enhance retention.</p><p><strong>Context Matters</strong>: Humans retain new language best when presented within context. Sample phrases and sentences demonstrate key-word usage, allowing you to effortlessly master essential vocabulary and other key terms.</p><p><strong>Authentic Audio &amp; Video</strong>: I have personally prepared and recorded all Dutch audio and video content for this course. Not only will you develop listening skills, but you'll also quickly acquire native pronunciation, pitch, intonation, and rhythm.</p><p><strong>Engaging Quizzes</strong>: Fun, short quizzes, and additional multiple-choice exercises accelerate the acquisition and retention of core vocabulary and sentence structure.</p><p><strong>Basic Grammar Explained</strong>: Short grammar explanations cover basic grammar points, enhancing your understanding of word usage (e.g., plurals, verb conjugation, personal pronouns, adjectives).</p><p><strong>Pronunciation Guidance</strong>: Learn the fundamental pronunciation rules for consonants, short/long vowels, and vowel combinations to improve your pronunciation quickly.</p><p><strong>Dutch Cultural Insights</strong>: Gain a deeper understanding of Dutch culture and society, as well as how Dutch people communicate with one another, to better connect with the language and its speakers.<br><br><strong>Common European Framework of Reference</strong>:&nbsp;Covering CEFR levels: A1 to A2, with an introduction to B1, this course provides a foundation for basic communication in everyday situations.</p><p><strong>12-Week Study Plan</strong>: Our guided study plan helps you learn these words in just 12 weeks. You can adjust the pace according to your available time and language learning speed.</p><p><strong>Dutch Vocabulary E-book</strong>: This course includes an e-book, an excellent supplementary resource for the video course that also serves as a study guide and memorization tool.</p><p>So, are you ready to embark on your journey to Dutch fluency? Join our Dutch Vocabulary Mastery online course today, and unlock your potential to communicate effectively in this beautiful language. </p><p>Don't wait any longer—sign up now, and let's get started!</p><p>I hope to see you soon,</p><p><em>Ramon Janssen</em></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Master the essentials of the Romanian language and use it in conversation.</p><p>Everything you learn as part of this course, you get to apply in the real world. The course includes practice rounds that will help you assimilate what you are learning through situational exercises. No more of the non-sense of ‘I know words, but can’t use them’!</p><p>This course is a great option for busy people and for efficient learners and assumes that the student is at the beginning stages of learning the language.</p><p>You are not asked to memorise words, but to apply what you’ve learnt IMMEDIATELY as part of the lecture. There are additional resources up for grabs, but you have everything you need in video format. We all learn differently and if you don’t know what these symbols mean i: ɜ: ɔ: u: ɑ: well, YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE NOT ALONE. So don’t worry about having to pick up complicated techniques just to make it through the course and to tickle the teachers’ pride.</p><p>Q: How about any grammar?</p><p>A: We will try to keep away from convoluted grammar explanations. If we do have to explain something in grammar terms, you shall be warned! There is no risk of you to be feeling deflated if grammar learning is not your jam.</p><p>The straightforward teaching approach is meant to leave you feeling good about yourself at the end of each lecture. You will be able to build on the previous knowledge and measure progress. We will take every opportunity to give ourselves a tap on the shoulder and take a victory lap.</p><p>LISTEN - REPEAT - PRACTICE</p><p>You've got this!</p>",

  "description": "<p>The whole of the German language can be broken down into several different structures. If you take any sentence from any German book or any utterance, you will see that it fits into one of these structures.</p><p>I remember one weekend, I was writing some lessons for the week ahead, when I suddenly realised this. I noticed that there are a certain number of structures in German, and that every sentence follows one of these structures. I spent the rest of the weekend working out all the structures, and I wrote them all down.</p><p>Every structure you learn gives you the ability to say a huge amount. Some structures are used more than others, but all the structures together make up the whole German language. Once you’ve learnt how a structure works, all you have to do is insert different words into the slots and you have a sentence.</p><p>This course introduces you to structure 1. I’ve limited each course to one structure so as not to overburden you. By looking at just one structure at a time, you can really get to grips with it and understand its usage. It will help to clarify the German language and make it more like a reflex rather than something you have to think about as is it were a maths equation.</p><p>Each structure can also help to propel you to fluency; if you can manipulate the structures at high speed, you can start to say anything you want without having to thing about how to say it.</p><p>This course contains plenty of practice opportunities for you to revise what you’ve learnt and it also contains some hints and tips on how best to learn and memorise the structures and the vocabulary that goes with them. You’ll learn how to make questions out of structure 1, how to make statements and how to turn positive statements negative.</p><p>The Building Structures in German series is set out using the same learning techniques as the 3 Minute German courses. You can work through the course in three minute chunks, enabling anybody to learn German, no matter how little time you have.</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>This English&nbsp;learning course has four main parts. Using correct English <em>memorizing, English reading</em> and English <em>listening</em> methods&nbsp;will result in a higher level of English <em>speaking fluency</em>, so we will look at these different skills in detail,&nbsp;one by one:</p><p>1) <strong>Memorizing English Vocabulary Effectively</strong></p><p>The first part focuses on memorizing English vocabulary in a real way. A lot of students have a habit of translating between English and their first language too much&nbsp;when they read or listen to English vocabulary. I believe that this results in English vocabulary that is very easy to forget. The 'meaning connection' is very weak when only using translation to understand meaning. So when students try and speak in English, the words don't come out very quickly, and the student needs to <em>search</em> hard for the English vocabulary.&nbsp;In this section I talk about methods which you can use to create really deep, strong, natural connections and meanings for English vocabulary, without relying on translating so much,&nbsp;which makes remembering the English vocabulary when speaking much, much easier. This is English vocabulary which is harder to forget, just like the vocabulary of your first language.&nbsp;</p><p>2) <strong>English Reading Fluency Strategies</strong></p><p>The second section focuses on English reading strategies. For building English vocabulary, some students like to create flash cards, or study English vocabulary lists, or just rely on reading English grammar books or English text books. In this section I will explain how using some different&nbsp;reading strategies and different types of English content&nbsp;can help you to build your English vocabulary in a much more effective and natural&nbsp;way. The 'memorizing English vocabulary' technique should be used with these English reading strategies together for the best results. I also talk about some ideas and&nbsp;resources that you can use to find the best English reading material, depending on your level of reading fluency in English. Gaining a high level of&nbsp;reading fluency is hugely important before&nbsp;moving onto English listening and speaking fluency, because it's the easiest and most logical to achieve first.&nbsp;</p><p>3) <strong>English</strong> <strong>Listening Fluency Strategies</strong></p><p>Just like reading in English, developing&nbsp;English listening fluency&nbsp;is&nbsp;hugely important&nbsp;for building a large English vocabulary, but it can be done the wrong way (mentally translating everything when listening) or it can be done the right way (the natural way of listening). I talk about how to you can improve your English listening fluency by using certain learning methods, and I talk about some English learning resources/websites etc where you can find great English listening content. English listening content that you will naturally be interested in. That is English listening content for beginners, but also&nbsp;English listening content for intermediate and advanced English learners as well. English listening fluency is one of those skills that can really effect your English speaking fluency because listening skills are so important for social situations in English and understanding what is going on in the conversation before you want to speak. But these English listening skills can be improved by yourself at home as well.</p><p>4)<strong> English Speaking Fluency Strategies</strong></p><p>And to finish off this English learning course, I'll talk about English speaking fluency methods. Speaking in English, especially in groups where everyone is trying to speak&nbsp;English at the same time, where you need a high level of English listening fluency so that you can understand everything, is the hardest English skill to master, as it also&nbsp;produces the most amount of anxiety for students. In this section I talk about&nbsp;finding good situations to practice speaking English, and some English learning websites for finding great English teachers to practice speaking with.&nbsp;I'll also talk about a method which I use in my online&nbsp;English Skype lessons to boost my students' English speaking fluency by turning their&nbsp;\"passive\" English vocabulary into \"active\" English vocabulary using a very specific method which surprisingly isn't used by a lot of English teachers. I'll also describe&nbsp;an English speaking exercise&nbsp;which you can use at home by yourself, without paying for an English teacher,&nbsp;which can improve your English speaking skills. You won't have an English teacher to correct your mistakes, but it's free to use! And lastly I'll talk a little about how this method can be used to improve your English writing skills as well, and then I'll discuss the idea of moving to an English speaking country, and some of the bad habits that you should avoid when learning English, and some good English learning habits that you should try to develop.</p><p>If you have any questions about English fluency or improving your English memorizing, English reading, English listening or English speaking skills, please feel free to send me a message and we can have a chat about which ever English learning topic you would like to talk about.&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy the course and I hope your English fluency improves!</p>",

The best way to learn is by example, and that is the foundation of this course. In each lesson, we will talk about one English phrase or expression. I will carefully explain the meaning, background, and usage(s), then share real-life examples from conversations between native English speakers.</p><p>You won't<em> just</em> learn English idioms in this course, you will master them, and <strong>understand how to use them in your daily life, </strong>which is important for exams like IELTS and TOEFL. Also, if you feel uncertain about anything you're learning throughout the course, I will answer any questions you have.&nbsp; In each lesson, use the examples given as a foundation for your own examples. Learning English should not be input only. Output is even more important. So, dedicate time to practicing on your own so that you can master each expression as a habit and use it without thinking. </p><p>Are you ready to take your English mastery to the next level? Let the journey begin!</p><p>-Luke</p>",

  "description": "<p><br></p>\n\n<p>I've spent 5 years studying people who taught themselves over 10 languages and this is the conclusion I arrived at:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\"You can learn a language on your own and in your home country in 6 months.\"</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course I'm going to share with you the method, practical tips and hacks typically used by those super language learners. I have applied them myself and I successfully learned to speak 7 languages rapidly. Inspired by their methods I set out to help others by compiling my research into this intensive course. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is specifically designed to make you speak any language as fast as possible. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The method consists of two main components.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The first one is a synthetic speaking activity in which you learn by mimicking the native speakers. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In the second part you deconstruct the language in a very efficient manner described in the course.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is designed for anyone, regardless of experience level. Whether you have experience in language learning or not, at the end of this course you will be able to successfully learn a foreign language on your own. You just need to be open-minded and willing to experiment new techniques. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You don't need to be talented. You don't need to have a special language learning gene. With the right mindset, the method and the techniques in this course you can achieve fluency in the next 6 months. Enjoy your language learning journey!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>The fact is, written English and spoken English are very different</strong>. It’s probably the reason you’re here looking at this course. You may also be wondering, “What is the best way to learn spoken English?”</p><p>If you want to master real native English expressions, you have to learn by example, and that’s the focus of this course. In each lesson of this course, we will carefully go over the most common <strong>daily American English expressions that native English speakers use when talking with each other</strong>. Here’s the lesson structure:</p><ol><li><p>Learn the correct pronunciation of the expression</p></li><li><p>Understand the meaning and background</p></li><li><p>Learn the various uses and meanings of the expression</p></li><li><p>Look at real-life examples, in context</p></li></ol><p>You will be able to deeply understand each expression and also <strong>learn how to use it in your daily life!</strong></p><p>You won't<em> just</em> learn English idioms in this course, you’ll master them, which is important for exams like IELTS and TOEFL. If you feel uncertain about anything you're learning through the course, I will answer any questions you have. </p><p>In each lesson, use the examples given as a foundation for your own examples. Learning English should not be input only. Output is even more important. So, dedicate time to practicing on your own so that you can master each expression as a habit and use it without thinking. </p><p>I hope to see you in the first lesson!</p><p>-Luke</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong><em>Marhaba (Hello and welcome)!</em></strong></p><p>My name is Nezha, and welcome to Arabic 4 U! </p><p><br></p><p>Before I talk to you about the course, please read what this student said about it:</p><p>This course is a great beginning to basic Arabic conversation in both MSA and as generic a dialect as you'll find. There are no lengthy lists of related vocabulary words and bizarre sentences like you'll find in many other courses. Instead, there are common conversational topics and short stories. You'll also find detailed instruction with plenty of repetition and reasonable pauses for you to repeat the material. The best part is that, wherever appropriate, there are multiple lines of color-coded translations: Arabic (with a focus on the proper Arabic script) and two English translations, including one with a verbatim translation. This shows a true understanding of language learning on the instructor's part as this method allows the student to learn not only new words but also a new way of thinking as most English-speakers will need to learn to structure ideas in a completely new way. I started the course earlier than I was ready as I had not yet learned how to read in Arabic well enough to get the most out of this course. By the time I returned to it, it had been updated and more great content had been added. Whenever I've had a question, I've received a helpful and respectful answer. I would highly recommend this course if you can read Arabic and are ready to start learning basic sentences. شكراً جزيلاً يا نزهة</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>After taking this online Arabic language course, you will start to:</strong></p><ol><li><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Speak Arabic with Arabic speakers from around the world</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Understand Formal Arabic called Modern Standard Arabic MSA or Fusha</p><p> Arabic speakers learn Modern Standard Arabic in school. </p><p>It is used in Arabic books, Arabic news, Arabic documentaries, Arabic road signs, and Arabic formal speeches.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Make sentences in the Arabic language on your own</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>&nbsp;Speak the version of the Arabic language called \"White Dialect of Arabic\" that Arabic speakers from different countries speak and understand.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>&nbsp; Understand Arabic Grammar and Arabic Conjugation.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Understanding Arabic grammar and Arabic conjugation will allow you to learn Arabic quickly.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong></p></li></ol><p>The <strong>biggest mistakes you may make as an Arabic </strong>learner are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Not getting the ROAD MAP or the GPS for your Arabic learning journey</strong></p><p>This mistake will make you waste a lot of time and energy in addition to feeling frustrated just like when you get lost on the road</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This Arabic course will help you avoid all of that by giving you: </p><ul><li><p>A clear road map and GPS so you don't waste time and energy and get frustrated</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Every step you need to succeed in learning Arabic so you can speak Arabic confidently and fluently in a short period of time</p></li><li><p>Tips that help you speak Arabic with Arabic speakers from around the world</p></li></ul><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Learning the non spoken formal Arabic and trying to use it to speak with Arabic speakers</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most Arabic courses teach you the non spoken formal Arabic called Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)or \"Fushaa\" in its pure form. Pure Modern Standard Arabic is what Arabic speakers learn in school. It is used in Arabic books, Arabic news, documentaries, and Arabic formal speeches. It is not spoken in its pure form.</p><p><br></p><p>However, Arabic speakers use a CONVERTED version of Modern Standard Arabic to communicate with each other when they do not speak the same dialect or if they want to target all Arabic countries.</p><p>Since they were no formulas or techniques that teach Arabic learners how to convert Pure Modern Standard Arabic into spoken Arabic, I decided to develop and create these formulas and techniques for my private Arabic students. </p><p><br></p><p>During my 20+ years working as an Arabic linguist, teacher, translator, and interpreter, I researched the way Arabic speakers convert Modern Standard Arabic into Spoken Arabic and created these formulas and techniques.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>In this Arabic course, I will share these formulas and techniques with you. I will teach you:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Pure Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) </strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How to convert this non spoken formal Arabic (MSA) into Spoken Arabic</strong></p><p><br></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Learning Arabic words and Arabic phrases here and there without learning how the Arabic language works</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; By learning Arabic in an unorganized way, you will never master any topic.

  "description": "<p>This course is designed for anyone who is preparing for IELTS and aiming for a band score of 7+, providing<strong> 'IELTS-specific' grammar help </strong>for IELTS takers. </p>\n\n<p>Grammar is one of the four marking criteria for writing and speaking sections, and a key component to understand and get the right answers in listening and reading sections. Therefore, this course focuses on some of <strong>the most essential elements of grammar to help you score better in all sections of the IELTS test</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course is, however, not a comprehensive, exhaustive reference to English grammar. Rather, this course deals with <strong>common grammar mistakes IELTS takers make </strong>and provides a clear explanation about the grammar elements to help you avoid making the same mistakes in your exam. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>All you need to do is to <strong>follow three simple steps for each grammar element</strong>: Detect errors -Learn why it's wrong and how to make it right -Confirm your understanding through exercise questions. If you aim for a higher score and feel like your weak grammar prevents you from getting the score you want, this course can be the solution you've been looking for. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Don't waste your time studying less relevant aspects of grammar when you need to get a score of 7+ ASAP. Be IELTS specific, <strong>strengthen your grammar in the most important areas, and achieve your target score </strong>with this course.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n\n<br></div>",
