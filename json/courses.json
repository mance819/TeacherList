  "description": "<p>Most of the signals around us, in the world we live in are not digital in nature, rather they are analog. The digital systems can understand only digital signals, not analog. Hence, it becomes important to interface the digital systems we the external analog world. The analog input signals are to be converted to digital signals using Analog to Digital Converters at the input end of the digital system. After the processing by the system, the digital signals are to be converted back into analog signals using Digital to Analog Converters.</p><p>A n-bit Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) takes a n-bit digital word and converts it into a proportional analog voltage with respect to the reference voltage. The potentiometric DAC uses the concept of Voltage Divider. In an N-bit DAC, the analog voltage range, i.e. the Vref (here 3.3 V) is equally divided into 2^N voltage values. This is achieved by a series on 2^N equal resistors and taps are provided across each R. The combination of switches to tap the values is designed using the N-bit digital word as input.</p><p>This circuit was designed using eSim</p><p><strong>eSim</strong> (previously known as Oscad / FreeEDA) is a free/libre and opensource EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis and PCB design. It is an integrated tool built using free/libre and opensource software such as KiCad, Ngspice and GHDL. eSim is released under GPL.</p><p>eSim offers similar capabilities and ease of use as any equivalent proprietary software for schematic creation, simulation and PCB design, without having to pay a huge amount of money to procure licenses. Hence it can be an affordable alternative to educational institutions and SMEs. It can serve as an alternative to commercially available/licensed software tools like OrCAD, Xpedition and HSPICE.</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Right from ordering food to booking flights to even finding a partner, we use in-numerous apps and websites on a daily basis. Some of these apps and websites are intuitive and easy to use <strong> </strong>while others are horrible and frustrating.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong><em>So what differentiates a good app or a website from a bad one?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Although there can be multiple factors responsible for this, but Usability is definitely one of them.</strong> Usability means providing users with the ability to achieve their goal with minimal efforts in least possible time. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good usability leads to:</strong></p><p><em>1. Better Conversion Rates</em></p><p><em>2. Improved Customer Retention</em></p><p><em>3. Reduced Support Costs</em></p><p><em>4. Increased Productivity and </em></p><p><em>5. Greater User Satisfaction.</em></p><p><br></p><p>Now as we know the importance of usability, the million dollar question here is how to evaluate usability<strong> </strong>and not just evaluate but how to improve usability of an app or a website. </p><p><strong>If you are also wondering about these questions, then you have come to the right place. </strong></p><p>I am Aman Gupta, your instructor for this course. <strong>I have been studying and implementing UX design principles for the last 12 years</strong>.<strong> </strong>I have specifically created this course to help you understand usability and the ways to evaluate usability of any user interface. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who should take this course?</strong></p><p>Whether you are <strong>a designer, developer, product manager or a startup founder</strong> this course would really prove beneficial to you. <strong> </strong>This course will teach you practical guidelines that you will be able to use immediately in your job to create world class products and interfaces. I can confidently say that by the end of this course you will be able to evaluate a website or an app for its usability and not just evaluate you would be able to provide suggestions to improve its usability. </p><p>Additionally, for designers and product managers who are looking for new career opportunities, this course is really worth a shot. Generally as a part of the recruitment process for these profiles, companies ask applicants to review a product and provide suggestions for improvements in the same.<strong> </strong>And I can assure you that the framework and techniques discussed in this course will really come in handy to ace these product review assignments. Although there are different sets of guidelines available for evaluating the usability of an app or a website, but in this course we would be primarily discussing the 10 Usability Heuristics given by Jakob Nielsen, as these are the most widely used guidelines across the world to evaluate any user interface. </p><p>With the help of real world examples, I will walk you through how these usability heuristics can be used to evaluate any user interface.</p><p>You would agree that the best way to learn is by getting your hands dirty. Therefore this course will not be limited to theory only, and will provide multiple exercise files and interfaces for you to work on. As a usability expert, you will be evaluating these interfaces and highlighting usability issues in them. Further, I will also be sharing my Usability findings for these products and user interfaces so that you can see how you performed.</p><p>So, does this all sound exciting to you? If yes I invite you to join this course and embark on this enthralling journey towards a better and an upskilled you. I welcome you all and hope to see you in the class!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Let’s be honest: most people never figure out how to make their living room feel right.</p><p><br></p><p>You try rearranging furniture. You scroll for inspiration. You buy a rug or lamp that looked good online – and it still doesn’t work.</p><p><br></p><p>You know something’s off, but you can’t put your finger on it. The space doesn’t feel like home. You hesitate to invite people over. And every time you walk in, it nags at you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>This course fixes all of that – in a few focused hours.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I’m Assel Baimakhan – interior designer with 18+ years of experience, 1,000+ global projects, and 1,700+ students taught. My work’s been featured in Forbes, Architectural Digest, and L'Officiel.</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, I’ll walk you through the exact step-by-step system I use to design living rooms for real clients. It’s the same framework I’ve used to turn hundreds of cold, chaotic spaces into warm, functional, photo-worthy homes.</p><p><br></p><p><em>No fluff. No theory. Just results.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You’ll Learn How To:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>- Follow my 10-step layout-to-decor process that works every time</p><p>- Stop wasting money on the wrong furniture, colors, or accessories</p><p>- Make smart, confident design choices – this isn’t just an expense, it’s the smartest investment you can make in your space and your peace of mind</p><p>- Use lighting and layout tricks to instantly upgrade the entire feel of the room</p><p>- Design around limitations (renting, awkward spaces, weird architecture)</p><p>- Layer in color, texture, and detail for that polished, high-end look</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why This Course Works (When Everything Else Hasn’t):</strong></p><p><br></p><p>- <strong>No guesswork</strong> – you’ll see exactly what to do, in what order, and why</p><p>- <strong>No overwhelm</strong> – the process is broken down into short, manageable lessons</p><p>- <strong>No risk</strong> – you can try it 100% risk-free, and if you don’t love the results, walk away with your money back</p><p><br></p><p>If you hired a professional interior designer for your living room, you’d easily spend <strong>$500 to $2,000+</strong> just for the consultation. This course gives you that same transformation blueprint — for a fraction of the cost.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You’ll also get:</strong></p><p>- 17 downloadables (layouts, checklists, templates)</p><p>- Homestyler 3D training to visualize before you buy anything</p><p>- Lifetime access so you can reuse it in your next space, too</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What Students Say (from over 1,700 total students across all platforms):</strong></p><p><br></p><p>&gt; <em>“This course made me feel like I had a designer in my corner.”</em> – Marta&nbsp; </p><p>&gt; <em>“Now people ask who styled my living room. I tell them: me.”</em> – Sofia&nbsp; </p><p>&gt; <em>“It used to stress me out. Now it’s my favorite room.”</em> – Lena</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who This Is For:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>- You rent or live in a small space but want something that <em>feels</em> high-end</p><p>- You’ve tried to fix your living room but nothing seems to work</p><p>- You want your space to feel intentional, not accidental</p><p>- You’re tired of wasting time on YouTube and Pinterest hoping something clicks</p><p>- You want to take control of your home and create something you’re proud to live in</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zero Risk, Instant Access:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If you don’t feel a difference the next time you walk into your living room – if it doesn’t feel clearer, calmer, better – get your money back. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>No waiting. No email chains. Just a refund.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You’re not just buying a course. You’re stepping into a new standard. A more put-together version of you. The kind of person whose space reflects confidence, taste, and control.</p><p><br></p><p>And here’s the truth: every week you wait is another week living in a room that doesn’t feel right.</p><p><br></p><p>Start now. Fix it now. Feel the difference in just a few days.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Click “Enroll” and start the transformation in the next 5 minutes.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There’s no downside. Only a better room on the other side.</p>",

Through more than 100 videos, the tutorial walks through the entire process of building a stunningly looking house from scratch to final render inside of Unreal Engine 5.</p><p>Through a divide and conquer approach, the students will learn how to build pillars, doors, windows, and stairs first as Houdini Digital Assets (HDAs), and move on to tackle different body part of the house, from body to roof, decks, and pavements while utilizing the HDAs to construct the final form. In the process, students learn critical knowledge of 3D mathematical concepts including dot and cross product, matrix, and quaternion. The mathematical/geometrical meaning, and various operations of these mathematical terms are explained in dedicated sessions and their usage in spatial calculations and polygon manipulations are practiced.</p><p>The VEX scripting language is taught thoroughly in dedicated sessions and used to aid the house build process. Students learn fundamental programming concepts including variables, containers, flow control, and functions first, and will be able to leverage the power of scripting to express their ideas directly and effectively in Houdini.</p><p>Finally the tutorial leads to the Houdini Engine integration with Unreal Engine 5, allowing students to import their HDAs directly into Unreal Engine, and connect materials and assets automatically, providing a complete solution to the end product.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Character Design and Illustration: The Summoner. Join me as I walk you through my method of character design and illustration using Adobe Illustrator. I spent over 10 years developing the style of illustration using the most robust vector software on the market. You will learn exactly how I approach my character design and illustration as if you're over my shoulder watching me in a real-life studio setting. My approach to character design is very modular, and allows for many different types of genres and design types. So whatever, kind of project you're working on this demo will get you on the right track.</p>\n\n<p>The techniques I'm using in this video series can be carried over into many other painting and drawing applications. The methods  I'm using are partial to Adobe Illustrator. This video will focus primarily on how to digital paint in the broadest sense so we can apply the knowledge to any other process as we see fit.<br></p>\n\n<p>Digital painting and cell shading in Adobe Illustrator allows you to adapt your character designs for many uses and sizes. Since vectors are scalable and do not pixelate when resized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just imagine the implications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In this course, you will learn:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>how to get started inking in Adobe Illustrator</li><li>how to color flats in Adobe Illustrator</li><li>dynamic lighting techniques</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Enroll today!</p>\n\n<p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong></p><p>Welcome to the <strong>Game Environment Masterclass 2020 </strong>with <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>! This course is packed with <strong>expert insight</strong>, <strong>technical skills, secret tips, </strong>and the <strong>black arts </strong>of environment design that will help you level up your environment design and art skills to a whole new level! All Packed into a <strong>compact 45 hours of content </strong>that would be impossible to get anywhere else.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong></p><p><br>In this course, we will create a professional, next-gen-game environment using <strong>state of the art tools</strong> and resources</p><p>Here are few of the main points we’ll cover in this course:</p><p>- How to <strong>properly </strong>use <strong>Megascans </strong>and <strong>Unreal Engine</strong> <strong>4 </strong>to create <strong>ray traced </strong>game environments</p><p>- Use <strong>tiled textures </strong>from Megascans to create <strong>modular pieces</strong> or custom pieces. We will make around 35-40 custom pieces using <strong>3Dsmax</strong> and I will show you how, step-by-step.</p><p>- Setup a wide variety of <strong>advanced shaders </strong>in Unreal Engine 4</p><p>- Learn how to make every portion of the environment <strong>blend </strong>together very well to create a single seamless world</p><p>- How to properly use and reuse <strong>decals</strong></p><p>- Using <strong>foliage </strong>to enhance the scene look by placing them in a smart way.</p><p>- Create <strong>custom masks </strong>for things like window glass using <strong>Substance Painter</strong></p><p>- Learn how to customise Megascans <strong>PBR textures </strong>to make them more usable and to suit your environment</p><p>- How to enhance and carry out <strong>storytelling </strong>through your level design</p><p>- How to fake <strong>destroyed assets</strong> such as ruins of buildings and walls</p><p>- Use Unreal Engine’s <strong>Blueprints </strong>system<strong> </strong>to create <strong>splines tools </strong>that support both instancing and procedural meshes.</p><p>- Make sure the Blueprints tools we created are <strong>extensible </strong>and <strong>artist-friendly</strong></p><p>- We will cover a bit of <strong>VFX </strong>and their shaders to help bring the scene to life</p><p>- Lighting is key to bring everything together and create truly beautiful worlds. You will learn how to beautifully light your scene and present it in the best possible way. You will also learn how to optimise <strong>lightning </strong>alongside <strong>ray tracing </strong>and <strong>post-process </strong>effects</p><p><strong>- AND MUCH, MUCH MORE</strong> ... <br><br>The best way to describe this course is: <strong>become a one-man army</strong>. It’s <strong>not for beginners</strong> as I won’t cover the basics but if you’ve got a handle on artist tools then get strapped-in for quite the ride! There are <strong>no time lapse </strong>sequences<strong> </strong>and no <strong>pre-planned segments</strong>. Students will be able to follow me live <strong>digging my way to the end. </strong>I’ll be <strong>showing </strong>and <strong>explaining every little step </strong>along the way, allowing you to follow along in real-time or watch at your leisure.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHO THIS COURSE IS FOR:</strong></p><p>Intermediate game artists, level designers, game developers, or game designers</p><p>Unreal Engine users</p><p>Intermediate artists who want to learn game environment design</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>In this intermediate level tutorial we will be focusing on the process of creating a creature that could be used in the Games Industry. Starting from a simple concept, we will create a base mesh for our creature, move into sculpting, and finish with Retopology and UV layout. The tutorial focuses heavily on sculpting fundamentals in ZBrush, as well as the necessary tools to create a game resolution mesh using Maya. By the end of the module you will have a game resolution character ready for the texturing process.</p><p><strong>(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)</strong></p><p><strong>More about the Instructor:</strong></p><p>An adopted son of San Francisco and the Academy of Art University, Ryan Ribot lives a small apartment with 3 cats and a Wacom. Currently working as a texture artist and character modeler with Telltale Games, Ryan spends most of his time painting and sculpting. ZBrush, Photoshop, and Maya are like breathing to him, and he is always looking to share his knowledge. Ryan has been teaching for several years, and is experienced as both an instructor and an industry professional.</p>",

  "description": "<p>The first step in passive solar design process is to determine solar access for a building and site. This will help designers determine strategies to control daylight and heat gain. Shading mask diagrams are very resourceful tools to determine solar access. This course will equip you to read and create shading masks so that you can use them in your design process.</p><p>A shading mask is a representation of the sky as viewed from a reference point, indicating the portion of sky that is visible and obstructed. Access to sky means access to daylight. When combined with a sunpath diagram, solar access can be determined. This makes the shading mask diagram a nifty tool for designing passive solar buildings. Additional data such as solar insolation, relative humidity etc can further be overlapped on the sunpath diagram making this a very interesting design tool. This course will ensure you have a thorough understanding of the concept of shading mask and equip you to read the diagram.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Further, the course includes a tutorial that shows how you can create a simple DIY shading mask kit inorder to create diagrams on your own. Software that can be used to create shading mask is also shared.&nbsp; </p><p>A separate module on the application of shading mask as design tool walks you through some of ways this tool can be used. Design decisions such as the size of shading devices, the right orientation of buildings, identification of the location for solar renewable systems, determining the height of building forms at a master plan level and many others can be informed using this simple tool.</p><p>This course is designed in a highly engaging content giving you a learning experience that’s comprehensive and fun at the same time. By the end of the course, you’ll be ready to use shading masks in your design process.&nbsp;</p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you ready to <strong>unlock the full potential of 3ds Max</strong>, and learn to model any advanced objects you can imagine? Poly modeling is the key, and this course will give you the foundation you need to do it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN?</strong></p><p>In this course you will start with a basic introduction to poly modeling tools and principles, but that won't take long. We will quickly jump in to start creating unique projects, and learn by doing. Projects will start out simple and continue to more advanced.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHY LEARN POLY MODELING?</strong></p><p>Poly modeling is an extremely powerful tool within the world of 3d graphics. It gives an artist the capability to create any kind of form they can imagine -- from simple, to highly intricate and organic. For many things that 3d artists will wish to create, it is the best and sometimes only way to go.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LEARN FROM A PRO</strong></p><p>Hi, my name is Adam Zollinger and I have been teaching on Udemy for about 8 years. I&nbsp;have about 100,000 students worldwide and teach on the subject of 3d graphics, having 20 years of professional experience in that field.</p><p>Specifically, I am an architectural visualization artist (arch viz) so a lot of the poly modeling is done from that perspective, but the skills translate to all aspects of 3d, and these techniques can be used to create any kind of object, whether for architecture or sci-fi, etc.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>HOW IS THE COURSE STRUCTURED?</strong></p><p>In this course, students can start with a basic introduction to the principles of poly modeling. If this is too basic, students are encouraged to jump right into the projects. To start, there are 3 different projects (ranging from easy to advanced), with each project building new skills and using new tools and techniques to build your foundation in poly modeling. By the end, students will be modeling a photo realistic piece of furniture to add to their library of assets. We will also discuss UVW unwrapping in the advanced project, so students will understand how to setup their models for custom materials.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>JOIN NOW</strong></p><p>If you are interested in learning a new 3d skill, or enhancing your existing ones, I hope you will join me in the course. Here are some points on why you should join this course:</p><ul><li><p>Myself and my teacher's assistant will be around in the Q&amp;A section to address questions and help you along your way. </p></li><li><p>Poly modeling is such a great way to \"level up\" your arch viz or other 3d projects. </p></li><li><p>Once you unlock this skill, the only limit on what you can model using 3ds Max is your imagination. </p></li><li><p>I designed this course to cut through all the mysterious stuff, and give the essentials</p></li></ul><p>So, if you are ready to jump into poly modeling right away, join now!</p><p>Can't wait to see you in class!</p><p><br></p><p>*Keep in mind that a purchase gets you lifetime access to the course. You will gain access to all lectures on-demand right away, and also have access to any future lectures added to the course</p><p>**30 day money back guarantee: If you are not satisfied, I&nbsp;understand. Just request your money back through Udemy. It is easy to get a refund anytime within 30 days of purchase.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Learn amazing and easy-to-follow skin tone coloring techniques from a professional artist. <br>Lisa Mitrokhin - painter, illustrator, author, YouTuber, and instructor - is here to teach you all of her secrets on coloring pale, olive and dark skin tones. All you need to play along is paper, colored pencils (of any brand), and your enthusiasm. </p><p>Research shows us that human beings respond to human faces a lot stronger and more positively than to anything else, followed only by dogs, cats and sunsets. <br>That means that using portraits in your art, whether it's drawing, painting, or coloring, will make your work more likely to be noticed and admired.</p><p><br>This course is structured in three parts, with short (5 to 15 minute) lessons designed for you to follow at your own pace. Lisa starts the course with pale skin tones, moves on to olive skin, and completes the journey with dark skin tones. <br>Wether you're a colorist, a drawing student, or an accomplished artist, Lisa provides everything you need to follow along. Each skin tone comes with an original Lisa Mitrokhin digital painting, a grey-scale coloring page of the same character, and a sepia coloring page. Print out the coloring pages and color-along with her. </p><p><br>You will learn her color selection strategy, new and different shading techniques, the theory of skin tones coloring, and understand why certain colors appear the way that they do on skin. </p><p><br>After completing this course, you will be able to apply this theory and these techniques to any coloring or drawing. </p><p>Important note: this is NOT a portrait drawing course. This course focuses ONLy on skin tone coloring technique. You do not need to know how to draw to take this course. </p>",

You will learn about concepts that are applicable irrespective of the design language.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you have work experience as a designer and are interested in learning about sustainability, you will be able to quickly apply the concepts covered in this course in your practice. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have designed this course in short lectures covering each topic in a simple and easy to understand language. There are 5 lectures in this course with 1 hour of video content. I have included exercises and some simple calculations within the lectures to help you reinforce the concepts<br></p>\n\n<p>Towards the end, you will learn about a sustainability matrix that can be used as a decision making tool for selecting materials that has the best sustainability score.<br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Hi there, I’m Dan. In this course we’ll learn how to create and edit a video for our website. Then we’ll go and build the site from scratch. It looks fancy, but it’s not particularly hard. </p>\n\n<p>I built this course for beginners. You do not need to know how to code or how to edit video to take this class. We’ll start with the super basics. This could totally be your very first website, wouldn’t starting with a video background be a super cool first project?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll go through the full process. I’ll show you where to find some video, I’ll show you how to edit it in Premiere Pro. We’ll do cool video effects like blurs, tints and transitions. I’ll show you how to export the video so we can get the file size super small. Once we’ve created our video we’ll build a basic website together and make our video all cool and full screen. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll also create a second option where the video peeks in through a specific box.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course I’ve got exercise files so you can play along. I’ll also save my files as I go through each video so you can compare yours to mine - handy if something goes wrong. We’ll be using Dreamweaver &amp; Premiere Pro but 95% of this can be done in generic web &amp; video tools. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Remember</strong>: I’m happy to help &amp; I’m pretty handy with replying. Also - there is a handy cheat sheet you can print out. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The best thing - is that it’s not that hard. But a super awesome video background will impress the heck out of your clients. </p>",

Louay's courses are some the most well thought out, intelligently designed, and clearly structured for all levels of experience…<br>One of my favourite aspects of Louay's instructions is that, while engaging the students, he doesn't waste time with verbal nonsense. As a student you will not have your time wasted with poorly edited videos with audio content that has nothing to do with the course. But don't read that as Louay isn't engaging or lacking interest. It's the opposite. He wants his students to learn and achieve a higher skill set in After Effect.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Another top remark about Louay is that he is always there for his students.

  "description": "<p><strong>*First course on Udemy about CONTRACTOR SERVICES</strong></p><p>*In this course students will be familiar with the BIM services that Navisworks can provide for any BIM project. First, we will cover Navisworks workspace, how to control it and how to navigate through BIM model, then we will move to the Model Review process, we will learn more about the different sources of comments that we receive as contractors and how to review the models against those comments. The next topic which we are going to cover in this course is the Coordination. The coordination is one of the biggest challenges that we face as contractors on the construction site, so we will learn how to use navisworks to help us in the coordination process between different disciplines and how to sync these results with Revit models. Then we will learn how to create Material Takeoff reports to make the contractor orders based on the construction site activities. Then the activities will be linked with time and cost to create the 4D &amp; 5D Simulation. </p><p>Preparing (VOs) is one of the most important tasks that we make as contractors, we will discuss that topic as well. </p><p>At the end of this course you will learn how to create a very nice animation and rendering </p>",

  "description": "<p>This course is a series of lectures that I've put together with the sole purpose of creating an easy onboarding experience for anyone interested in improving their art skills. Many people, including me, have felt very lost when wanting to start improving their art. These lectures are meant to supply students with a smooth, straightforward baseline for where to start.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only will this course teach you many of the basic principles of what I personally consider to be the primary fundamentals of art, but I also share recommended resources that helped me along my journey as well as suggestions for assignments to do on your own time to help better understand each fundamental.</p><p><br></p><p>To ensure that this course is for you I've provided a long introductory video that will express everything I go through in the lectures as well as insight into the art industry.</p><p><br></p><p>The courses included go over the following information, which is a must for anyone interested in improving their artwork:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Anatomy:</strong> The study and practice of understanding the muscular and skeletal structures of an animal or human. If you've ever wanted to draw characters, creatures, portraits, cute chibi animals, anything really, anatomy is a must to have a basic understanding of. I discuss all of the general aspects of anatomy including gesture, proportions, perspective, construction, and exaggeration.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Values:</strong> These videos will go over how to see things without color and instead view things as if they were in greyscale. I offer various tips and valuable information as to why being able to identify thing within values is so important to image-making.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Color/Light:</strong> Color is so important to help capture emotion in your images. I help define basic terminology as well as discuss all the basic ins and outs of color theory and how colors can affect us psychologically. </p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Perspective:</strong> one of the most overlooked fundamentals of art is perspective, however it is one of the most important fundamentals. Everything we see in the world follows some form of perspective, it's how we translate what we perceive onto a flat 2-dimensional canvas. It's a hefty, complicated subject but I offer many tips and tricks and advice to help understand and simplify the knowledge so that you can get started.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Composition:</strong> Composition is how images are arranged, whether it's of a cool buff warrior guy or of a bunch of dots on a canvas. The order and positioning of shapes on the canvas plays a big part in how we perceive things and the way that it makes us feel when seeing images. It sounds very artsy and high brow, but I try my best to keep things approachable and offer easy solutions to get you to start practicing composition immediately.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Studying Techniques:</strong> At the end of every section I go over ways that you can start practicing these fundamentals right now. I also show my own personal progress and growth as an example of how effective these practices can be.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Music Credits in the videos: Dyalla, Bensound</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to <em> How to Draw Cartoon Dogs</em>! This is a course for beginners, kids, parents or anyone else who would like to learn cartooning. In this course I’ll be walking you step-by-step through my process to create seven cartoon dogs. By the end of this workshop you will have created a chihuahua, a German shepherd, a poodle, a basset hound, a pug, a bulldog and a sausage dog!\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>I’ll first show you the sketch phase, where I build up each dog with some basic shapes, then we’ll move on to inking in the dominant lines with a thick pen, followed by adding details with a thin pen. Finally we will get out some colored pencils and do some good old fashioned coloring in!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>With increasing scrutiny on buildings' sustainability performance and a rapid rise in demand for green buildings, building designers can no longer afford to ignore their impact on the environment and society.</strong> Clients, investors and regulators across the globe are increasingly demanding green buildings, <strong>however, there are so many different and contrasting approaches to Sustainable Architecture &amp; Building Design that it is difficult to understand where to begin.</strong></p><p>I strongly believe, if building designers are given the right tools, they can decide which of the various sustainable design approaches are right for their project. This course provides the<strong> foundations for understanding the key approaches to sustainable building design </strong>and allows architects to<strong> avoid paying expensive consultancy fees while increasing their market appeal.</strong></p><p>This course is split into 6 main sections, that is based on the standard Building Plan of Work:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Understanding what Sustainable Architecture and Building Design is and why it is vital to start adopting it. </p></li><li><p><strong>Pre-Design: </strong>Investigating the importance of Green Building Certifications, Community Engagement and Lifecycle Assessments (LCAs) and how your project can benefit from them before starting design. </p></li><li><p><strong>Design: </strong>Exploring Net Zero Carbon, Circular and Biophilic design approaches and how to implement in your project successfully. </p></li><li><p><strong>In-Use: </strong>Exploring Passive, Active and Water Conservation design approaches and how to implement in your project successfully. </p></li><li><p><strong>End of Life: </strong>Exploring Design for Reuse, Durability, Adaptability and Deconstruction design approaches and how to implement in your project successfully. </p></li><li><p><strong>Industry Case Studies: </strong>Consolidating the knowledge from the first 5 modules and looking at how Sustainable Building Design is implemented in industry with an interview with Managing Director of JKT Architecture. </p></li></ol><p>This course will prepare everyone from <strong>architectural students</strong>, looking to secure a job in the hugely growing green building market; <strong>sustainability and ESG professionals</strong> just starting out a career in the built environment and <strong>those who are managing their own home design and construction. </strong></p><p>By the end of this course, you will have a solid understand of why Sustainable Architecture and Building Design is so important and how to begin incorporating the principles in your own projects.

Check out part 1 if you haven't already done so. I created this series to make learning how to use After Effects as easy as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You learn by doing.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Dive Into After Effects series, you'll follow along and work on your own project while learning. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What makes me qualified to teach you?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Phil. I am a professional motion graphics artist and video creator. Plus, I'm the creator of some of the world's most popular After Effects courses - with over 150,000 students and thousands of 5-star reviews like these ones from this course:</p>\n\n<p><em>Exactly what I was looking for to get a quick and basic introduction to animating on AE. - Tudor Coaching Group</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Great job in presenting a lot of information in a short time - Dan Kardell<br></em></p>\n\n<p><em>Love this little course about Motion Graphics in After Effects. It's so precise and clean in the instructions an examples. - Bo</em><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>My Promise to You</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'll be here for you every step of the way. If you have any questions about the course content or anything related to this topic, you can always post a question in the course or send me a direct message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to make this the best course on learning After Effects for beginners. So if there is any way I can improve this course, just tell me and I'll make it happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What's this course all about?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Effects is an amazing program that can help you create motion graphics, visual effects, and titles that make your videos better, but it can be intimidating to try out. In this 60-minute course, you'll learn the magic of keyframes - the basis of creating motion graphics in After Effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You'll take the title card that you created in the first Dive into After Effects: Understanding the Basics course, and you'll introduce each element of your title card in a unique way. These include motion, scale, opacity, and rotation animations; trim path animations; and 3D transitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This class is perfect for video creators, designers, and everyone who wants to learn After Effects in an non-intimidating way. We recommend taking the Dive into After Effects: Understanding the Basics course first. By the end of the class, you'll have the basic knowledge to start animating graphics and dive even further into the world of After Effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ASSIGNMENT</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Animate a title card for your brand (or your favorite brand) within After Effects. This assignment will teach you how to use keyframes to introduce different elements (text, images, shapes) to the audience. If you are brand new to After Effects, take the first <u><strong>course</strong></u> in the Dive Into After Effects series to learn how to design your own title card directly within After Effects</p>\n\n<p><strong>With our 30-day 100% money back guarantee, there is nothing holding you back from jumping in right now and trying the course out.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phil</p>\n\n<p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you ready to make digital items you can sell online or give away as collateral to readers,  subscribers and followers? Are you ready to learn Illustrator in a practical way - actually making things?</p><p>Great! Welcome! This course is for you. It's a fun and a practical way to learn Illustrator and start building collections of assets you can monetize. These can be sold online to digital scrapbookers (digiscrapping), to designers for use in their design projects, for social media use and printables. </p><p>In this course, you \"learn by doing\" as you make a range of creative assets suitable for scrapbooking, digital projects and social media marketing purposes.  You will learn to make scrapbook papers, seamless repeating patterns, type elements, graphic photo overlays for social media, digital art, and much more. These designs can be sold on Etsy or other online market places, they can be uploaded to Spoonflower to make fabric and wallpaper, they can be used at print on demand sites as book covers and mugs, and can be sold as vector or bitmap stock images. There are so many ways to monetize the designs you'll make in this course.</p><p><strong>Who is your trainer?</strong></p><p>I'm Helen Bradley and I've taught thousands of students to use Illustrator and Photoshop. I don't fluff about and I'm focused on helping you learn to use Illustrator in a practical and smart way. My workflows are carefully structured for maximum success and I explain everything so you know the 'why' as well as the 'how' of any process. </p><p>I have a huge commitment to my students' learning - I answer all student questions and I often add extra videos to a course to help students with questions that others might also benefit from learning from.</p><p><strong>What will you learn?</strong></p><p>When you complete this course, you'll:   </p><ul><li><p>be able to create scrapbook papers, type elements and ancillary graphics in Illustrator</p></li><li><p>be able to color coordinate a collection of items</p></li><li><p>know how to package a product line for sale</p></li><li><p>have extended your knowledge of Illustrator tools</p></li><li><p>have learned new tips and techniques that you can use every day</p></li><li><p>be able to confidently create graphic assets for a range of design and commercial uses</p></li><li><p>have developed new graphic design skills and workflows</p></li></ul><p><strong>Do I hear you say \"...but I don't know how to use Illustrator (and frankly, I'm scared of it)\"?</strong></p><p>I understand!    </p><p>I've been there.</p><p>Illustrator can be really scary to use when you first start out.    </p><p>… but I've created a better way to learn Illustrator. One that makes it a lot less scary and a lot more fun.    </p><p>You see, you'll learn to make items you can sell, give away on your blog, and use yourself. So you'll be making designs that you can do something with at the same time that you are learning Illustrator. There's no waiting! There's no hours of learning before you can get started doing <em>something</em>. In fact you can start today. Complete the first few lessons and you'll have your first scrapbook paper made!     </p><p><strong>Do I hear you say \"... but I hate the Pen tool!\"?</strong></p><p>I understand! Most people hate the pen tool. You are not alone!</p><p>… I believe that Illustrator is so much more than its (dreaded) Pen tool – so we'll use the pen tool only when we have to (which is practically never) and you'll see just how much you can achieve without it.     </p><p><strong>Do I hear you say \"... but I can't draw\"?</strong></p><p>No problem! If you can use a mouse you can complete this course. </p><p>Quite simply, you don't need to be able to draw. In fact many designers can't draw and yet they make fantastic designs and great products. </p><p>If you <em>can </em>draw – great! If you can't draw – don't worry, you'll be able to do succeed in this course even if drawing isn't a skill you have mastered.  In those sections of the course where you learn to digitize hand drawn sketches I will give you some of my sketches you can work with so you can master the skills even if you don't  yet have drawings you can use.</p><p><strong>Are you ready to extend your Illustrator skills?</strong></p><p>If you already know the basics of using Illustrator, taking this class will elevate your skills to a new level. You'll learn to use tools and techniques in a practical situation. No laboriously making shapes just to learn what the pathfinder tool does. No! In this class you'll learn the pathfinder because you need it, you'll draw shapes intrinsic to the design you are making - you'll be putting your skills to practical use from the first lecture. You'll reinforce your existing knowledge as you apply it to real world designs. And if we use tools you've never used before - great! You'll learn to use them fast and easily so you understand how you can put them to work in your daily workflow.     </p><p><strong>Do I hear you say \"Please don't waste my time\"?</strong></p><p>If there is one thing I hate it’s wasting time and you probably do too. </p><p>So, I don't say \"um\", I don't fluff about, I don't make mistakes, I know my stuff and I show you how to do things efficiently and effectively. I speed up the videos where appropriate so you don't get bored or distracted. </p><p>I'm 100% focused on helping you learn.    </p><p>In short, I'll get straight to the point and I’ll maximize what you learn in every class.    </p><p><strong>Do I hear you say \"... but I can't afford the latest Illustrator version\"?</strong></p><p>Again, I understand. I teach thousands of students who can't afford the monthly Creative Cloud payment. If you're using practically any version of Illustrator you should be able to complete most of this course.  That said, a small number of the designs we'll make require the use of the Pattern Make tool which was introduced in Illustrator CS6 (and which is in Illustrator CC). So, if you are using Illustrator CS5, or earlier you may want to skip those sections.</p><p><strong>Will I just learn to make things?</strong></p><p>Well Yes, and No! </p><p>Yes, you'll learn to make all sorts of creative assets, but you'll also learn to use tools such as the Transform tools and Type tools and you'll learn techniques and tips for working everyday in Illustrator.</p><p>You'll get plenty of practice using Illustrator and you'll grow in confidence with every lecture.</p><p><strong>How will I learn?</strong></p><p>This course is made up 100% of video content. You'll watch my screen as I show you how each design is made. I'll explain what I am doing and why so you can learn as you watch. At the end of each section is an optional assignment you can do to test and reinforce your learning.</p><p><strong>Join me... </strong></p><p>I hope you will join me in this Illustrator class. I look forward to meeting you and I invite you to contact me if you have any questions as you work through the lectures.  </p><p>cheers!</p><p>Helen</p>",

  "description": "<p>The subject of Composition and Design is broad and there are a variety of compositional tools that have been used over time to emphasize ideas, stories, and religious thought.&nbsp;</p><p>In this course we will focus primarily on two areas: Notan, which deals with light and dark and the visual structure, and&nbsp;the very flexible tool of <strong>Rebatement</strong>,&nbsp;which works with the&nbsp;underlying architectural&nbsp;structure.&nbsp;Much is said about Dynamic Symmetry and how it helps in designing your work. <strong>Rebatement is a variation on Dynamic Symmetry</strong>. Dynamic Symmetry is based on a mathmatical 'root' system. Because that system is somewhat fixed, the ratio of your work and canvas size must also be fixed to stay within the structure of dynamic symmetry. Rebatement is a MUCH more flexible variation on dynamic symmetry as you won't be bound by the fixed ratios of heights to widths. The Golden Section as well as the Rule of Thirds is based on Rebatement. <strong>Some people call this the magic grid.</strong> Magic, because it so quickly helps to design a pleasing composition. <strong>It can be used for portraiture, plein air, still life painting, abstract painting as well as photographers.</strong></p><p>Using images from master artists,&nbsp;as well as some of my work, we will analyze why a painting works and what&nbsp;tools were used to&nbsp;create&nbsp;these vivid works of art.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, you will learn how to use both Notan and the variation of Dynamic Symmetry, Rebatement, to <strong>create strong and visually pleasing works that will read across a room.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In addition, I will teach you how to make your own rebatment viewfinders that you can use&nbsp;in your studio and in the field.&nbsp;</p><p>This class is useful for any visual artist as well as for any lover of the arts.</p>",

It is used for&nbsp; movies, for games and for both characters and environment. And you maybe want&nbsp; to see what is it all about? Then this course is probably right for you. </p><p><br></p><p>My name is Niko, and i am a character artist for more than a decade now. In this course i will show you how to start working with Substance painter and make a nice good looking textures for your models by making a metal armour, horns, gold inlays and gowing eyes for our knight model here.&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>In this course we will learn:</p><p><br></p><p>Exporting the high poly meshes from Zbrush</p><p>Exporting the low poly mesh from 3dsMax</p><p>Basics of Substance painter</p><p>Importing the meshes in to Substance painter</p><p>How to bake the textures in Substance painter</p><p>Making metal armor material</p><p>Playing with dust and scratches </p><p>Making fabric material</p><p>Making emissive glowing eyes</p><p>Exporting textures for UE4</p><p>Importing the model and textures in Marmoset Toolbag</p><p>Learn all about Marmoset Toolbag</p><p>Rendering our model in Marmoset with lights and making a turntable</p><p><br></p><p>As a bonus and for strenghtening our skills in Substance painter and Marmoset toolbag we will make a realistic female head and realistic hand, baking and texturing.&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>We will start with naming and exporting our high poly meshes from Zbrush. Then we will also name properly and export our low poly mesh from 3dsMax. After that we will open Substance painter and we will get to know the basic menus and tools. Then we will import our low and high poly and learn how to bake textures in Substance painter. When the baking is done, we will start adding layers and folders to achieve the nice metal armor and cape fabric materials. We will also learn how to experiment with dust and edge wear. We will then learn how to add an emissive channel and make the eyes glow. Then we will paint manually on our model a custom gold decoration for his armor. After we are happy with our texture, we will learn how to export textures from Substance painter with different presets, and we will use the Unreal Engine 4 one.</p><p><br></p><p> Then we will open Marmoset toolbag and we will learn the basic menu layout and what to do in the program. After that we will import our model and textures in Marmoset, and make a proper material there. Next we will add some lights and&nbsp; go trough all menus, to make different adjustments and make sure we have the best possible render. We will also learn how to make a turntable video in Marmoset. </p><p><br></p><p>As a bonus and for solidifying our knowledge of Substance painter and Marmoset toolbag, we will repeat the procedure again with a female head and a realistic hand. </p><p><br></p><p>I have created this course for absolute Substance Painter beginners, so no previous knowledge of either Substance painter or Marmoset Toolbag is required. All the files you will need to go trough this course are provided in the Project files folder so you don't need any other software&nbsp; if you only want to learn Substance painter and Marmoset Toolbag. So let's get started! </p>",

You will learn how the course is structured and how it benefits you as the learner. This section introduces the blender interface and how to use all of the navigation and selection tools that are required to learn to become a 3D modelling artist.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Modelling</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In this section, we go over the topic that blender is best at, 3D modelling. Here, you will learn how to create 3D Models either from scratch or by using one of blenders pre installed primitive objects. We will learn how to use object mode to change our objects properties (such as size and scale) in relation to the world around it, and edit mode which focuses on changing the actual shape and form of the object. We will be using all of the core modelling techniques for our designs and introducing many of blenders modifier tools which can be used to enhance our creations.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Texture and materials</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In this section, we cover how to apply different materials and textures to the models that have been created. Textures are used to change the visual appearance of our mesh by mapping colours and patterns onto its surfaces. Materials are used to determine how our object will react to any light sources that hit it. Applying your materials correctly can make your object look identical to its real world counterpart. We will be using two of blenders rendering engines in this section. The blender render engine creates basic textures suitable for exporting models into other software platforms such as unity or unreal engine. Cycles render is an engine used to create the best materials and textures possible for creating beautiful rendered scenes and animations, but is less optimized for exporting, especially to game engines.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Rigging</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>This section focuses on the pre production stage of animations, which is the rigging of objects in your scene. Rigging is the creation of a skeleton or armature that is used to help move models in ways similar to their real world counterparts. For example an armature for a human model would allow us to control the model at the joints like puppet strings, allowing us to move our model in the same way that our bodies do in real life. We will go over how to construct a full rig with skeleton bones, control and ik bones, and the weight painting tool which will allow us to change the influence of each bone on our model.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Animation</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In this section of the course, we bring our creations to life by learning how to create animations by using tools such as the timeline, Graph editor and dope sheet. We will learn about keyframes and you can use these to create your animations the quick and easy way while with the help of the graph editor and dope sheet you can change where these keyframes are used in your animation and how the keyframes interact with each other, giving you complete control other your animations. This section will also go over how to render images and animations so that you can add them to your own portfolio of work. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Exporting</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The basic does and don'ts of successfully exporting your creations to other software platforms such as unity 5.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THIS COURSE IS SUBJECT TO 30 DAY MONEY GARUNTEE, WHERE IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY WITH ANYTHING ABOUT THE COURSE YOU CAN ALWAYS GET YOUR MONEY BACK.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THIS COURSE IS ALSO SUBJECT TO BAILY COURSE 'IMPROVING FOR THE COMMUNITY SCHEME'. IF THEIR IS A TOPIC THAT STUDENTS WOULD LIKE COVERED IN THE COURSE, THEN WE WILL EITHER LOOK TO INCLUDE IT IN THE COURSE WITH THE NEXT COURSE UPDATE OR ADD IT TO A FUTURE COURSE.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>",

In fact, you will see how fun it can be. </strong></p><p style=\"\">Why do so many people shake in fear at the thought of trying to learn Photoshop. I know it is a huge program, but the truth is you only ever end up using certain things. In this course I will show you exactly what use every day and leave out all of the fat.</p><p style=\"\">Photoshop has been around for a long time. And while it is constantly innovating and making our lives easier, Adobe very rarely takes out the parts that don&#039;t work anymore. It&#039;s understandable. Many designers don&#039;t want to relearn the program every year. So Photoshop has become kind of like a hoarder. Full of a lot of junk that it just can&#039;t bring itself to throw away.</p><p style=\"\">Another important thing to understand. Most online classes want to be thorough. They think they have to each you every single tool and effect and walk through step by boring step explaining how to use tools that nobody uses anymore. </p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Why is this course different?</strong><br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\">I&#039;m not here to teach you all of Photoshop. To be honest, I don&#039;t know anyone who knows everything you can do with Photoshop. The program updates so much that you can either work as a Graphic Designer, or spend all your time learning what&#039;s new.</p><p style=\"\">If your goal is to become a graphic designer, this is a very good first step. If your goal is simply to open Photoshop documents and know where to go...this is also the course for you.</p><p style=\"\">If you have been working with Photoshop for a while and want an advanced class...this isn&#039;t the course for you. However we do cover some topics that are considered advanced. I just consider them cool...or really good to know.</p><p style=\"\">Give me just an hour and I swear you will never be afraid of Photoshop again!<br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\">After we get up to speed with Photoshop, it&#039;s time to learn how to make some dough! </p><p style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">I will show you some of my favorite techniques to find new clients.</strong></p><p style=\"\">We begin with a quick hour of training. Then, using the tools from the training I will show you a few key skills that I use to generate income. After that I will show you some ways to find clients. Here&#039;s one of the keys, you don&#039;t want to try and find jobs where everyone else is. So forget Elance and other job boards. I&#039;ll show you what actually works. </p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">As I add more to this class the price will go up. So I recommend you get in early. Once you buy this class you will be in for life. So it could go well over a few hundred dollars, but you may have only paid $59. </strong><br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">In this course we will learn the following:</strong></p><ol style=\"\"><li style=\"\">The 3 Most Important Parts of Photoshop CC</li><li style=\"\">The Secrets to the Layers Panel</li><li style=\"\">The most important tools and how they work.</li><li style=\"\">The one quick skill that can bring you tons of income. </li><li style=\"\">My favorite tricks</li><li style=\"\">How to find clients today!</li></ol><p style=\"\">If you are not 100% satisfied that this course is worth the price you paid, I will give you a full refund. <br style=\"\"></p><p><br style=\"\"></p>",

By completing the course, you will be able to build vast sewer networks and individual rooms on various levels including intricate chairs and doors that open using a third-person character.</p><p>You will be creating variations of walls, stairs, and sewer network parts to build a game environment unique to every student. Finally, optimize your modular system parts ready to export them into Unreal Engine 5.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Following the success of my latest courses, we will be modelling, texturing, and finalizing every individual asset before moving on to the next. Students have said that this has helped them in staying excited throughout the creation process, being able to see how their scene comes closer to the course preview step-by-step.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, you could set yourself a challenge and diversify aspects of the medieval dungeon such as changing the textures, adding more rooms, or adding furniture assets to make your medieval dungeon more alive.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Texturing and Materials</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>‘Blender 3 to Unreal Engine 5 Dungeon Modular Kitbash’ </strong>will provide you with intensive learning all in one place, giving you access to over 16 references, 1 medieval dungeon floor plan, 32 custom cliff brushes, 1 HDRI, 55 Blender texture maps -including ambient occlusion, metalic, normal, roughness and specular, 33 Unreal Engine 5 texture maps – including base colour, normal, and combined ambient occlusion / metalic / roughness, 1 human scale .obj, 90 dungeon modular parts (in case you choose to move straight into Unreal Engine 5), and Unreal Engine 5 content such as the lava texture, water texture, waterfall animation sheet, and skybox.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The node wrangler is one of the best free built-in addons within Blender but most users are not even aware of it. This course will teach you how to create your materials, find out how to take all of those beautiful texture maps and make use of them.</p><p>Creating your materials or altering textures on the fly is something you will want to learn about. Maximising your knowledge of Blender’s node system will raise the level of your textures and skill up your skill in working with materials.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Unreal Engine 5: Game Engine Integration</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Continue your modelling to game engine journey by completing the second (independent) part of the course in Unreal Engine 5. We will be taking a deep dive into Epic’s all new Unreal Engine 5.</p><p><br></p><p>Through <strong>‘Blender 3 to Unreal Engine 5 Dungeon Modular Kitbash’ </strong>you will be learning everything right from importing individual models from Blender to having them work correctly in UE5. Through this course, you will learn the basics of bringing your games asset to life, rendered in real time.</p><p>Learn how to open a game door using blueprint coding, custom collisions, and all about the Niagara fire systems to create particle effects. Work towards setting up your dungeon ready for walking through with your very own third-person character in Unreal Engine 5.</p><p>Create animated stylized fire and lighting, including braziers, and flaming torches. Build a real game environment by setting up an 8k skybox and animated lava material to feature underneath your medieval dungeon.</p><p><br></p><p>We will look at how to import and use textures created specifically for Unreal Engine and use them to create the materials for our medieval dungeon environment. <strong>‘Blender 3 to Unreal Engine 5 Dungeon Modular Kitbash’ </strong>will also be an introduction into how to set up files to create a clean UI. The skills you learn here are fully transferable to all your future builds.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lighting &amp; Rendering</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>When we look at renders of 3D models on social media, we can see a huge difference between models of different artists.

This way it is possible to accelerate the product creation process, dramatically reduce costs connected with reiteration and testing and have full control over your idea design. I estimated these saving - and personally experienced them - to be between 8k and 20k depending on the app scope",
    "This course is meant for DESIGNERS who want to transition from Photoshop, Illustrator or Fireworks",
    "This course is meant to be PRACTICAL and to provide you with the TOOLS needed to start crafting a real app, icon or website. If you are looking for a course about DESIGN PRINCIPLES - E.G. how to choose the right colour combinations or proper fonts for your app - then this is NOT the course for you. In case you are a beginner, I personally suggest that you start with this course and later on refine your designs studying those kind of principles. It is more fun and more intuitive."

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the <strong>Complete Guide to Dynamic Paint in Blender</strong>. In this class you will learn everything there is to know about Dynamic Paint and how it works. It was also created for all skill levels. So whether you are a complete beginner or an intermediate Blender user, this class is for you! Not many people know about Dynamic Paint or how it works, so that is why I created this class where more can learn about this amazing modifier and create their own animations!</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>What is Dynamic Paint?</em></strong></p><p>Dynamic paint is a modifier and physics system that can turn objects into paint canvases and brushes. Doing this allows you to create vertex colors, image sequences or displacement. This makes effects like footsteps in the snow, raindrops and paint that sticks to walls very easy to create!</p><p><br></p><p>In the first couple sections we will discuss all of the different settings and values and how they change how the simulation works. You will see side by side comparisons so it's easy to understand exactly what is happening. A variety of other topics also covered include adding dynamic paint to materials, creating footprints in the snow, paint drying effects and much more.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the best ways to learn is to create something yourself, so that is why I have included 3 tutorials in which we use Dynamic Paint to create some high quality animations.</p><p>The first one is about creating an abstract displacement effect. You will learn how to export an image sequence from Dynamic Paint and use that for the displacement. Then to top it off you will be creating a glowing material.</p><p><br></p><p>The 2nd tutorial is about creating a disintegrating fire effect. This tutorial will cover many topics including: fire simulations, dynamic weight painting, proximity brushes and fire materials.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally the last tutorial will be about creating a seamless rain drop animation. For this one we use particles and dynamic waves to learn how to make the animation seamless so it can loop over and over again.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are looking to learn about Dynamic Paint and how it all works in Blender this is the class for you! So hit that enrollment button and let's get started! I look forward to seeing what you create!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><em>Thanks,</em></p><p>Stephen</p>",

  "description": "<p>Have you ever wondered how those <strong>awesome interactive books and apps for the iPad and Kindle</strong> are made? Or even better, have you ever wanted to get a story or an idea you've had into an eBook format, but have absolutely no clue of where to start?!</p>\n\n<p>Well, have I got news for you! I can show you how <strong>you can create a simple children's interactive ebook</strong> in as little as a week, or even a weekend! We can even show you how to<strong> get your eBooks on the Apple, or Google App store!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine that you can publish <strong>an eBook for the iPad that can “read aloud\"</strong>, and has a Drag and Drop game, or even has a coloring book! All of this is possible <strong>without having to write a single line of code!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this short course, we can show you that <strong>bringing your eBook idea to a reality is possible</strong>, even if you've never published a physical, or digital book before!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to children's eBooks, some of the best interactive, or <strong>Enhanced eBooks are put out by large companies like Disney</strong>, Sesame Street, or Mattel. We teach you how you can <strong>get the same level</strong> of interactivity, and <strong>without breaking the bank!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So, <strong>SIGN UP for our course</strong>, and let us show you how to get your stories from <strong>out of your head, and into an eBook</strong> for the iPads &amp; Kindles of the world!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>About 2 years ago, I was watching my little girl reading along and playing games with an eBook on the Kindle. With all of the sounds and animations, it reminded me of the interactive CD-Roms I used to create in the 90’s—and how cool would it be to make eBooks for my daughter! So, I wondered, what software were they using to create these eBooks &amp; apps, and could I learn and teach it? After months of searching, and some trial and error, I came up with a way to make my own interactive eBooks… but, it was far more complicated than I wanted. The problem was it involved several programs, as well as writing and tweaking code.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Then I found it, an eBook publishing solution that handled EVERYTHING, and I didn't have to write a single line of code! This software does all the heavy lifting on the back-end, and leaves your mind free to create your masterpiece!</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Actually, this software is so simple, I can even teach you the basics in just over 30 minutes!</em></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong><em>Instructor Info</em></strong></p><p>Emiel Sleegers always had love for video games and when he was young, he started using Unity3D for programming but he found himself gravitating more towards the art of making games. Now he is currently working as an environment artist in Ubisoft. He contributed to creating AAA games such as Forza Horizon 3 and The Division 2. His all time favorite game is The Last of Us and that video game is what inspired him to want to work in the game industry. His advice for beginner artists is to focus on one aspect of gaming that they are passionate about, stick to it and get better at it. His hobbies include anything related to games or films, whether it be working on personal projects, freelance work or going out for movies. </p><p><strong><em>Course Info</em></strong> </p><p>In this course, we will go over the entire process of how to create a Japanese Alley game environment. We will first start out with a blockout of the scene to achieve a proper sense of scale, and once that is done, we will go back to the blockout to 3d modeling the buildings. We will do a high poly to low poly workflow where we will create a high res and low res model and bake normal maps for them. We will go through the process of how to make the environment look realistic, how to use weighted vertex normals, and how to do smart, quick and clean unwrapping of uvs. Then we will jump into Substance Designer to create tilable textures such as metal, concrete, and tarmac. We will touch up on Substance Painter and little bit of Photoshop to texture our props. Once everything is modeled and textured, we will import everything in Unreal to setup our materials and lighting for a nice final render.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n\n<p>According to <em>Techcrunch</em> recent article in June 2016, Virtual Reality (VR) is the next big thing. Facebook also made the bold move to acquire Occulus Rift, which is a company that designs VR headsets, for a staggering $2 billion. All data indicate that VR is the next big wave of change in the Media landscape. We've witnessed an exponential growth in availability of apps in the decade following commercial production of tablets and smart mobile phones. We can foresee that in the next decade, innovation in VR will also grow exponentially and websites will have a VR version that will allow users to view from their mobile devices+headset. As the hardware is currently getting more popular and sales are on the rise, there will be a demand for VR online applications. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Content </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong>The course was designed to teach the students about the latest technology for developing VR websites and the easiest way to make a start in designing such websites. The easiest technology that a developer or a newbie to use to make VR websites is the A-frame, developed by Mozilla. Although this technology is at an early stage, it is slowly gaining popularity. But it would require more developers to use it and build websites with the technology in order to further develop a systematic design methodology.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The first section is about using A-Frame and building on various tags to give the student to knowledge and skills to understand and use varioius objects on a VR scene. In the next sections , you will learn simple animations and use of cursors. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This will be followed by lectures on how to use Javascript and PHP with A-frame.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course ends with simple projects such a Multicolored bubbles, Interactive Hotel rooms view and VR shopping page.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong><em>Corazon Bryant</em></strong><em> </em>always had an artistic bone in her body. When she was only 2 years old, she would make detailed drawings on her mother's wall. Her mother loved the drawings so much, she decided to keep them. With the encouragement of her mother, she continued drawing and she only got better as time went by. When Corazon was in middle and high school, she earned money making portraits for her classmates and even for her teachers. She pursued a college degree in Media Arts &amp; Animation and later worked for architectural and entertainment companies such as Camm Productions, ID DI Design, and PDT International. She also had an opportunity to do some freelance work for Mega Pickle Entertainment. While working as a 3D artist, she had a chance to teach 3D animation classes in an A+ school. This is when she found her true love - which is not only to talk about 3D endlessly but to also inspire greatness in young upcoming artists. Corazon is currently working on a new project called Victory 3D with fellow industry-experienced artists to provide an affordable and effective learning system that will make it easier for students to get a job in the 3D industry.</p><p><strong><em>Course Info</em></strong></p><p>Have you been looking for a course that shows you how to make a realistic full body character, sculpt likeness, retopologize, unwrap, texture, and render all in one place? Then look no further. This course is for you. In this course, I will take you through the process of creating a beautiful female character and make it production-ready for films and animations.</p><p>The main topics we will be covering are:<br><br>-Sculpting a female character from head to toe <br>-Sculpting believable clothing <br>-Variety of retopology methods for movie characters <br>-Full body UDIM workflow <br>-Marvelous to Maya Retopology and UV creation <br>-Industry techniques for painting detailed textures <br>-Realistic skin shader, metal &amp; cloth materials <br>-Creating realistic hair in Xgen<br>-High quality lighting and rendering using Arnold</p><p>Before starting this course, you should have a basic understanding of Zbrush, Maya, and Photoshop. No knowledge of Wrap, Marvelous Designer and Mari is needed as I will teach you the basics of these programs.</p><p>In this comprehensive course, we will begin by working on our female face and body using Zbrush. I will go over the major forms that you need to know to be able to produce a realistic female character. We will create details such as skin pores and tiny wrinkles to bring life to our character. We will learn about different ways of retopologizing our character, using automatic retopology and manual retopology using Wrap and Maya. We will generate our UV map for our character using the UDIM workflow. I will go over what UDIMs are, and why they are important when it comes to creating high resolution textures. You will learn how to simulate clothing using Marvelous Designer. We will then take our clothes in Maya to retopologize them to create a clean mesh, and then back into Zbrush to create major folds, minor folds, and memory folds. We will use Mari to hand paint our skin from scratch. I will show you exactly how to make different types of maps such as color map, specular map, and sss map step by step. We will create real world shaders such as silk, metal, and skin and we will go through the process of learning how to connect our maps properly. Then we move on to creating our hair using Zbrush and Maya. We will create our main hair using Fibermesh, then we go inside Maya to make Nhair for our braids that we will then use for our Xgen hair. We will create realistic eyebrows, eyelashes and peachfuzz all using one of the most powerful tools in Maya called Xgen. Last, I will show you how to create a nice clean render using Arnold and do some postwork in Photoshop to further enhance our image.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be able to create your own amazing female character that is fully ready for production.</p><p>If you are ready to challenge yourself and get out of your comfort zone to be a great artist, then it’s time for you to sign up for this course. There are no limitations on what you can be, have or do, as you are the master of your artistic journey. Make today the day that you take action, come and join this course at Victory3D.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong><em>Instructor Info</em></strong></p><p>Emiel Sleegers always had love for video games and when he was young, he started using Unity3D for programming but he found himself gravitating more towards the art of making games. Now he is currently working as an environment artist in Ubisoft. He contributed to creating AAA games such as Forza Horizon 3 and The Division 2. His all time favorite game is The Last of Us and that video game is what inspired him to want to work in the game industry. His advice for beginner artists is to focus on one aspect of gaming that they are passionate about, stick to it and get better at it. His hobbies include anything related to games or films, whether it be working on personal projects, freelance work or going out for movies. </p><p><strong><em>Course Info</em></strong> </p><p>In this course, we will go through the process of creating an amazing Victorian style game environment! We will start off by modeling the ornate pieces inside 3ds Max and then take them in Zbrush to enhance them. We will then model our modular pieces such as the pillars, the doors, the roof, the floor, etc. for reusing them in Unreal Game Engine. We will use Substance Designer to create a variety of tileable textures such as wood, plaster, gold, and fabric. We will explore different types of techniques such as high poly to low poly modeling and weight normal to low poly modeling to create our props in our scene. We will also utilize Marvelous Designer to create realistic cloth and drapery that will further solidify our environment. We will jump into Substance Painter to texture our props and once everything is looking good, we will setup our models and materials in the game engine. We will dive in creating lights and post fx that will set the mood for the overall Victorian Era game environment.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This comprehensive course offers a thorough exploration of <strong>Zemax Sequential Mode</strong>, providing participants with a systematic understanding of lens design, optical system analysis, and surface property management. Structured to align with real-world optical engineering needs, this course introduces foundational concepts before progressing to advanced design techniques, supported by a practical, hands-on approach.</p><p>The course begins with an in-depth examination of the <strong>Zemax environment</strong>, ensuring participants develop a strong understanding of the interface and its core functions. You will learn to navigate the Zemax workspace, set up optical systems, configure system data, and import lens prescriptions. Essential topics such as <strong>system explorers</strong> and the implementation of optical surfaces are covered in detail, along with methods for extracting and utilizing commercial lens specifications. Foundational techniques like <strong>thickness solves</strong>, paraxial focus, lens layout, and input ray setup provide the groundwork for building precise optical systems.</p><p>Moving beyond singlet lenses, the course introduces <strong>doublet lens design</strong> as a practical example. You will explore the concept of doublets, apply first-order equations to these systems, and import them into Zemax for analysis. Through this example, you will learn to evaluate the <strong>first-order properties of real lenses</strong>, including virtual image formation and key performance characteristics. This section provides an ideal bridge between theoretical optics and practical implementation.</p><p>In the <strong>Curvature Solves</strong> section, participants will develop the ability to control and optimize lens curvature using advanced tools. Topics include <strong>fixing and varying curvature values</strong>, effective focal length (EFFL), marginal ray angles, pick-up solves, and calculations for element power and F-number. Additionally, the course covers <strong>thickness solving</strong>, where you will study marginal ray height, edge thickness, positional constraints, and center of curvature considerations for precision lens systems.</p><p>The program further explores <strong>Material Solves</strong>, where you will learn how to model and substitute materials efficiently to achieve desired optical performance. In conjunction, the <strong>Clear Semi-Diameter</strong> section introduces automatic and maximum aperture settings to refine optical designs. Mastery of these tools will enable participants to solve complex lens challenges with confidence.</p><p>An essential part of the course focuses on the <strong>Lens Data Editor Toolbar</strong>, a powerful resource for fine-tuning optical elements. This section teaches how to automate lens updates, introduce tilt and decenter elements, add fold mirrors, reverse optical elements, and configure <strong>apertures</strong>. Participants will learn to implement double-pass configurations and other practical techniques critical to optical simulations.</p><p>The <strong>Surface Properties</strong> module delves into the visual and functional aspects of optical surfaces. Topics include surface coloring, opacity adjustments, row customization, and the creation of surface stops. Advanced surface tools such as “Ignore This Surface,” <strong>surface property drawing</strong>, aperture editing, and tilt/decenter configurations are also explored, ensuring participants gain full control over surface design.</p><p>The course culminates with <strong>Practical Examples</strong>, allowing participants to apply their knowledge through real-world lens systems. You will analyze and design both <strong>Triplet Lenses</strong> and <strong>Cook Triplets</strong>, following a step-by-step process of explanation and solution implementation in Zemax. These exercises solidify key concepts, reinforce problem-solving techniques, and prepare participants for independent design work. We also explore the design and analysis of the <strong>Maksutov Telescope</strong>, offering participants a deeper understanding of more complex optical systems and their integration in Zemax.</p><p>By the end of this course, participants will have gained mastery in setting up, designing, and analyzing optical systems within Zemax Sequential. This program is ideal for optical engineers, researchers, and professionals seeking to develop their expertise in Zemax and optical system design. Whether you are building singlet lenses, doublets, or complex optical assemblies, this course provides the tools and techniques needed to excel in optical engineering applications.</p>",

  "description": "<p>I wish I could convey to you the feeling I get when I hold a physical object in my hand<br>that was conceived in my mind a few hours prior. Human beings were designed with<br>an innate desire to create, invent, and solve problems, and 3D printing technology allows us to experience this in an amazingly unique way. Possibly you have witnessed a 3D printer working its magic as it seemingly created something out of nothing. In order for 3D printers to work, there must first be a carefully designed 3D model that the printer can use. In less than four hours, you can become the designer, creating your own quality, custom, print-ready models!</p>\n\n<p>In this course, you will follow along with step-by-step lessons that guide you through<br>the process of creating print-ready 3D models with the amazing SketchUp Make<br>software. After teaching many different CAD software packages over the<br>past 12 years, the SketchUp Make software was chosen for this course because of its ease of use for beginners and its relatively low learning curve. I have had students as young as age 10, as well as adult learners, successfully create complex models in a very short period of time with these free 3D modeling tools. My teaching methods<br>allow you to explore the use of the tools in a way that you will feel confident in branching out to create your own custom models fast.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After exploring the main drawing tools in SketchUp, you will tackle projects where you create your own customized models such as nameplates, key/luggage tags, and custom USB flash drives. You will learn to identify and avoid problems such as overhangs that cause serious issues with many 3D models, leading to print failure. You will convert your files to the correct format for most 3D printers, and will be given information and advice on where to get your files printed. I'm excited to help you get started with this amazing technology, and can't wait to see the amazing<br>products you will design!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Krita</strong> is a graphics application that is comparable to <strong>Photoshop</strong>. But, unlike Photoshop, Krita is <strong>free</strong> and <strong>open source</strong>. So you can download and use it without having to pay anything. Another thing that makes Krita different from Photoshop is that Krita focuses more on <strong>digital painting</strong>. So you will find many digital painting or drawing features in Krita that are not available in Photoshop. If you need software to draw or create illustrations, then Krita will make you feel right at home.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to master Krita <strong>quickly</strong> and <strong>easily</strong>, then -in sha Allah- this <strong>online course</strong> is the best solution for you. However, you should be aware that this online course is designed as a continuation of the previously released <strong>basic</strong> and <strong>intermediate</strong> Krita courses. So to be on the safe side, make sure you take those courses first before taking this one.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What will you learn?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>As a macro overview, I have divided this online course into <strong>8 chapters</strong>, apart from the introductory chapter. In the first chapter, you will learn about various <strong>transformation</strong> and <strong>distortion</strong> techniques. Such as \"Perspective\", \"Warp\", \"Cage\", \"Liquify\", \"Mesh\", and so on. Then, in chapter two, you will learn advanced <strong>layer features</strong>, namely \"layer style\", \"clone layer\", \"file layer\", and \"fill layer\". Next, in chapter 3, you will learn various techniques related to <strong>pattern</strong> and <strong>texture</strong> creation. You will use various pattern generators such as \"multigrid\", \"Screentone', \"SeExpr\", and so on. Then learn to create repeating patterns using the \"wrap around mode\". Then, in chapter four, we will discuss the \"<strong>Photobashing</strong>\" technique. It is basically a technique of utilizing photos or external images to speed up the illustration process. Chapter 5 is the first big <strong>project</strong> chapter. Here you will learn to create an illustration of a <strong>deep-sea diver</strong> looking for treasure. You will learn the process in detail, from A to Z. In chapter 6, you will learn the ins and outs of the <strong>brush system</strong> in Krita. From the types of brush engines, sensors, to how to create your own brush presets and brush tips. With these, you will be able to create unique brush presets, such as creating sea plants or anemones on the fly, creating a rope in one stroke, creating a grass field in seconds, using plants that you design yourself, and so on. In chapter 7, you will learn <strong>painterly style</strong> drawing techniques, or digital illustrations that look like they were created with real brushes. In this chapter, you will also learn various \"<strong>cheating</strong>\" techniques. They are techniques that can help you create illustrations even faster. In chapter 8 or the last chapter, you will utilize everything you learned from the previous chapters to create an illustration of a <strong>cowboy cactus</strong>. The main challenge of this project is to create a painterly style illustration as <strong>quickly</strong> as possible. But also as <strong>flexible</strong> as possible, so that it's still easy if we have to make future revisions to the drawing.</p><p><br></p><p>So <strong>join now</strong>! And upgrade your Krita skills to the fullest potential.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Adobe Illustrator Advanced Pattern Techniques - Masterclass - extend your Illustrator knowledge by making useful designs</strong><br></p><p>Are you ready to make more advanced and complex patterns in Illustrator? Do you want to extend your knowledge of Illustrator? Do you want to expand your surface pattern design and graphic design skills? </p><p>Great!&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Welcome!&nbsp;</p><p>This course is for you. It's a&nbsp;fun and a practical way of becoming more competent in using Illustrator.&nbsp;</p><p>Here you'll \"learn by doing\" as you make a range of advanced and more complex seamless repeating patterns. You can use these patterns for saleable creative assets, scrapbook papers, stock imagery, backgrounds, and for your own projects. Upload them to Spoonflower to make fabric and wallpaper, and print them on book covers and mugs. There are literally hundreds of ways to make use of the patterns you'll make in this course and you'll be so&nbsp;proud when&nbsp;you say \"I made that\".</p><p><strong>Who is your trainer?</strong></p><p>Helen Bradley has taught thousands of students to use Illustrator and Photoshop. She doesn't fluff about and is focused on helping you learn to use Illustrator in a practical and smart way. Her workflows are carefully structured for maximum success and she explains everything so you know the 'why' as well as the 'how' of any process. </p><p>Helen has a huge commitment to her students' learning - she answers all student questions and often adds extra videos to a course to help students with questions that others might also benefit from learning from.</p><p><strong>What will you learn?</strong></p><p>When you complete this course,&nbsp;you'll:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be able to create a range of advanced types and styles of seamless repeating patterns in Illustrator</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have extended your knowledge of Illustrator tools&nbsp;</p><p>- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have learned&nbsp;new tips and techniques that you can use every day&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do I hear you say \"...I struggle a bit when using Illustrator (frankly, I'm even a bit scared of it)\"?</strong></p><p>I understand!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I've been there.</p><p>Illustrator can be really scary and a bit intimidating to use.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>… but I've created a better way to learn Illustrator. One that makes it a lot less scary and a lot more fun.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>You see, you'll learn to make patterns&nbsp;you can sell, give away on your blog, and use yourself. So you'll be making designs that you can do something with at the same time that you are extending your Illustrator knowledge. There's no waiting! There's no hours of learning before you can get started doing <em>something</em>. In fact you can start today. Complete the first few lessons and you'll have your first patterns made!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Do I hear you say \"... but&nbsp;I hate the Pen tool!\"?</strong></p><p>I understand! Most people hate the pen tool. You are not alone!</p><p>… I believe that Illustrator is so much more than its (dreaded) Pen tool – so we'll use the pen tool only when we have to (which is practically never) and you'll see just how much you can achieve without it.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Do I hear you say \"... but&nbsp;I can't draw\"?</strong></p><p>No problem! If you can use a mouse you can complete&nbsp;this course. </p><p>Quite simply, you don't need to be able to draw. In fact many designers can't draw and yet they make fantastic designs and great products.&nbsp;</p><p>If you <em>can </em>draw – great! If you can't draw&nbsp;– don't worry, you'll be able to do succeed in this course even if drawing isn't a skill you have mastered.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Are you ready to extend your Illustrator skills?</strong></p><p>I'm assuming you already know the basics of using Illustrator.&nbsp;So, in taking this class you will elevate your skills to a new level. You'll learn to use tools and techniques in a practical situation so you use what you're learning instantly. You'll reinforce your existing knowledge as you apply it to real world designs. And if we use tools you've&nbsp;never used before&nbsp;-&nbsp;great! You'll learn to use them fast and easily so you understand how you can put them to work in your daily workflow.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Do I hear you say \"Please don't&nbsp;waste my&nbsp;time\"?</strong></p><p>If there is one thing I hate it’s wasting time and you probably do too.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I don't say \"um\", I don't fluff about,&nbsp;I don't make mistakes, I know my stuff and I show you how to do things efficiently and effectively. I speed up the videos where appropriate so you don't get bored or distracted.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm 100%&nbsp;focused on helping you learn.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, I'll get straight to the point and I’ll maximize what you learn in every lecture. </p><p><strong>Will I just learn to make patterns?</strong></p><p>Well Yes, and No!&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, you'll learn to make patterns – lots of wonderful seamless repeating patterns. Each pattern has been chosen for a reason. There are the plaid and Ikat patterns which mimic the look of fabric effects, and there are geometric, and organic patterns. Each uses different techniques so you extend your knowledge of Illustrator as you complete your designs. &nbsp;</p><p>But along the way you'll also learn to use tools and effects like Filters, the Wrinkle and the Pencil tools and how to join elements together to make seamless repeats. </p><p>You'll also learn to recolor your&nbsp;patterns and I'm willing to bet that you'll fall in love with the recolor tool as you&nbsp;use it to explore wonderful color schemes&nbsp;for your art.</p><p>In short, you'll learn techniques and tips that you can use everyday as you work in Illustrator and you'll grow in confidence with every completed lecture.</p><p><strong>How will I learn?</strong></p><p>This&nbsp;course is made up 100% of&nbsp;video content. You'll watch my screen as I show you how&nbsp;each pattern is made. I'll explain what I am doing and why so you can learn as you watch.&nbsp;</p><p>In one lecture you'll&nbsp;make a pattern from&nbsp;lots of small&nbsp;objects. Because making those objects isn't an important&nbsp;part of the class, we'll use some free to download vectors so you can get to work straight away.&nbsp;That way you can focus on the pattern and not the bits that go to making it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Join me...&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I hope you will join me in this Illustrator class.&nbsp;I look forward to meeting you and I invite you to contact me if you have any questions as you work through the lectures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>cheers!</p><p>Helen</p>",

  "description": "<p>  \t Brain-Computer Interface or BCI is a rapidly evolving technology that builds a direct channel between the human brain and the computer. BCI is a technology that enforces a collaboration between a brain and a device that enables signals from the brain to direct some external activity. This working together is aimed at either controlling a cursor or manipulating a prosthetic limb. The interface facilitates a direct communications path between the brain and the object to be controlled.  </p>  <p>  \t This introductory course will begin discussions on definitions, the history, benefits and drawbacks of BCI.  An introduction of how our brain works will also be discussed. The succeeding modules will discuss BCI components, types, BCI in animals and humans, medical and non-medical BCI applications, BCI technologies, and the current and future status of BCI.  </p>",

  "description": "<p>In the 21st century, pretty much everyone is a designer. Whether you want to be or not. If you work in marketing or comms you’ll be expected to just be able to design things. Or if you’re a solopreneur or have your own side business, you’ll want to create things that look as good as your competitors.</p><p>But as much as you might have good taste, and as good as you are with computers, or ideas, none of those things add up to having design skills.</p><p>So how do you learn them? And while you’re at it, how do you learn InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop – the programs design professionals use? Our Design Beginners Bootcamp will teach you those foundational skills, and supercharge your creative confidence.</p><p>Design Beginners Bootcamp is an intensive design workout. Starting from scratch you'll study a total of 12 mini courses, each one building on what you've learned previously to build your skills and confidence fast. But it's not just a graphic design course for beginners. </p><p>You’ll learn a mixture of Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign skills alongside graphic design theory. It’s very practical, teaching you how to create very specific things like infographics, branding and social media imagery, all the while attempting to explain why particular design choices were made.</p><p>This is the course I would have loved to have studied when I was a beginner at graphic design and all the Adobe programs. I hope you find it super useful, and you end up brimming with design confidence.</p><p>Here's a list of the courses in order:</p><p>1 – Create Icons and Logos with Illustrator</p><p>2 – Ten steps to better graphic design</p><p>3 – Working from InDesign packages &amp; templates</p><p>4 – Improving Images with Photoshop</p><p>5 – Create Website &amp; Social Media Images with Illustrator</p><p>6 – Typography Course</p><p>7 – Create Posters, Flyers, Adverts &amp; Postcards</p><p>8 – Create Social Media images with Photoshop</p><p>9 – Creating Basic Infographics with Illustrator</p><p>10 – Create a logo for your brand</p><p>11 – Getting Your Work Commercially Printed from InDesign</p><p>12 – How to cut people out with Photoshop</p><p><br></p><p><em>\"I am so glad I joined this bootcamp when I did. My job at a non-profit requires me to regularly create posters, social media posts, and brochures, but as a new Creative Cloud user, these projects were taking me longer than necessary. Peter’s class was a helpful foundational course that showed me just how much is possible with InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator. By implementing his tricks and tools, I’m on my way to becoming a better, faster, and more creative designer.\"</em></p><p><em>— Heather Pentecost, Events &amp; Development Associate, Linc Housing</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Very very good. Great pace and easy to follow.”<br>— Lucy Joy, Artist</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"I really enjoyed taking this class. I have learned so much from each module. It’s easy to follow and this is something that I will be going back to for future references. I’m hoping to take more classes in the future\".</em></p><p><em>— Gladdie Cabral, Social Media Assistant</em></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Blender 2.8 Model Texture Animate &amp; Simulate Complete Guide</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Course Description</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Hi and welcome to this new 3D Tudor course, ‘Blender 2.8 Model Texture Animation &amp; Simulation full Guide’. This is my most exciting course to date. The focus of this course is to show you how to make realistic models, to a real-world scale. Enroll in this course and experience 30 hours of content, full of learning opportunities to take your 3D modeling, animation and simulations skills to the next level. By completing this course, you will walk away with a comprehensive view of how to model from the ground up, with a super-fast workflow.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Modeling</strong></p><p>We will be creating a medieval catapult – the ultimate war-time machinery for ultimate casualty numbers. You will be familiar with those from your war simulation games, and this course will help you recreate this engineering masterpiece on your own. We will be creating a fully functioning medieval catapult, including the bolts and beams needed for everything to work in a hyper-realistic way. As this is part of my Blender 2.8 courses, we will be going through all the new shortcuts to model, texture, animate, and simulate a model. Advanced modeling techniques are included in this course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Texturing</strong></p><p>Texturing is perhaps the most important part of any 3D model. I will show you the most efficient and quickest ways of preparing a mesh for adding materials. We will be going over how to mark seems, how to correct texture resolutions, and how to UV unwrap. All these course components would be a course in their own right, so by enrolling, you will be able to develop your skills in a multi-faceted way. To save time on your usual trial and error process, I will show you the right and wrong way of doing this to fully prepare you and give you the skills to clean a 3D model mesh to industry standard.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Freebies</strong></p><p>You will be glad to know that this course comes with a library of resources that you are free to download and reuse in your other projects, or in the catapult project you upload as part of this course. I created all these textures and resources using Substance Designer, all custom made, specifically for this course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Bones</strong></p><p>This course will show you basic to intermediate skills of animating using Blender 2.8 software. We will be completing a complete armature from scratch, and you will learn how to place bones to help you make animating feel like a breeze. Using the techniques I will teach you, you will be able to export your animations into game engines like Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Unity. To help you keep up with the course progress, we will break down parts of the armature creation process, and I will show you how to organize everything efficiently.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Animation</strong></p><p>Have you ever wanted to learn how to build a full animation cycle? The learning outcomes of this course include creating a complete animation cycle in Blender 2.8. As part of animating this medieval catapult, we will be working on making it's propelling motion realistic, working hard to make each individual component move in a hyper-real way. You can apply these skills to any animations you decide to make in the future, and I would be excited to see you upload animations of other models as part of this course project. You will also be shown how to keyframe, and advanced components of this course within a course will show to create rope where the textures change as the animation rolls.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Simulation</strong></p><p>Fire is an essential component in every medieval catapult, and this course will also show you how to simulate a boulder’s flames. We will be simulating realistic fire and smoke using nothing more than Blender 2.8 to make a fully operable war machine. You will also learn how to create materials from scratch using the Blender 2.8 nodes system. We will be combining this fire simulation with your animation to create a medieval catapult model you can be proud of.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rendering</strong></p><p>Finally, after all the preparations for making a hyper-realistic medieval catapult model, truly worthy for a gruesome battlefield, we will be rendering the animation into a short film. You will learn how to use lighting from three high-dynamic-range images (HDRIs) – also include in this course for you to use, as a freebie. We will be setting up cameras and I will be going through different techniques to help improve the quality of your renders. Our render will be set out in the Blender 2.8 video editor.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course is approved for 1 GBCI Continuation Education (CE) credits. After completing the course you can report your credit towards LEED credential maintenance.</p><p>Using daylight in buildings is a key strategy for passive design. Efficient daylighting schemes help achieve comfort by offering optimum illumination, excellent color-rendering; avoiding glare and excessive brightness ratios which has a positive impact on occupant health and well being.</p><p>This course will discuss strategies that are necessary to be implemented during conceptual design to integrate the right elements for daylighting. These are simple yet very important elements that need to be decided at the very beginning to steer the design in the right direction. For example,&nbsp;carefully orienting the building for solar access, and controlling the quality and quantity of light as it enters inside a space.</p><p>Since most of the light that enters buildings is through windows and skylights, comprehending the set of strategies for effective fenestration design would make one’s job easier at the early design stage. These thumb-rules do not require many calculations but it does impact the overall building form, volume and space planning. This course also enumerates many interesting projects that showcase the successful integration of daylight for enhancing the character of a space.</p><p>The entire lecture is structured in 7 modules with highly visual and engaging content.&nbsp; At the end of the course, you will walk away with knowledge that you can apply in your work.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Hi and welcome to this new 3D Tudor Udemy course, ‘<strong>Blender 2.8 Model a Lightsaber for Beginners</strong>’. Sci-fi is here to stay and I am happy to announce that I am releasing another 3D Tudor modeling course under this genre. I have not moved to pastures anew permanently, but 3D Tudor courses aim to be versatile in helping you explore different art styles. The sci-fi genre would not be the same without certain archetypes, and with ‘<strong>Blender 2.8 Creating a Lightsaber for Beginners</strong>’, we will be learning how to make a lightsaber. As before, we are learning together, and trial and error will help your workflow as you will be presented with solutions to common problems.</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of my most exciting Udemy courses to date. Like my other Udemy course, ‘<strong>Blender 2.8 Beginners Guide To 3D Modeling A Sci-fi Scene’</strong>, I will be taking you on an extensive 3D modeling journey involving modeling, texturing, freebies, animation, lighting and rendering a sci-fi asset. The focus of this Udemy course is to show you how to make realistic models, to a real-world scale. Enroll in this Blender 2.8 course and experience over 8 hours of content, full of learning opportunities to take your 3D modeling, animation and simulations skills to the next level. By completing this course, you will walk away with a comprehensive view of how to model from the ground up, with a super-fast industry-standard workflow. All this exclusively in Blender 2.8.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Using everything I learned from previous courses, mainly from all your helpful feedback, I was able to make a course that really has the wow-factor; something you will be proud of accomplishing.</em></p><p><br></p><p>My move into the sci-fi scene has been met with remarkable student feedback, such as:</p><p><br></p><p>“I found the course great. And the asset is shaping to be something that looks at home in Metroid or Halo- I really think the end asset does look that good. Plus for a little extra spice, you could also bring the asset into Substance Painter and truly make it your own. Overall whether this is your first Blender course or you have been around before, the course is worth it. The instructor does not go too fast or skips about how he did; a, b, c -everything is explained.”.</p><p>Through my introduction of on-screen tooltips, 3D Tudor courses have become much more beginner-friendly and in-depth. The focus of this new course is to take anyone no matter their level in 3D modeling and teach them how to model a lightsaber from the ground up. The course has nearly 9 hours of content and is a one-stop course to take you on your way to a professional level. By joining this Udemy course you will engage in a journey of in-depth learning focused on the most important aspects of 3D modeling and animation. Blender Procedures will cover modeling, texturing, animation, lighting, and rendering. By the end of the course, you will have created a professional-looking sci-fi asset most commonly known as a lightsaber.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Modeling</strong></p><p>We will be creating one of the most famous sci-fi assets – the lightsaber – a contraption reminiscent of popular cinema titles. This course is coming out just a few months before a major game release that will revolutionize the sci-fi genre, Cyberpunk 2077 by Project Red.</p><p><br></p><p>‘<strong>Blender 2.8 Creating a Lightsaber for Beginners</strong>’ has a new learning format that will be relevant to beginners. This course is also relevant to those students who are more familiar with 3D creation and modeling using Blender software, or those who are transitioning into Blender from another piece of software or from the previous older versions of Blender.</p><p><br></p><p>This Udemy course aims to teach you from the ground up. It will cover the very basics of modeling and teach you the tips and tricks that the pros use in Blender 2.8. This course explains everything and will include a step-by-step exploration of all the new shortcuts that have come with this new Blender version. You will be able to keep up with the course’s pace through having an on-screen visual tooltip. Anything that needs some explanation is explained easily using a small pop-up box, so you will never be lost. My goal here is to not only have students re-create this lightsaber but for them to come away with a comprehensive understanding of how and why. By the end of the course, the knowledge you will have learned can be put to use independent of the direction you take in 3D modeling – following the amateur or the professional path.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Texturing</strong></p><p>Texturing is perhaps the most important part of any 3D model. I will show you the most efficient and quickest ways of preparing a mesh for adding materials in Blender. We will be going over how to mark seems, how to correct texture resolutions, and how to UV-unwrap. A new thing in this course will be learning how to mark sharps, so that you can create hard and soft edges for your 3D models within Blender 2.8. You will also be able to keep these edges you create even if you are exporting to Substance Painter or Unreal Engine 4. All these course components would be a course in their own right, so by enrolling, you will be able to develop your skills in a multi-faceted way. To save time on your usual trial and error process, I will show you both the right and the wrong way of doing this. You will be fully prepared and provided with the skills to ‘clean’ a 3D model mesh to an industry standard.</p><p><br></p><p>We will also explore the Blender 2.8 node system in depth, where you will learn not only how to import textures and maps, but also how to change the way materials look.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Animation</strong></p><p>Have you ever wanted to learn how to build a full animation cycle? The learning outcomes of this Udemy course include creating a complete animation cycle in Blender 2.8. The lightsaber we will be creating will be animated with light coming out and in. The animation will be set up in such a way that the light (i.e., blade) will be following the assigned movement consistent with how the lightsaber moves – making it perfect for fight scenes!. You will learn all about armatures and bones, and you will be shown how to keyframe. We will move on to the complex fundamentals of animations, where we learn how to weight and attach bones to meshes. This is exactly the same process as in Hollywood for computer-generated imaging (CGI) or the respective gaming industry. You can apply these skills to any animations you decide to make in the future, and I would be excited to see you upload animations of other models as part of this Udemy course project.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Freebies</strong></p><p>You will be glad to know that this Udemy course comes with a small resource pack of five 2k resolution texture maps including all albedo (i.e., color), normal, roughness, metallic, and displacement maps free to download with this course. These are resources that you are free to download and reuse in your other projects. You could also utilize them in your lightsaber course project, which you are encouraged to upload as part of this course. Freebies also include two references, created in Adobe Photoshop, created specifically for this course: a dual lightsaber, and a small lightsaber. I created all these textures and resources using a mix of Substance Painter, and Adobe Photoshop. All textures included for free with this course are custom made specifically for this course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lighting</strong></p><p>I always feel that lighting is one of the key components that tend to be the most overlooked. To be honest, I learned this the hard way, seeing as lighting is important with regards to making a scene look overwhelmingly beautiful or realistic or tragically bad. I went back to the drawing board and developed my skills in Blender and in lighting. Over time, I learned exactly how to light scenes. This knowledge I now pass on to my students. You will learn all about Blender 2.8 lighting and lighting effects.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rendering</strong></p><p>Finally, after all the preparations for making a realistic sci-fi scene, we will be rendering two stills in one of the best renderers in the industry – Eevee Render. Through this course, you will gain the knowledge to create great-looking scenes in Eevee rendering engine. We will also be setting up studio lighting to create a nice render for a portfolio piece. You will spend a lot of time on getting your emission nodes correct. We will be setting up cameras and I will be going through different techniques to help improve the quality of your renders.</p><p><br></p><p>Happy modeling everyone!</p><p>Neil, 3D Tudor</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Get started with Character Design and Development by learning the basics of 3D and using Simple Shapes.&nbsp; After finding and using the best shapes for our design, we'll begin discovering how to manipulate and adjust them into the look we're after. In this case, a cute carrot. Even the most simple 3D sculpts can actually be quite complicated depending on how much fine detail you want to put in. The good thing is that is what makes 3D with Nomad Sculpt fun!&nbsp;</p><p>- We'll then move into adding eyes, eye lashes, and details to get it looking a bit more \"real\". </p><p>- Setting up our carrot with the most flattering lighting possible and then adding color. Feel free to experiment</p><p>with colors and textures! Remember, this is your art so you don't have to follow everything that I do. Rogues are welcome!</p><p>- Once we've finished with coloring and lighting we can start post processing and adjust the scene and character before export.&nbsp; Exporting or \"Rendering\" means you've successfully created your first 3D character! Or maybe it isn't your first, but I&nbsp;hope you learned some new tricks and ways of thinking throughout! </p><p>The ideas and ways of thinking are most of what I want to leave you with...shapes are very easy to make, so just think of everything as shapes or part of shapes. Shapes within shapes even. I've found that even the most complicated sculpts aren't so bad when I just break them down into one shape after another. Veggies for instance: A grape is pretty much a sphere. Banana is a stretched sphere. Cucumber slice is a cylinder. A&nbsp;snow cone is a cone with a sphere on top. As you continue to sculpt more and more you'll find the shapes much easier and your sculpting will get faster and faster. </p>",

  "description": "<p>This course will cover the design phase of one character meant for a video game production and transferable to other media, from first conception to fully rendered splash or key art for promotional purposes. Students will learn how to initially thumbnail a design before taking it to a rough and then finalized front/back character rotation, including this character’s costume and equipment. Further exploration into this character’s backstory and personality will also result in several design sheets. These include an expression sheet, passive acting pose sheet and action pose sheet. Students will also later delve further into development of this character’s in-game costume and equipment, and even be introduced to producing basic thumbnails or keyframes to explore how this character may move during gameplay or combat. Finally, students will be introduced to a simple, step by step method that will take them from thumbnail phase to a finished, polished and full colour render of their character. This final volume covers everything from nailing down a solid pose, dynamic composition, colour choices and preparing the image to be painted. A series of lighting and shadow passes, followed by a detailed polish and special effects step will complete the illustration. Upon completing this series, the student will have an in-depth glimpse into what it takes to design a single character for video games or other media.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More about the Instructor:</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Colin Searle is a Designer and Illustrator living in Toronto and working fulltime as a designer for Elliott Animation, currently taking on freelance and client work from studios like Ubisoft and several others. He likes to exercise and draw, and he's not sure which one he likes doing more!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Take your animation skills to the next level by learning all about 3D layers, cameras, and lights in Adobe After Effects. In this class, you’ll learn how to bring your 2D artwork into the 3rd dimension with After Effects. Your flat artwork will become alive in space, giving it depth and energy.</p>\n\n<p>You can watch this course in just over 3 hours, but to cement your knowledge I recommend creating your very own animated 3D postcard of your favourite city, which could take 5-30 hours, depending on your design, animation technique, and duration of animation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course is structured into 22 videos, each covering a specific topic. The videos build upon previous video as I show you how I go about creating a 3D animation, based off of some flat 2D Illustrator artwork.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t have to get into big and fancy 3D applications to have fun with 3D. Use your current Photoshop and Illustrator skillset in combination with After Effects to bring your flat-designs to life – it’s not <em>such</em> a big jump to go from Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop to Adobe After Effects. They all play really nicely with each other.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Besides getting into 3D with Adobe After Effects, there are a bunch of tips and tricks you’ll pick up even if you’re an After Effects and 3D pro. That being said, this class is meant for beginner to intermediate students, who have a little bit of experience in Adobe After Effects.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Come have fun and create an awesome piece of motion graphics with me!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here’s what we cover:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this class we cover everything from importing correctly set up files to rendering awesome animations. There are in-depth videos about 3D layer properties, different types of cameras and camera settings, the kinds of lights you can add to your scene, precomposing and parenting layers, being productive in After Effects, adding multiple views, animating layers in a 3D space, and many more tips and tricks.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Stylised 3D Game Model: Complete Beginners’ Guide</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Hi and welcome to this new 3D Tudor Udemy course, ‘<strong>Stylised 3D Game Model: Complete Beginners’ Guide</strong>’. This is complete beginner’s guide to creating a 3D stylised game model. This course will teach you how to create a stylised 3D model from scratch to a professional level, following industry pipelines. If you ever wondered how AAA assets are made by some of the biggest players in the industry, then stay tuned and find out what this course is all about.</p><p>Like my other Udemy courses, I will be taking you on an extensive 3D modeling journey involving modeling, texturing, freebies, lighting and rendering a game ready 3D asset. The focus of this Udemy course is to show you how to make realistic models, to a real-world scale. Enroll in this Blender 2.83 course and experience over 8 hours of content, full of learning opportunities to take your 3D modeling, sculpting, texturing, lighting and rendering skills up by quite a few notches. By completing this course, you will walk away with a comprehensive view of how to model from the ground up, with a super-fast industry-standard workflow. All this exclusively in Blender 2.8.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‘Stylised 3D Game Model: Complete Beginners’ Guide’</strong> has a new learning format that will be relevant to beginners. This course is also relevant to those students who are more familiar with 3D creation and modeling using Blender software, or those who are transitioning into Blender from another piece of software or from the previous older versions of Blender.</p><p><em>Using everything I learned from previous courses, mainly from all your helpful feedback, I was able to make a course that really has the wow-factor; something you will be proud of accomplishing.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Modelling</strong></p><p>This course will teach you how to model stylised assets from the ground up, using Blender 2.83. Whether you are an absolute beginner or someone who is looking to elevate their skill level, animations will be telling you all about modifiers, Blender functions, and key commands, which will guide you along the way – popping up right when you need them. This course explains everything and will include a step-by-step exploration of all the new shortcuts that have come with this new Blender version. Best of all, this unique course functionality also lets you set your own pace. This allows the course to be viable for Blender users of any level.</p><p>By the end of the course, the knowledge you will have learned can be put to use independent of the direction you take in 3D modeling – following the amateur or the professional path.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sculpting</strong></p><p>Next, to take our 3D model to the next level, we take a deep dive into Zbrush. You will learn various simple Zbrush techniques to bring your 3D creation to life. This course will take you through the very basics of the Zbrush UI, all the way up to preparing a model for export. What is more, you will be learning new sculpting skills, in addition to learning how to optimise your model to make it game ready.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Texturing</strong></p><p>In this section, we will be using Substance Painter. Substance Painter is an industry standard software. You will learn how to create complex stylised materials from scratch. We will also go over how to lay or apply multiple materials to meshes. As we texture, we will take an in depth look at how to create texture bakes using high- and low-poly models. In the end, you will come away with a broad understanding of maps and textures, all in just a few hours.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rendering</strong></p><p>Finally, to present our model in the professional way and make it really stand out in any portfolio, we will be rendering out in Marmoset Toolbag 3. We look at the best texture maps to use for rendering, and we will go over how to set up not only just one render, but three, including a fully textured and wireframe turntable. You will come away with renders which you will be proud to show off on your social media. By the time we have finished rendering in Marmoset Toolbag 3, you will have the knowledge and confidence to create stylised assets that look like they fell out straight out of a game.</p><p>I always feel that lighting is one of the key components that tend to be the most overlooked. To be honest, I learned this the hard way, seeing as lighting is important with regards to making a scene pop. I have taught you how to set up your lighting in my previous course, ‘Blender 2.8 Model a Lightsaber for Beginners’, within Blender, but this time, we will take it a step further. All lighting including environment lighting and extra light were set up within Marmoset Toolbag 3.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Download Pack</strong></p><p>Best of all, this course also comes with a free download pack, full of everything you will need for the course. This will include things like full references, Zbrush brushes, and textures just to name a few. The ‘Stylised 3D Game Model: Complete Beginners’ Guide’ course download pack will include 3 different brushes, one resolution map, five rope textures (albedo, height, metallic, normal, roughness), a skull decal, and a wood grain illustration.</p><p>These are resources that you are free to download and reuse in your other projects. I created all these textures and resources using a mix of Substance Designer, and Adobe Photoshop (e.g., for the smoke decal). All textures included for free with this course are custom made specifically for this course.</p><p><br></p><p>So, with all that said, I hope I have whetted your appetite to start your journey into stylised 3D game asset creation. Check out the free introduction and I am sure you won’t be able to put this course down. Check it out. You have nothing to lose, but everything to gain.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>I had a blast making this course and I am sure you will too!</p><p><br></p><p>Happy modeling everyone!</p><p>Neil, 3D Tudor</p>",

Included is a sample font to get you started, discussions of concepts, and many practical demonstrations of the process of creating a font.  </p>  <p>  \t     If you have been wanting to design your own font, this course will give you a basic production procedure you can build into a workflow that fits your working style.  </p>  <p>  \t     The course materials will serve as a visual reference to complement the content of David&#039;s popular book, <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Practical Font Design Third Edition Plus</em></strong>. A downloadable PDF copy of the book is included with the course, plus a sample font you can use to start your new fonts. He will show you how to use the sample font.  </p>  <p>  \t   You can complete the course in a week or two, but the production of your first font will take several months up to nearly a year to complete.  </p>  <p>  \t   The course materials will remain a reference as you progress in your craft of font design.  </p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Cinema 4D</strong>'s new <strong>simulation</strong> engine makes it possible to create extraordinary realistic or abstract animations!</p><p><br></p><p>In this new module of the <strong>complete Cinema 4D training course,</strong> you'll find out all about the new rigid body, soft body, fabric and rope simulation tools!</p><p><br></p><p>Topple dominoes, demolish walls, create hypnotic fabric animations, transform lettering into balloons or old pleated leather, animate floating flags and tear them apart - it's all possible now with <strong>Cinema 4D</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>In <strong>clearly organized chapters,</strong> we'll study all the techniques needed to <strong>master </strong>the various simulations.</p><p><br></p><p>This Cinema 4D training course on physical simulations covers the following topics:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Rigid bodies</strong> are the properties that enable objects to collide with each other and create <strong>complex dynamic sequences</strong> automatically. The animation possibilities are virtually <strong>infinite</strong>, and effectively complement traditional animation using <strong>keyframes </strong>or <strong>Mograph</strong>. You can even combine the three at the same time!</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Drape</strong>, <strong>fly </strong>and <strong>twist </strong>clothes in extraordinary abstract animations! Or use them to dress your characters with stunning realism.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>You will model a <strong>dress </strong>entirely on a dancing <strong>cartoon character</strong>. The fabric follows the character's movements naturally and dynamically, for maximum realism. <strong>The entire workflow is covered</strong>, from dress modeling and finishing to testing and caching for easy playback.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Soft bodies</strong> simulate anything <strong>plastic</strong>, <strong>rubbery </strong>or easily deformed. It makes for very smooth, fun animations and can be easily combined with rigid bodies.</p></li></ul><p>This module is the ideal complement to the one devoted to <strong>Mograph</strong>, as it takes up certain elements and <strong>completes </strong>them.</p><p><br></p><p>As usual, all the videos are <strong>clearly named</strong> and <strong>organized </strong>so you can quickly access the one that interests you. <strong>Mini-projects </strong>complete the videos to help you put the <strong>skills </strong>you've learned into <strong>practice</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Please note that this tutorial is intended for <strong>Cinema 4D version 2024.2</strong> and higher, which uses the new <strong>unified simulation system</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>All source files are provided. I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have !</p><p><br></p><p>Enjoy the tutorial!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Are you ready to take your videos to the next level? </strong></p><p>This easy to follow course will help you make original, custom animations using <em>Adobe Photoshop </em>that look professional and can be used as stand-alone movies (without needing any other software) or in combination with other video, animation, and multimedia software programs for a full range of effects and purposes. <strong>FREE trials of Photoshop are available at Adobe's website.</strong></p><p>In this course you will learn my very favorite animation and video rotoscoping techniques to create powerful multimedia projects ranging from laughably simple (think stick figures waving) to more sophisticated and complex (such as my own award-winning series of films screened internationally in film festivals and online since 2002.)</p><p><strong>In this course you'll learn step by step how to:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Harness the power of Photoshop to create simple or complex frame by frame animations, with or without using Photoshop's timeline.</p></li><li><p>Easily turn a regular video into a stop-motion animated video by making simple frame rate adjustments.</p></li><li><p>Apply a full range of effects to your video to create animated elements or a stand-alone animation even if you CAN'T DRAW.</p></li><li><p>Coax Photoshop to animate objects and layers for you (without having to draw anything) by making position, size, and opacity changes, to name just a few possibilities.</p></li><li><p>Craft multiple effects at once to create more complex final animations by using multiple layers.</p></li><li><p>Capture complex movements by bringing in video, drawing right over it, and (optionally) throwing the video guide out so all that is left is your new animation with its sophisticated movements. (That's rotoscoping!)</p></li></ul><p>I start from the very beginning using Adobe Photoshop. Free 30 day trials of <em>Photoshop</em> are available from Adobe's website BUT many of the techniques I show you in this course (such as frame by frame animation) can be achieved in virtually any imaging software combined with your favorite video editing program.<br></p><p><br><strong>All of my techniques are explained so you will 100% understand how they work.</strong> You can then decide how much time you will spend on each animation which will then affect your end results. </p><p>--<strong><br>What Students Are Saying:</strong><br></p><p><em>\"Loved this course! Kristen is very thorough in her instruction and shows multiple ways to accomplish the various tasks included in the animation process. She discusses everything from where to get video to drawing techniques and final presentation. This was a fun course and I recommend it to anyone interested in learning the basics of animation in Photoshop or a similar program.\"</em> -Deborah Wojcicki</p><p>--</p><p>As an educator, I’ve taught at universities and organizations on four continents. I co-founded the Digital Media track of the Communication Program at The American University of Rome, where I taught full-time from 2006, earned tenure in 2009, and led the Film and Digital Media Program from 2013 to 2016. From 2016 to 2019, I expanded my teaching to academic institutions and NGOs in Myanmar, including the groundbreaking American University of Myanmar. Currently, I offer in-person, hybrid, and online courses for individuals, international organizations, and universities.</p><p><br></p><p>Since 2000 I've been teaching students all over the world using my tried and true custom approach (turning complex information&nbsp; into something simple, memorable, easy-to-understand in as short amount&nbsp; of time as possible) to ensure that <strong>you get the most important, relevant, and useful information that can be&nbsp; applied immediately.<br></strong></p><p>New bonus lectures and resources will continue to be added and timely&nbsp; advice will be provided in the discussion forum. I love to help&nbsp; and always respond to inquiries and discussions ASAP.<br></p><p><strong>Please Note: All students who enroll in this course also will receive periodic&nbsp; free and discounted access to my other top-rated current and upcoming&nbsp; courses.<br></strong></p><p>You have a 30-day, 100% money-back guarantee with no questions asked so you have nothing to lose.

  "description": "<p>Hello Everyone and welcome to this new course. In this course, we will go over the entire process of creating a <strong>Kitchen Environment</strong> using Unreal Engine 5, Blender, Substance Painter.</p><p>We will go over modelling in Blender, texturing using Substance Painter and setting up the scene, lighting and materials in Unreal Engine 5.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You will get:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>27 Full HD video lectures with over 11 hours of content and AUDIO commentary.</strong></p><p>2. <strong>All the files related to the course including .blend files, unreal project files, substance files, reference images, textures etc.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>SOFTWARES USED - (BLENDER, Substance Painter, Unreal Engine 5):</strong></p><p>All the modelling will be done in Blender, However, the techniques used are universal and can be replicated in any other 3D modelling package. The materials and textures will be created using Substance Painter. Level art, lighting and composition will be done in Unreal Engine 5.</p><p>In this course, you will learn everything you need to know to create the final results that you see in the images and trailers. The same techniques can be applied to almost any type of environment.</p><p><strong>This course has over 11 hours of content! (All the videos have audio commentary)</strong></p><p>We will go over each and every step in this course together and nothing will be skipped. The course does not have any kind of timelapses so that you can follow every step easily.</p><p>We will start by gathering some reference images to gain some initial ideas and the mood for our scene. We will arrange these reference images in a free program called <strong>PureRef</strong>. After this we will move on to <strong>Blender </strong>and start modelling our main assets. We will go over the entire process of modelling this from start to finish in <strong>Blender </strong>only. We will start by modelling some of our main assets such as the stove, fridge, and the cabinets.</p><p>After we have modeled all our assets, we will export them to Substance Painter to start the texturing process. We will learn to create high quality and realistic materials and the key features of Substance Painter like Smart Masks, generators, smart materials etc.</p><p>After this we will import all our models into Unreal Engine and export the textures from Painter to Unreal Engine. The next step would be to setup our lighting and create a mood and atmosphere for our scene. We will make use of the new features of Unreal Engine such as <strong>Lumen</strong> to get realistic lighting for our scene, next we will set up a post-Processing volume to further enhance the visuals of our scene.</p><p>Then we will spend some more time creating a lot of small props for our scene to further detail the scene even more. We will end this course by adding some food items from Quixel Megascans, setting up different camera angles and taking high resolution screenshots for our portfolio.<br>So, I hope to see you there in the course, thank you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who is this course for?</strong></p><p>Students that have basic knowledge of modelling, texturing and want to learn how to create environments. Everything in this course would be explained in detailed but some prior knowledge of the software would be helpful.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

The curriculum is carefully crafted so you will learn SketchUp in the most <strong>effective</strong> and <strong>efficient</strong> way. In <strong>less than 7 hours</strong>, in sha Allah, you will be able to master all the available tools and use them to create a <strong>3D house</strong> design from start to finish.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What you will learn</strong></p><p>There are so many things you will learn in this online course. There are just too many to explain in this description text. To see the details, you can scroll down to the curriculum section. But, just for a quick summary. This online course consists of <strong>9 chapters</strong>, apart from the introduction chapter.</p><p>In the first chapter, you will learn the interface of SketchUp Free as well as its basic features. You will learn to import 3D models from the 3D warehouse. Then learn how to do navigation, and use different types of \"views\". Next, you'll learn how to use the \"scenes\" feature. And then we will discuss how to change the appearance of the 3D models using \"Styles\". After that, we will discuss various commands related to files. And also learn how to create a \"custom shortcut\".</p><p>In the second chapter, we will discuss basic 3D modeling techniques. We'll start by learning the line tool. Then discuss the concepts and features of \"inference\" in SketchUp. After that, we will discuss the \"Rectangle\" tool. And then discuss one of the most important tools in SketchUp, called the \"push-pull\" tool. Also in this chapter, we will discuss various object selection techniques. And techniques for deleting objects. Finally, we will cover how to use the \"offset\" tool.</p><p>The third chapter is a practice chapter. First, we will model a \"planter box\" object. Then create a 3D model of a cabinet. After that, we will try to create a 3d model of a pet house.</p><p>In the fourth chapter, we will focus on object manipulation and object management techniques available in SketchUp Free. There are many things that we will discuss in this chapter. Some of them are, object transformation, from the basic to advanced techniques. Then, learn how to use \"tags\" to manage 3D objects more easily and quickly. Next, you will learn various duplication techniques. Then learn how to group objects either with the basic \"group\" method or with the more advanced method using \"component\".</p><p>In the fifth chapter, we will discuss various advanced modeling techniques. You will learn how to use \"Rotated rectangle\". Learn the ins and outs of the \"circle\" tool and the \"polygon\" tool. Then learn the concepts and techniques of smoothing 3D object surfaces. Then, you will learn how to use the \"Freehand\" tool as well as the \"Arc\" tool. And then create 3D text objects. And finally, learn to use the \"follow me\" tool.</p><p>The sixth chapter is a special chapter for 3D modeling exercises. We will make use of the advanced techniques discussed earlier. We will start by modeling a coffee table. Then learn to model a classic gate. Then learn how to model a \"square pillar\". Next, we will discuss the techniques for creating a double-sided door. Starting by making the door frame, then the door leaf. And finally, we'll create the doorknob. Next, you will learn how to model a book. The last project in chapter six is ​​creating a stair and its railing. You will learn a simple yet effective method for defining the stair steps without doing complex calculations manually.</p><p>The seventh chapter focuses on discussing measurement and annotation techniques. Here you will learn the \"Tape measure\" tool, and then also the \"protractor\" tool. Next, you will learn different methods for assigning labels such as for dimensions or simply for adding comments. Then, we'll cover how to create cutouts of our 3D model using the \"section plane\". And finally, you will learn how to create \"custom axes\".</p><p>In chapter eight, you will learn to use materials and textures. In addition to learning to use the materials provided by SketchUp, you will also learn to create your own materials and textures. After that, we will discuss various methods of manipulation for textures that are already attached to 3d object surfaces. We will cover both flat surfaces and also curved surfaces.</p><p>In the last chapter, or chapter nine. We will create the final project which is a house. We'll start by importing the reference image. Then model the walls. Add windows and doors. Then create the floor, the surrounding area, and also the carport. We will create the roof which will be a double-stacking type. Then make a large canopy that covers the terrace and carport area. Finally, we'll add ornaments for the house facade. In sha Allah, you will be able to create a house 3D model from start to finish if you follow this course from start to finish.</p><p><br></p><p>So, don't wait any longer. <strong>Join this online course now!</strong> and improve your skill in the Architectural field.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Welcome the Beginners Course for Cricut Explore Users with Design Space Version 3.</strong></p><p>ScrappyDew has put together several videos that are important for those wanting to learn a little more about their machine. Although Cricut Design Space is made for simplicity, there are several great hidden features built within the program. Throughout the course, we start you out with the basic foundation of the program and the machine. We then take what we have learned in previous videos and apply them in real-world scenarios.</p><p><strong>So why watch these through ScrappyDew's Classroom?</strong> This is a question that is asked a lot and here's the bottom line.</p><p><strong>All of our videos are...</strong></p><p><strong>Short &amp; Concise</strong> - Many YouTube video presenters have a hard time staying focused and on task. We value your time and provide you with the proper amount of video in order to meet the objectives.</p><p><strong>No Ads or Distractions </strong>- Have you ever had to wait for a video to play on YouTube due to an Ad?</p><p><strong>Arranged in an order that makes sense </strong>- On YouTube you will randomly search and hope that you find what you need.</p><p><strong>End of video commenting </strong>- Do you request feedback on a certain topic? Ask it at the bottom of every video. Your comments will only be seen to registered students.</p><p><strong>Design Space Changes</strong> - When the layout of Design Space changes so will our videos. We recognize that it can be frustrating when watching old YouTube videos. The reason why YouTubers keep up outdated material is that they are still getting YouTube hits and recognition. What this creates is a frustrated user when they are trying to compare what they are seeing in the video to their own newer updated version of Design Space.</p><p><strong>HD Video and Professional Audio Recording Equipment were used </strong>- Have you ever watched a video and the sound just wasn't up to par? That really makes for a bad video/learning experience. We ensured that we have quality microphones in a background noise-free zone (no kids or barking dogs). </p><p><br></p><p>We hope you enjoy the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course will demonstrate methods for quickly coloring character artwork in a  cell shaded style, while focusing on production value as well as  flexibility. We'll cover multiple techniques, including isolating scanned artwork onto a transparent background,  and preparing lines for color using levels. It will also cover how  to use clipping masks, layer masks,  adjustment layers, and a number of other tools and functions in  Photoshop. These tools and techniques will then be put into practice to  create a base layer onto which all of the flat local color layers will  clip. Adjustment layers will be placed over these flat colors in order  to light the character.</p><p>Throughout the course, various shortcuts and  time-saving methods will be used to speed up workflow as much as  possible. Other than speed, the other focus of these methods is their  nondestructive quality, which allows the artist to go back into any stage or  section of the piece and easily change it. The course also covers how to  push the appeal of the character by employing gradients to add  dimension and interest, and using a combination of cell shading and painterly  techniques to get the most out of the character and ultimately produce a high  quality piece of character artwork.</p><p><strong>Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)</strong><br></p><p>More about the Instructor:</p><p>Colleen (Peck) Larson is a freelance  concept artist living in California's Bay area.  She is a semester away from earning her  BFA in Illustration from San Jose State University, and previously she's had the opportunity to work for  companies such as Firaxis Games and Gaia Interactive, but  currently she is a concept artist interning at Zynga in San Francisco.  Her obsessions lie equally between art,  video games, cats, and her husband Erik.</p>",

  "description": "<p>We will design together a tower in 3D starting from a sketch all the way to renderings and layout. </p><p>During the process, i will make sure to hit all the most important commands that you need to know as a designer. </p><p>I have been using Rhino as a design Architect for more than 15 years. What i realized is that you only need to know approximately 80 to 100 commands to model any geometry that your architecture journey will put before you. </p><p>In this course i will cover 130 commands which will give you a solid toolbox to generate the simple but also the more advanced massing.</p><p>At the end of each chapter, you will see a workflow consolidation course. This is where you will gradually enrich your shortcut skills and efficiency in using the software. This is an important step that will help you save a lot of time in your modeling.</p><p>Since Rhino rendering isn't the best. I&nbsp;added a course using a free software that is way more appropriate for designers. With a minimum amount of effort, you can get out amazing images and save a lot of time on designing instead of setting up lighting, texture, people etc...</p><p>Finally you will learn how to get the most out of your 3D&nbsp;model for diagrams by playing with the Rhino Display Mode. Texture Mapping, adding shadows, play with line-weight etc.. </p><p>We will also see how to slice your model and generate Layout with annotations. </p><p>A 100% of what you see in the presentation video is extracted from the course. </p><p>This course is appropriate for all levels, even for absolute beginner. </p><p>I will be using Rhino 8 for PC. Mac users, and or PC users with lower Rhino versions can still follow the class as more than 90% of the commands will be the same. However, for the rendering software i am presenting in Chapter 9, Mac users will not be able to use it as it is not compatible. </p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Want to start learning Houdini, but scared of the steep learning curve? Looking to quickly replace your workflow in other 3D applications with Houdini?<br><br>In this course I've made it easy to learn Houdini. The course is designed to instantly get you up and running in the software, by creating a product-shot. Therefore you can easily replace your current 3D application with Houdini and start diving intro more complex topic from there.</p><p>Like many others I've started learning Houdini by instantly diving into particle networks and fluid simulations. But it actually took me a while before I really started to understand some basic principles, like using normals and UV's in Houdini. Resulting in jumping back and forth between 3D application. Therefore I've created this course to give you a solid foundation in Houdini.</p><p>You'll learn how to download and install Houdini, how the UI works and how to work with nodes in general. From there we'll dive into topics like working with primitives, creating cameras, working with point colour, bending deformers, groups, copy objects, splines and sweeps, lathes (revolve), booleans, copy to points, extrude objects, normals and UV's.</p><p>Lastly we'll look into rendering in Redshift, using attributes, textures, Maxon noise, HDR lighting, dappled light, sunlight, different types of materials, and Postfx.</p><p>So if you're ready to start your journey in Houdini then sign up today and get started!</p>",
