  "description": "<p>From this course, you can learn <strong>Secure Coding in Java.</strong></p><p>There are a lot of other courses on this topic. <strong>So, why would you choose exactly this course?&nbsp; </strong>Here are just a few reasons:<br><br><strong>- Coding examples</strong></p><p>To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO&nbsp;and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you. Probably you always dreamed about running your startup?&nbsp;In this course, you will be able to find the team who will teach you how to do that and (in particular cases) will be glad to help with implementation! </p><p>Hope you enjoy this course! And remember, we appreciate all your feedback! Your feedback will help us to become even better!&nbsp;Your feedback will help us to create to best Java course ever! </p><p>See you at the lessons!&nbsp;:)</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Another Vue.js 3 from zero to hero course - <em>kind of</em>. This course is for developers who want to move <em>fast</em>. We cover the traditional way of building Vue apps - the Options API - as well as the the new Composition API, and even see how you can mix and match them together. </p><p>There are 8 modules; 4 introduce fundamental skills (Options API; Composition API; Vuex and Vue Router). The remaining four modules are projects, so you can see how to apply the fundamental skills in real apps. I am a big believer in <em>learning by doing.</em></p><p>After learning both the Options and Composition API, we see how to use them both with Vuex and Vue Router, and talk about the different use-cases and trade-offs to consider.</p><p>Finally, as we progress through, our focus starts to shift from not only how to build apps with Vue, but to thinking about how we architect things; how components should communicate, where data should be saved (also known as state management) and how it flows through the app.</p><p>The course is taught by Vue.js team member Lachlan Miller, so you can be confident you are in good hands.</p><p>After covering Vue; we look at Vuex, Vue's state management solution, and Vue Router, for front-end routing.&nbsp;The course culminates with a capstone project, using the three core Vue libraries (Vue, Vuex, Vue Router) to build an application.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course requires you to download Docker Desktop from Docker's official website. If you are a Udemy Business user, please check with your employer before downloading software.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>100% Answer Rate! </strong>Every single question posted to this class is answered within 24 hours <em>by the instructor.</em></p><p>Do you want to create a WordPress theme that really works? Would you like to learn how to edit a WordPress theme without suffering?</p><p>I know that searching the Internet for articles and tutorials is quite frustrating. But if you really want to learn everything about creating WordPress themes, you've found the right course! This course will pave the way for you to become an official WordPress theme developer.</p><p>Imagine yourself doing what you love most, whether at home or in your own company, being your own boss, and even earning top dollar! Good developers can earn <strong>from $3,000 to $15,000</strong> creating a custom WordPress theme. So knowing how to create WordPress themes is synonymous with being able to earn very well, as this is currently one of the most sought-after skills on the market. WordPress is behind 30% of websites worldwide. In other words, it is a growing market!</p><p>If you are looking to earn extra money, or even want to work as a full-time freelancer, this course will prove to be perfect for you. It brings what I call a 'simplified approach' to the subject, because that's the way I tried to structure the course for you. I didn't have chances to learn in an easy way in the past, which is why I decided to make it as easy as possible for my students.</p><p>You won't have to go through all the tiresome and often useless research that I had to go through. Everything I learned is summarized in this course. It covers all the fundamental aspects of learning how to create a WordPress theme from scratch. You will be catapulted to a new professional level.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will have a solid foundation to become a skilled theme developer. You will be able to master a complete set of skills such as creating a theme independently, or editing a third-party WordPress theme. Take a look at what my student Walton Jones has to say:</p><p><em>\"Three weeks ago, I knew very little about WordPress. Today I am laying the finishing touches on a WordPress site for a client that they are very pleased with. This is all thanks to this course. Marcelo is an awesome, responsive teacher who was always quick to answer my questions.\"</em></p><p>Here are some of the things you no longer need, because all the necessary knowledge will already be at your fingertips:</p><ul><li><p>You no longer need to read pages and more pages of documentation to understand how to create WordPress themes;</p></li><li><p>You no longer need to waste time reading long tutorials on the web;</p></li><li><p>You no longer have to be bored looking for or watching useless content on YouTube.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>What exactly will I learn?</strong></p><p>The course will be divided into two moments.</p><p><strong><em>Moment 1:</em></strong></p><p>This first part will have 6 sections, in which we will create the WordPress theme from start to finish. We will talk about topics such as:</p><ul><li><p>WordPress installation using Local and/or Docker. Yes, we stopped using Xampp for everyone's sake and included Local (the favorite installation tool for WordPress devs at the moment) and Docker;</p></li><li><p>template hierarchy, enqueueing of scripts and stylesheets;</p></li><li><p>menu creation, including responsive menus just using CSS, HTML and Javascript. Yes, at last, now the theme course will no longer depend on any plugin to work;</p></li><li><p>the WordPress loop, both the default loop and the custom loop (using the WP_Query class);</p></li><li><p>inclusion of several types of theme_support;</p></li><li><p>widget areas, permalinks, the main template files, the various types of pagination;</p></li><li><p>template parts and conditional tags (another new subject);</p></li><li><p>the powerful Theme Customizer;</p></li><li><p>theme translation and security. Yes, I've included lessons about security in WordPress themes (!);</p></li><li><p>site migration from the local server to a remote server.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>Moment 2:</em></strong></p><p>In a second moment, there will be a bonus section with some complementary subjects, which will help you understand a little bit more about the theme creation universe, as well as introduce some trends regarding this subject.</p><p>We'll talk about page builders. We will introduce you to child themes, talk about Docker, and especially about Gutenberg (the block editor and new features brought by WordPress in versions 5.8 and 5.9, such as block-based themes, the theme.json file, etc.).</p><p>This is meant to get you started transitioning from what they are now calling \"classic themes\" to brand-new block-based themes. The course will not teach you how to create block themes yet, but it will be a good start.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How can you tell if this course is really different?</strong></p><p>What makes this course unique is the versatility and benefits it delivers. This course brings you 69 highly comprehensive lessons, all carefully organized in sections, leaving no important subject behind.</p><p>But the best thing about the course is my willingness to help you. My biggest priority is to make sure that you get to the end of the course with no doubts. That's why the absolute majority of questions are answered within 24 hours, allowing you to study at your own pace with nothing to get in your way.</p><p>I am sure that other courses cannot afford to have students saying things like this:</p><p><br></p><p><em>\"I'm almost done with my own theme, ran in to an issue, and Marcelo has responded back with very detailed, quick help. I don't know how he does it! (...) Marcelo has laid this course out well, when you come up to a snag do everything you can to research and fix it on your own, but if you can't he's there for you. That's huge for me and may be for you, too.\" </em>(Ryan Johnson)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ok... Does this course really work?</strong></p><p>Yes. Many students who have been through this course have already got jobs, or are self-employed earning a good income. Again, I will let students who have been through the course answer this question:</p><p><br></p><p><em>\"Excellent course! It teaches in a practical and simple way, easy to understand. Teacher Marcelo is great, and answers questions quickly too! Thanks to the course I even got a job as a Wordpress Theme Developer! </em>(Robson Henrique Rodrigues)</p><p><em>\"One of the best courses I've done in my life! (...) Because of this course, I got an opportunity in my job that earned me a raise! I'm very happy and fulfilled working with something I'm passionate about, which is WordPress programming. I recommend this course and Marcelo's others to everyone!\" </em>(Rebeca M.)</p><p><em>\"Today I can consider myself a Wordpress theme developer. Sometimes I can't believe it! I recommend the course to anyone who wants to start or deepen in the creation of themes for Wordpress.\" </em>(Clodoaldo Rodrigues de Sousa)</p><p><em>\"It was an extremely good and pleasant surprise to have taken this course. It exceeded my expectations thanks to the teacher and his teaching methodology. This course has, without a doubt, changed my career as a developer.\" </em>(Bruno Chirelli)</p><p><em>\"I came to this course when I needed to update a client's front end and I didn't know anything about WordPress. I got a great result on the gig, learned how to create well organized, interactive themes and significant updates to existing themes. Marcelo is a very conscientious instructor, explains in a simple way and is always willing to solve students' doubts.\"</em> (Daniel Brenner Moura)</p><p><em>\"Thank you! It was a great course, it has never been cheaper to learn so much relevant content.\" </em>(Ricardo Rodrigues de Lima)</p><p><br></p><p>So, are you ready? You can always watch the free lessons from the course before you make your decision. Remember, this is a Udemy course, so you have nothing to lose. You can count on our 100% money back guarantee within 30 days if you don't like it. So there's no reason for you not to enroll right now.</p><p>I know this is everything you've been looking for for a long time. So enroll right now and let's start this fantastic journey together.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course is designed to teach students the fundamental concepts and skills needed to build modern, responsive web pages. The course covers key topics including the basic structure of a web page, building mobile responsive web apps, working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax, and building various web components using these languages.<br><br>First, students learn the structure of a web page and how to create mobile responsive sites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This will include an introduction to HTML, which is the markup language used to create basic web page structure. Students will learn various HTML elements and how to use them to create headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and other static content.<br><br>Next, students explore CSS, the language used for styling and layout customization. CSS works in conjunction with HTML to create visually appealing site designs that stand out. Here, students learn to effectively use CSS selectors, properties, and values. This will include an introduction to responsive web design and using CSS media queries to create web pages that adapt to different screen sizes.<br><br>In addition to learning the basics of HTML and CSS, students will also learn JavaScript, the programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. Students will learn the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to use JavaScript to dynamically manipulate page elements. We also explore JavaScript events, loops, arrays, and other programming concepts.<br><br>The course will also cover more advanced topics such as building navigation components using HTML, creating forms using the post vs. get method, and working with DIVs, and IDs. We also cover styling images, backgrounds, borders, and text on top of images in CSS. Students will learn the different CSS positioning options (static, relative, absolute, fixed, float) and how to use them to create complex web page layouts. <br><br>In the JavaScript section of the course, students learn the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to use JavaScript to manipulate the elements of a web page. Here we explore, events, loops, arrays, and other programming concepts such as operator precedence, objects, and functions.</p><p>Once students have a handle on the foundational three languages, we dive into React JS – a powerful JavaScript library used for building stylish, dynamic web applications and UI components. Through a series of hands-on projects, students will build a fully functional connect-4 game, a calculator, and an e-commerce site complete with categories, checkout features, and more. <br><br>This course is designed for students with little or no previous experience in web development, but it can also be beneficial for students who have some experience and are looking to improve their skills. With the knowledge and skills gained in this course, students will be prepared to take on more advanced web development projects and to continue learning about new web development technologies.</p>",

  "description": "<p>WordPress has revolutionized the way we build websites. No more tedious long coding practices, but rather you can now select or unselect the items you want on your website. The more complex the website, the simpler the codes.</p>\n\n<p>Although creating a website in today’s day and age has become easier, making it unique and different has become even more difficult. If you don’t want your website to become lost in the sea of websites, you will have to make it stand out.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Themes are one way you can do that, the more interactive and interesting your website is, the more attention it will garner. WordPress websites are currently some of the most popular websites on the internet. If you have a basic idea of how to code or know how write in PHP, HTML5 and CSS, well then this course can definitely get you started on your road to creating fantastic new themes for your next website. Do you want to learn WordPress Themes?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course will combine your basic knowledge of HTML 5, CSS and PHP and will show you how you use the different APIs and widgets from WordPress to create awesome new themes.

He will break down the each theme step by step, and will help you learn how to incorporate the different WordPress functions into your website to make it shine.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The 10 different projects will include: Simple Theme, Advance Theme, Photo Gallery, Wordstrap, Ecommerce Theme, Business Theme, Cleancut Theme, WPNews, FourCorners, and Dynamo Theme.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The first theme will cover the basic fundamentals such as how to write the syntax and create the file structure. Every theme after that will include more complex design principles and will use the functions mentioned above.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>No more boring theory based learning, no lectures that drone on. Here’s a comprehensive lecture that will make learning fun again. You will not only learn, but actually have fun while learning.

Born from a collaboration between Instagram and Facebook : React<br><br>React is a Javascript library used to create web interfaces.

They are very often combined.<br><br>We will apply everything you'll learn in these videos through real example and real web apps.<br> Also, for each video you will watch, there will be a <strong>correction available, to make it easier for you to follow.<br></strong><br>Finally these courses are specifically designed to be <strong>accessible </strong>and<strong> easy to understand</strong>, with a <strong>lot of schema and examples, </strong>so, you don't need to be an algorithm killer or 15 years of experience developper to understand it. <strong>It's made for all.<br></strong><br>I will explain what I know assuming that you don't now React nor Redux at all.</p><p><br></p><p><strong># # #</strong></p><p><strong><br>Also learn the Typescript language ! <br><br></strong>I recently added an entire subcourse into this one, to learn Typescript, and how to use is with React.<br><strong>TypeScript</strong> was developed by Microsoft and has become a <strong>reference in the JavaScript community.</strong> <br><br>TypeScript is the language or rather the layer that <strong>can be added to</strong> a JavaScript project (such as <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>Vue</strong>, <strong>Node.JS, Electron</strong>, and many other great technologies).<br><br> It gives you access to everything that JavaScript can do, so <strong>you don't lose anything</strong> <strong>and you can do a lot more!</strong><br><br><strong>Any respectable JavaScript project,</strong> regardless of the framework or library used, <strong>utilizes TypeScript</strong>. <br>This is even more true, especially <strong>in the professional world</strong>.<br><strong><br></strong>And off course, all of that :&nbsp; in a <strong>good mood </strong>and teached in a <strong>casual way</strong> !<br><br><br><strong>* Summary *</strong></p><p><br></p><p>- <strong>React + Redux</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p> -- Setup a React 18 project with tools like \"Create React App\" or \"Vite\"</p></li><li><p> -- Setup Redux with Redux Toolkit</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;-- Components</p></li><li><p> -- States</p></li><li><p> -- Props</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;-- Hooks ( useEffect, useContexts, useRef, useNavigation, useRoute, useSelector, useDispatch, useMemo)</p></li><li><p>-- Contexts</p></li><li><p>-- Refs</p></li><li><p>-- Forms and validations</p></li><li><p>--&nbsp;Authentification +&nbsp;Signup with Firebase</p></li><li><p>--&nbsp;Using Firebase Firestore as real time back-end </p></li><li><p>-- Navigation with React router</p></li><li><p>-- Callback functions</p></li><li><p>-- ES6 functions (map, reduce, filter)</p></li><li><p>-- Styling (css modules, JSS, Bootstrap)</p></li><li><p>-- Understand NPM</p></li><li><p>-- Write in Redux store</p></li><li><p>-- Read from Redux</p></li><li><p>-- Understanding slices,actions reducers</p></li><li><p>-- Redux middlewares</p></li><li><p>-- Make redux persistent to keep your data even after refreshing</p></li><li><p>-- Set up a fake server with Json-server</p></li><li><p>-- Asynchronous requests</p></li><li><p>-- React app deployment on the web</p></li><li><p>-- Testing with Jest and React testing library</p></li><li><p>-- Custom hooks</p></li><li><p>-- Make your app support multiples languages with i18n</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>- <strong>The Typescript language</strong> </p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Primitives types and how to use them</p></li><li><p>How the TypeScript compiler works</p></li><li><p>Classes with TypeScript</p></li><li><p>Functions, default and optionals parameters</p></li><li><p>Objects</p></li><li><p>Arrays</p></li><li><p>Object oriented programming</p></li><li><p>Namespaces and modules</p></li><li><p>Interfaces</p></li><li><p>Enumerations</p></li><li><p>Access modifier</p></li><li><p>Types</p></li><li><p>Type casting</p></li><li><p>Generics</p></li><li><p>Decorators</p></li></ul><p>- <strong>&nbsp;A complete React +&nbsp;Typescript project</strong>&nbsp; :<br></p><ul><li><p>Create a Vite +&nbsp;React +&nbsp;Typescript project</p></li><li><p>Build a full React +&nbsp;TS web app !</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>And much much more incoming soon.</p><p>See you soon !<br>Codiku.</p><p><br></p>",

Once downloaded, open Virtualbox, follow the steps to create a Ubuntu VM, select the .iso from your hard drive, install Ubuntu and you&#039;re good to go with all the commands mentioned in this course. The only extra command I&#039;ve had so far to install pip is &#039;sudo apt-get install python-setuptools&#039;.&quot; -- Harry  </p>  <h5>FAQ (Doubters Read This)</h5>  <p>  \t                    1) I am not technical at all, are you sure I should take this class?There was a time you didn&#039;t know how to read, or write, or speak, or walk, or... I believe you are not technical because you didn&#039;t take the time to learn through the hard times OR because you haven&#039;t even tried. Coding For Entrepreneurs has a growing community to help you through the tough times, the Instructor will help, the Django Community is incredible, and often times a simple web search will solve your problem. Getting help is easier than EVER and often comes for free.  </p>  <p>  \t                    2) Is Django actually that good? It&#039;s the default choice for Instagram, Mozilla, Pinterest, Disqus, and many, many more. Django is lightweight, super flexible, easy to learn, easy to implement. I believe it&#039;s that good.  </p>  <p>  \t                    3) What makes Python a good language for beginners? Python looks closest to the English language next to many other programming languages and therefore is easier to learn. Python uses spaces &quot; &quot; more often than &quot;;&quot; or &quot;$&quot; or &quot;{&quot; or &quot;(&quot; like PHP and Ruby use.  </p>  <p>  \t                    4) I already know PHP (or another language), should I learn Python/Django? There are two schools of thought: 1) Yes because it&#039;s awesome and makes it easy to implemented web-based projects or 2) No because you don&#039;t really need to know more than 1 language. If there is any feeling of desire to learn more, do it.  </p>  <p>  \t                    5) Why don&#039;t I just use Wordpress or another platform? I think this is like asking a chef why he doesn&#039;t follow someone else&#039;s recipe. The other recipe might be fantastic... but it&#039;s still following a recipe. A true chef creates. A cook follows. Using a platform can be great...but to truly innovate, you need to know how to do it yourself.  </p>  <p>  \t6) I see that Django version 1.6 and Python 2.7 is what is used... isn&#039;t Python 3.4 and Django 1.7 out? Why aren&#039;t you using those versions? Yes both are out and both are very solid on their own. There is much debate about Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 as to which to use. Mac and Linux come standard with Python 2.7 so we believe it&#039;s still a solid choice and will remain that way until these major operating systems change what they use. Django 1.7 vs 1.6 (or even 1.5) is virtually the same; especially for a beginner. Once you understand Django, you understand Django. Regardless of the version until Django releases a huge overhaul (which won&#039;t happen anytime soon).  </p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you looking for a <strong>complete web development course</strong> that takes you from <strong>beginner to advanced</strong>? This <strong>6-in-1 Web Developer Bootcamp</strong> is the <em>only course you’ll need</em> to learn web development from the ground up. </p><p>We cover everything in one comprehensive package: <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, <strong>JavaScript (ES6+)</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap 5</strong>, <strong>Python 3</strong>, and <strong>Django</strong>. You’ll learn step-by-step in a beginner-friendly manner and build real projects to reinforce each skill. Every section is designed for absolute beginners, so <strong>no prior experience is necessary</strong>. <em>(Even if you have some coding experience, you’ll discover plenty of advanced tips and modern best practices to level up your skills.)</em> </p><p>By the end of this course, you’ll have the knowledge and confidence to create your own websites and <strong>full-stack web applications</strong> from scratch.</p><p><strong>Up-to-date and Cutting-Edge:</strong> <br>We keep the content fresh and relevant with the <strong>latest web standards</strong>. (Last updated August 2025) The HTML5 and CSS3 sections have been refreshed to include new features like responsive images using the &lt;picture&gt; tag and &lt;figure&gt; captions, modern CSS layouts with Flexbox and CSS Grid, and advanced CSS selectors. </p><p>You’ll also learn how to build responsive pages <strong>without relying on frameworks</strong>, so you understand core concepts of Responsive Web Design. <em>(June 2023 Update:</em> The Bootstrap section has been upgraded to <strong>Bootstrap 5.3</strong>, ensuring you’re learning the most current tools for building responsive sites.) </p><p>We use <strong>Django</strong> for the back-end, so you’ll be working with the latest version of this powerful Python framework. All the code and techniques are aligned with 2025 industry standards, so you’re learning <strong>modern web development</strong> practices from day one.</p><p><strong>HTML5 &amp; CSS3 – Foundations:</strong> <br>Start with the building blocks of the web. In the HTML5 &amp; CSS3 module, you’ll learn how to structure pages with semantic HTML and style them with CSS. We cover all the essential HTML tags – headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables, forms, iframes, and more – and how to bring them to life with CSS styling. </p><p>Through a dedicated project, you’ll <strong>build a complete website from scratch</strong> to practice your skills. Along the way, you’ll understand proper page structure, organize your files, and learn to embed media. We also dive into making your site <strong>responsive</strong> and mobile-friendly using CSS3 techniques. </p><p>By learning concepts like the <strong>CSS Box Model</strong>, Flexbox, and media queries, you’ll be able to create layouts that look great on any device. This strong foundation in HTML/CSS will set you up for success in all subsequent sections.</p><p><strong>Modern JavaScript – Make Your Sites Interactive:</strong> <br>Next, you’ll make your websites dynamic and interactive with JavaScript. We start from scratch – perfect for beginners – explaining variables, data types, functions, loops, and more in a simple, practical way. You’ll learn how to use JavaScript to <strong>manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model)</strong>, which lets you change webpage content and styles on the fly. </p><p>We cover debugging techniques to help you fix errors and write cleaner code. Plus, you’ll get up to speed with <strong>modern ES2021 features</strong> (ECMAScript 2021), so you can write JavaScript using the latest syntax and best practices. To make the learning concrete, you’ll build useful features like a <strong>live form validation</strong> script, giving you hands-on experience in adding real interactivity to a webpage. </p><p>By the end of this module, you’ll be comfortable with core JavaScript programming and able to create richer web user experiences.</p><p><strong>Responsive Design &amp; Bootstrap 5 – Professional Front-End Development:</strong> <br>After mastering the basics of CSS and JavaScript, you’ll move on to Bootstrap 5, one of the most popular front-end frameworks. Bootstrap 5 will turbocharge your ability to create beautiful, responsive layouts quickly. You’ll learn how to use the Bootstrap grid system, components (like navbars, cards, modals), and utility classes to build modern web pages with less effort. We’ll solidify your learning by building <strong>three separate projects</strong> using Bootstrap: an <strong>Employee Management System</strong> interface, a <strong>Blog website</strong>, and a <strong>Professional portfolio site</strong>. </p><p>Each project is designed to show you how to implement real-world features – from multi-column layouts and forms to navigation menus and image galleries – using Bootstrap’s pre-built styles and scripts. (<em>All project files are included</em> so you can follow along and review the code.) By completing these projects, you’ll not only understand Bootstrap in depth but also reinforce your knowledge of responsive design and front-end best practices. Your websites will be mobile-friendly and look professionally designed – a key skill for any web developer.</p><p><strong>Python 3 – Back-End Programming Made Easy:</strong> <br>With the front-end taken care of, it’s time to dive into back-end development using Python. Python is a powerful yet beginner-friendly programming language, and we’ll teach it assuming you have no prior coding experience. In this section, you’ll learn Python 3 fundamentals: how to set up your development environment, write simple programs, and gradually tackle more complex concepts. </p><p>We cover <strong>data structures</strong> (lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.), control flow (loops and conditionals), functions, and even the basics of <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong> in Python. You’ll also practice working with files and modules, so you can organize larger programs. Each concept is demonstrated with examples relevant to web development, preparing you to use Python for building web apps. </p><p>By the end of the Python module, you’ll have a solid grasp of programming logic and syntax, which will pave the way for learning Django and server-side development.</p><p><strong>Django – Full-Stack Web Development:</strong> <br>Finally, you’ll bring everything together by learning Django, a popular Python web framework that powers the back-end of many modern websites. We start by guiding you through setting up a Django project and understanding its MVC-style architecture. You’ll learn how to create Django apps, define models for your database, and run migrations to set up those database tables. </p><p>We even show you how to create an admin/superuser account and customize the <strong>Django admin panel</strong> with filters – so you can easily manage your site’s data. With Django, you’ll build two major projects from scratch: a <strong>full-featured Employee Management System (EMS) web application</strong> and a dynamic <strong>Portfolio website</strong>. </p><p>Through these projects, you’ll get hands-on experience with URL routing, creating views and templates, and linking everything to a database. You’ll discover how to serve static files (like images, CSS, and JavaScript) in Django, and use Django’s template language &amp; tags to display dynamic content elegantly. </p><p>By completing the Django module, you will have developed a true <strong>full-stack web application</strong> using Python – covering front-end, back-end, and database integration. This is where you transform into an <strong>advanced web developer</strong>, capable of creating your own web apps from idea to deployment.</p><p>This course is packed with <strong>practical exercises and projects</strong> to ensure you not only watch but also <em>learn by doing</em>. You’ll build a portfolio of websites and applications that you can showcase to potential employers or clients. Throughout the course, our approach is friendly and hands-on – we explain the <em>why</em> behind each concept, not just the how, so you gain a deeper understanding of web development.</p><p>Whether you’re completely new to coding or looking to upgrade your skills, this course provides a one-stop solution. It’s <strong>beginner-friendly</strong>, but also rich with <strong>advanced content</strong> for those already familiar with the basics. </p><p>By enrolling in this bootcamp, you’re making an investment in yourself – by the end, you’ll have a broad and robust skill set in <strong>full-stack web development</strong>. </p><p>Get ready to build awesome websites and web apps! </p><p><strong>Join us now</strong> and start your journey to becoming a confident, job-ready web developer.</p>",

Or maybe you are a web development enthusiast looking to <strong>conver</strong><strong>t</strong> PSD designs into fully functional websites? Or just a beginner web developer/designer who is looking forward to <strong>learn</strong> how PSD and HTML5/CSS3 work together?<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, PSD to HTML5 conversion is a <strong>MUST-HAV</strong><strong>E</strong> skill for any aspiring or experienced web developer/designer out there.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This PSD to HTML5 conversion course will take you from a <em>complete</em> beginner to a <strong>knowledgeable develope</strong><strong>r</strong> who is feeling comfortable converting PSD designs into fully functional and responsive HTML5 websites.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This is a lot more than PSD-to-HTML course. It is one of the most <strong>comprehensive</strong> web design/development courses out there as its very content-rich and features a lot of topics. We’ll start of with Photoshop and learn what are the <em>basic starting steps</em> of converting a PSD design into a HTML5 website. We will firstly understand and study the PSD design and after that slice it, cut it and collect the images. Then we’ll start <strong>coding</strong> our HTML5 markup to prepare the development of the website.<br><br>During the development stage, we'll <strong>learn</strong> a lot of things when styling our design: floats, positioning, width, custom columns, fluid design, full-width backgrounds <em>AND MORE</em>!!!\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- We’ll be creating stunning animations <em>FROM SCRATCH</em> including an iPhone turn-on animation that looks very slick. We’ll use various famous libraries to create the remaining breathtaking animations on scroll and polish our website to the maximum. However, that’s not all.<br> We’ll then dive into creating our website <strong>responsive</strong> to fit any screen size and mobile device. We will be <strong>coding</strong> <strong>CUSTOM media queries to control the behavior</strong> of our website on smaller screens. I’ll be guiding you through a way to create a <strong>responsive navigation bar</strong> menu from scratch using basic programming techniques. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll then jump into a brand new section that will get updated over time and which will include special tips and <strong>advanced techniques</strong> to convert problematic PSD designs into working websites.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course you will take a finished PSD design and learn how to <strong>convert</strong> it to create a fully responsive HTML5 page with pure CSS3 from SCRATCH. No responsive frameworks like Bootstrap! (My earlier course covers that!) \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that the only way to become a <strong>successful student</strong> of this course is through practice and involvement. That’s why you will be presented with quizzes and interactive questions throughout the course. After completing, you will be challenged to take a PSD design, use the skills that you’ve gained in this course and create a breathtaking HTML5 responsive website that you will be proud of!\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So, what are you waiting for?

  "description": "<p><strong>React &amp; Flux Course Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>Welcome to React and Flux Web Development for Beginners.</p>\n\n<p>This course is designed for developers who know basic HTML and CSS but who want to take their skills to the next level by building data-driven web apps - the kind of apps that can be used for products or startups and the type of apps that can interact with servers.</p>\n\n<p>The course is also for developers of any level who want to know and master React and Flux.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why React?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Why should you learn React js instead of Angular or Backbone or Ember or Meteor? One reason is because React is incredibly minimalistic. It focuses on reusable view components. <strong>Never</strong> have to copy and paste code again with React. Then take the Reflux design architecture and mix it with React js and you have a full-stack front-end solution that is very lightweight. Frameworks like Angular do a LOT of things, are very heavyweight, and have steep learning curves. Why use a framework that gives you stuff you don't need in every project?</p>\n\n<p>React was created by Facebook, designed incredibly well, and makes fantastic data-driven websites. React Flux is a powerful combination.</p>\n\n<p><strong>React &amp; Flux Course Content</strong><br></p>\n\n<p>You are going to learn a lot in this course. Here are some of the topics we cover:</p>\n\n<ul><li>React Components and component nesting</li><li>React Component user interaction with states</li><li>React Component data management with props</li><li>Robust architectures with Flux and Reflux</li><li>Building simple Node &amp; Express servers</li><li>Making HTTP requests and managing data in React</li><li>In-line React styling with Javascript</li><li>Parsing and managing JSON in React</li><li>Single page applications with React Router</li><li>Javascript overview</li><li>Professional development practices and tips</li></ul>\n\n<p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Seems like everyday you can find a news story about a security breach, which can be devastating to companies. </p><p>Clearly, security is a very important topic.</p><p>The Spring Framework is the most popular Java framework for building cloud scale applications. </p><p><strong>Spring Security </strong>provides you all the tools you need to secure your Java application. </p><p>Application security is much more than allowing access after checking a user name and password. You will learn how to limit what application features a user may or may not see. And also, how to limit what data a user may or may not see.</p><p>This course focuses on the core fundamentals of <strong>Spring Security</strong>. </p><p>Central to Spring Security is the process of Authentication. This is the process of establishing a user's identity.&nbsp; </p><p>Once a user's identity is established, the process of Authorization is used to allow the user to access specific actions and features of an application. </p><p>Spring Security has a very robust toolset for Authentication and Authorization. </p><p>Inside this course, you will master both. </p><p>You will start the course by learning how to leverage the auto-configuration capabilities of Spring Boot to quickly secure a web application using HTTP&nbsp;Basic Authentication. </p><p>Then, you'll be lead through a series of exercises, to replace and customize the default Spring Boot auto-configuration. </p><p>Through this process, you will understand the Spring Boot hidden 'magic', and learn how to master the configuration of Spring Security.&nbsp; </p><p>You will be working with a typical Spring Boot Web Application. The application mimics a robust monolithic application - with web pages and RESTful endpoints. This allows us to explore the unique security aspects unique to both web applications and RESTFul APIs.</p><p>You may notice there is not a dedicated section of the course about Testing Spring Security. This is because testing is done throughout the course.</p><p>Test Driven Development (TDD) is widely considered a best practice in software engineering. </p><p>As we explore the features of Spring Security, we will follow a TDD&nbsp;approach. </p><p>We will first write a failing test using JUnit 5, Mockito, and Spring MockMVC, then complete the lesson objective to get a passing test.</p><p>You will see some great examples of testing Spring with JUnit 5. However, it is recommended you have prior experience with JUnit 5. </p><p>In this course, you will learn:</p><ul><li><p>HTTP&nbsp;Basic Authentication with Spring Security</p></li><li><p>Spring Security Java Configuration</p></li><li><p>Using an In-Memory Authentication Provider</p></li><li><p>Using Spring Security for Password Management </p></li><li><p>Best Practices for Password Security</p></li><li><p>Creating Custom Authentication Filters</p></li><li><p>Using a database with Spring Data JPA&nbsp;for Authentication</p></li><li><p>User Roles with Spring Security</p></li><li><p>User Authorities with Spring Security</p></li><li><p>Multitenancy Security </p></li><li><p>Configure Spring Security for CSRF Protection</p></li><li><p>Create a custom login form</p></li><li><p>Using Remember Me </p></li><li><p>How to lock out users after too many failed attempts </p></li><li><p>How to unlock accounts automatically after a period of time</p></li><li><p>CORS&nbsp;with Spring Security</p></li></ul><p><strong>Course Extra - IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate</strong></p><p>Students enrolling in the course can receive a <strong>free 120 day trial license</strong> to IntelliJ&nbsp;IDEA&nbsp;Ultimate! Get hands on experience using&nbsp;the Java IDE&nbsp;preferred by Spring Framework professionals!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Course Extra - Access to a Private Slack Community</strong></p><p>You're not just enrolling in a course --&gt; <em>You are joining a community learning about Spring Security.</em></p><p>With your enrollment to the course, you can access an exclusive Slack community. Get help from the instructor and other Spring Framework Gurus from around the world - in real time! <em>This community is only available to students enrolled in this course.&nbsp;</em></p><p>With your enrollment, you can join this <strong>community</strong> of awesome gurus!</p><p><strong>Closed Captioning / Subtitles</strong></p><p>Closed captioning in English&nbsp;is available for all course videos!</p><p><strong>PDF&nbsp;Downloads</strong></p><p>All keynote presentations are available for you to download as PDFs.</p><p><strong>Lifetime Access</strong></p><p>When you purchase this course, you will receive lifetime access!

  "description": "<p>JavaScript is the language of the internet. Learning it has allowed many front and backend web developers to get jobs. Yet JavaScript’s newest features can be confusing and hard to understand.</p><p>Nearly 200,000 students have learned from my course \"<strong>JavaScript:&nbsp;Understanding the Weird Parts</strong>\" which so many tell me formed the foundation of their careers today, and they still review yearly. <strong>This is the <em>sequel</em>, continuing your JavaScript education and diving into even more advanced concepts, under-the-hood!</strong></p><p>In this course you will learn to deeply understand how modern advanced JavaScript language features work under-the-hood, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Block Scoping (let and const)</p></li><li><p>Templates</p></li><li><p>Classes</p></li><li><p>Arrow Functions</p></li><li><p>Symbols</p></li><li><p>Iterators and Iterables</p></li><li><p>Default Parameters</p></li><li><p>Rest and Spread</p></li></ul><p>ES6 and beyond refers to features added to the JavaScript language in ES6 and ES Next. These features often will make your coding life easier, and are used by modern JavaScript frameworks, like React, Vue, Angular, and more.</p><p>As always, these topics will be covered with the focus on my core philosophy:&nbsp;\"Don't Imitate, Understand\". You won't try to learn by imitating the code I'm writing, but rather by deeply understanding how these language features work inside JavaScript engines. Deeply understanding means you will not only write better code, but also find it much easier to debug problems.</p><p>This course’s goal, then, is to help you have a deep understanding of JavaScript’s newest features. Through analysis of the inner working of the JavaScript engine, you can write code more confidentially and fix problems others find difficult.</p><p>It’s time for you to deeply understand advanced JavaScript concepts!</p><p>Happy coding!</p><p>- Tony Alicea</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Foundations Certification Course. </p><p>In this course we will explore AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). </p><p>IAM is a very important part of understanding how to securely and efficiently manage the services and users within an AWS&nbsp;account. </p><p>As defined by AWS, <em>“AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.”</em></p><p>When creating an AWS account, the default account is the Root account. This root account has complete access to all AWS services and resources on the account. The root account should only be used to perform a few account and service management tasks.</p><p>Each service deployed in an AWS&nbsp;account should only be accessible to users permitted to use the service. </p><p><strong>This course will explore the following components of IAM with hands-on exercises:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Allowing multiple users to administer the resources in an AWS account without having to share passwords. <br></p></li><li><p>Creating granular permissions for AWS users. This means each IAM user can be granted a different level of privileges for different resources in the AWS account. <br></p></li><li><p>Applying IAM&nbsp;credentials to applications, thus providing the application with access to specified AWS services. <br></p></li><li><p>Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for individual IAM&nbsp;Users.<br></p></li><li><p>Enabling access records and logging for IAM&nbsp;Users using AWS&nbsp;CloutTrail. </p></li></ul><p>If you are interested in learning how to securely manage an AWS&nbsp;account using IAM, hit the enroll button and let's get started. </p>",

  "description": "<p>Django and Python can seem overwhelming at first, but they don't have to be! In this course I’ll walk you through it step by step and you’ll be building your first web app in MINUTES. You’ll be amazed how quick and easy it is to create very professional looking websites, even if you have no programming or web design experience at all.<br></p>\n\n<p>Watch over my shoulder as I build a cool To-Do List app step by step right in front of you. You’ll follow along and build your own copy. By the time we’re finished, you’ll have a solid understanding of Django and how to use it to build awesome web apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course contains 28 videos – and is just over 2 hours long.

  "description": "<p><strong>Important note:</strong>&nbsp;This course was made in 2017 when <strong>classes</strong> were the primary model for React and ES6 was new. Since then, the model has changed substantially to focus on functional programming (<strong>hooks</strong>). Smaller, but important changes like using next.js, redux-tool-kit, etc. have also gotten traction. I&nbsp;do cover hooks in both React and Redux (react-redux module), but the course is focused around the older model. It still works, it's just \"outdated\" as current React goes. Please be aware of that if you are new, and if you prefer a class based model, then this might be exactly what you are looking for.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>This course:</strong></p><p>Starting with Angular 1 in 2010, JavaScript frameworks exploded onto the scene and are <strong>required</strong> by virtually every large website on the Internet. React, which appeared a few years later in 2013&nbsp; has become the dominant tool in that group. What does that mean for you? You can learn to use the same front-end framework used by Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, BBC, Airbnb, and Ebay, to name a few. And you won't just learn how to use it, but you'll learn the fundamentals around it.</p><p>TL;DR - React is awesome. I've been teaching it professionally for 8 years and love it. Learn it here!</p><p><strong>What I&nbsp;need from you:</strong></p><ul><li><p>I need you to know JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. </p></li><li><p>It's not required to use React, but React makes very heavy use of ES6 (the 2015 update to JavaScript), so the course will use ES6 after the first main section. I will briefly mention how it works as needed, and add a supplemental section that covers those parts.</p></li><li><p>I&nbsp;need you know how to navigate your computer, not be afraid of the terminal, and ask questions as you have them! </p></li></ul><p><strong>Why me:</strong></p><p>I first used React in 2014 for a small company website. I've also used Angular, Vue, and Ember along with most other major UI frameworks and I'm a believer in React. I've taught it professionally for 4 years, and have built sites for some of the largest companies in the United States using React Router and redux alongside. I&nbsp;will teach you one step at a time, whiteboard, and start from ground zero before getting to webpack and eventually Redux. Prepare to start learning <strong>the best JavaScript framework</strong>!</p><p>The sections in bold will be finished no later than August 15.

How about gaining heaps of practical knowledge about working with Amazon Web Services (AWS)?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Prepare to get excited about this course!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>AWS has over a million customers, some of which are the most popular websites in the world. You can be sure that AWS will be a great fit for your web application regardless of what scale you're running at.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One awesome thing about using AWS</strong> is that a ton of companies are hiring people who have experience with it. All of the knowledge you gain from this course can be used to apply for DevOps or cloud computing positions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The main AWS component that you'll learn about in this course is Amazon ECS, which is the Amazon EC2 Container Service. It's Amazon's take on how to manage a cluster of Docker containers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The first section of this course</strong> will concentrate on getting familiar with AWS and then performing a deep dive on Amazon ECS where you'll learn everything there is to know about it. You'll also get familiar with Amazon ECR which is Amazon's private Docker registry.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>During this deep dive there will be plenty of guided labs to get your hands dirty.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The second section of this course</strong> will be all about Dockerizing a multi-service Ruby on Rails application, as well as profiling that application with Docker and other open source tools.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you're not a developer or have no intentions of using Ruby on Rails that's fine because you can skip the development section. The only thing you'll have to do is build the Docker image, which will be as simple as running a few commands.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The third section of this course</strong> will be taking the knowledge learned from previous sections and deploying the application to production on AWS in a fault tolerant way.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You'll learn how to calculate costs for a real life project hosted on AWS and load balance the web application so you can scale out to as many hosts as you need.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way you'll learn about many other AWS resources and also learn how to hook up a domain name to a load balancer and secure it with a free SSL certificate.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>This entire course is very hands on</em>, with just enough theory to understand the main goal -- which is to get you comfortable scaling your web apps with Docker on AWS.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>\"Excellent teacher and great material - easy to follow and informative.

  "description": "<p><strong>Svelte is a JavaScript framework that allows you to build state driven components.</strong> However what makes Svelte different from other frameworks like Angular, React and Vue; is that Svelte is a compiler. Svelte runs at build time. Which means your Svelte code will be compiled at build time into highly efficient imperative code that runs on the browser to carry out DOM operations. Other famous frameworks usually use a technique called the virtual DOM to decide how to update the DOM. This technique runs in the browser during run time. And that adds more overhead to the DOM calculations.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>In this course we are going to learn everything about Svelte from scratch. </strong>We are going to start with the basics of signal based reactivity and we then we will create simple components. And then gradually progress and create more complex components and discuss more in depth features. </p><p><br></p><p>And while Svelte is a great tool to build components for the web, it's not an easy task to build an entire full stack application with just Svelte. That's why we have SvelteKit. <strong>SvelteKit is a framework for rapid development of robust, performant web applications. </strong>SvelteKit provides us out of the box with things like routing, server side rendering, pre-rendering and more. It provides us with a structure that we can follow to build high performance applications that are server side rendered and progressively enhanced.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>In this course we are going to learn everything about SvelteKit</strong>. We are going to discuss pages and layouts, loading data, hooks, error handling, environment variables, pre-rendering, progressively enhanced form actions and more.</p><p><br></p><p>We are also going to use tools like PostgreSQL &amp; Drizzle ORM for database management and BetterAuth and CASL for authentication and authorization.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>So join now if you want to build high performance web applications with Svelte &amp; SvelteKit!</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>This course covers in-depth the Typescript language and includes several practical projects. It comes with a running Github repo.</p><p><strong>This Course in a Nutshell</strong></p><p>One of the biggest novelties in the Javascript frontend development space in the last few years is that the <strong>use of Typescript has become almost universal</strong>.</p><p>To the point that it almost does not make sense anymore to start a new project and <em>not</em> use Typescript, given its huge advantages, and almost no downsides.</p><p>And this includes projects not only in <strong>Node, but also in React, Angular</strong>, and any other Javascript-based frontend framework.</p><p>Typescript is a strongly typed language that is a superset of Javascript, meaning that Javascript programs are valid Typescript programs (depending on the settings we use for the compiler), but not the other way around.</p><p>So in a nutshell, this means that you can see <strong>Typescript as a better and improved version of Javascript.</strong></p><p>But even though superficially similar, Typescript due to its powerful type system is actually a completely different language than Javascript.</p><p>The static type system of Typescript provides many advantages as it allows us to catch many program errors at development instead of at runtime, and it enables powerful development tooling such as precise auto-completion and different types of refactoring.</p><p>But to benefit from the power of the type system, we actually <em>don't</em> have to add type annotations everywhere and end up with code that looks like Java or C#, and sacrifice flexibility, development speed and readability.</p><p>The type system can automatically infer the types of most variables automatically, without us having to declare them explicitly, meaning that we can essentially write type-safe Javascript-like code with minimal type annotations.</p><p>This powerful type inference is really the killer language feature that makes Typescript the preferred way of starting both a frontend and a backend project today: we get all the benefits of a static type system essentially for free, with no downsides.</p><p><strong>Course Overview</strong></p><p>This course is divided into multiple sections, that you can take directly depending on your previous level of familiarity with the language. So there are <strong>multiple learning paths available</strong> for you, depending on your previous experience.</p><p>The course will start with a deep dive into all the language features starting with the most basic ones but covering also in detail the most advanced features.</p><p>So if you are already familiar with some of the features you can skip ahead, and focus only on the features that you aren't aware of yet.</p><p>We will present the language features from the most elementary ones to the most advanced, and we will cover first the features that are most commonly used.</p><p>For completeness, we will also cover a lot of features that are rarely used, but we will point that out explicitly, especially if it's a feature that you are very unlikely to ever use while coding at the application level.</p><p>Besides the language features, we are going to dedicate a full section to the configuration of the Typescript compiler, and go over every option you have available.</p><p>We will make it clear when a compiler feature is rarely needed when compared with features that you will be using all the time.</p><p>We will still cover everything for completeness, but we want to give you the option to focus only on the most commonly used compiler options if that is what you prefer.</p><p>After this initial section covering all language features, we are going to cover also in detail <strong>Object-oriented programming, Generics and Decorators</strong>, each in their own section.</p><p>These 3 sections are mostly independent of the rest of the course and can be taken separately.</p><p>After the language sections, we enter the part of the course that covers practical projects.</p><p>These <strong>practical projects are as close to what you would develop in the real world</strong> as possible. This means that these are still small projects that you can comfortably build without spending too much time, but they contain all the building blocks and illustrate all the same design elements that you would have to put in place in a real application.</p><p>For example, we are going to build a complete example of a <strong>REST API in Node using Typescript and TypeORM</strong>, a Typescript-friendly ORM for Node. The server will be designed will all the typical elements of a production system in mind.</p><p>For example, the API will be fully secure, and it will require the user to be properly authenticated with a JWT. The API will support multiple levels of access, from a read-only user to an admin user that can edit the data.</p><p>Next, once the backend is completed, we are going to build also a <strong>couple of frontends with Typescript, namely an Angular frontend</strong>, each one in its own separate project.</p><p>This way, you will have built your complete system (both frontend and backend) using only one single common language: Typescript.</p><p>Table of Contents</p><p>This course will go over the following topics:</p><ul><li><p>Introduction to Typescript</p></li><li><p>The Typescript Type System</p></li><li><p>The most powerful feature of Typescript: type inference</p></li><li><p>In-depth coverage of all the Typescript language features, from the most simple to the most advanced</p></li><li><p>In-depth coverage of all the features available in the Typescript compiler</p></li><li><p>Object-oriented programming</p></li><li><p>Typescript Generics in depth</p></li><li><p>Typescript Decorators in depth</p></li><li><p>Practical Typescript Project&nbsp; - Secure Node REST API with TypeORM</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>What Will You Learn In this Course?</strong></p><p>In this course, you will learn everything that you need to know to <strong>build both the backend and the frontend of your application using the same language: Typescript</strong>.</p><p>You will know all the features of the language in-depth, and you will be aware of the distinction between the features that you will be using almost every day, from the features that you will only sparingly use.</p><p>You will also know in detail the multiple features that you have available in the Typescript compiler.</p><p>You will know how to build real-world projects with Typescript, including how to develop your backend with Node and Typescript, and also how to build your frontend in Typescript using modern frameworks.</p><p>Have a look at the course free lessons below, and please enjoy the course!</p>",

It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, \"What can I do to become a better web developer faster?\" The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What is JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a curly-braced, dynamically typed, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language. It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.</p><p><strong>Why is JavaScript important?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development.</p><p><strong>What are the main uses of JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used for client- and server-side development. Web developers have used JavaScript since its inception to add simple interactivity to web pages like modals, animated elements, or image slideshows. While that is still one of its primary uses, Javascript has evolved to building complete web applications. SPAs, or single page applications, depend on JavaScript-based frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue to bring a desktop-like application experience to the browser. However, it's important to note that web browsers aren't places that make good use of the programming language. Javascript is also popular for building web services and back-end infrastructure with Node.js. React Native, Xamarin, Ionic, and NativeScript frameworks use JavaScript for developing phone apps as well.</p><p><strong>React vs. Angular vs. Vue: what is the best JavaScript framework?</strong></p><p>choosing the best JavaScript framework for your web project depends on what you are looking for. React is a popular framework, which means you will find a lot of community support if you need help. It is also considered relatively easy to learn but is being developed at a rapid pace. Angular is a framework that makes data binding easy so that you can template an application faster. It also uses the RxJS library to simplify asynchronous programming and Typescript (which compiles to JavaScript) for a cleaner, less error-prone development process. Some cons of Angular are that it can have a steep learning curve and can be complex. Vue is a lightweight framework, so it is easy to learn, very performant, and flexible. Some cons of Vue are limited plugins, and its flexibility can lead to irregular code.</p><p><strong>What is JSON and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Because of the evolution of the JavaScript language, JavaScript has a variety of techniques for creating objects. But, ultimately in the background, JavaScript is using a syntax called JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a standard text-based format used to represent objects in JavaScript. The same basic types of data represented in Javascript can also be represented in JSON, including strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, and JavaScript objects. Although JSON is based on the JavaScript object, it is not just used in JavaScript. It is also used as a format to transfer data from a web browser to a server and vice versa because of the format's simplicity and small size. The JSON format is used in REST APIs for this purpose and has replaced XML as the standard format for many APIs. Because of this, just about any language you use will have a method of converting data into JSON to interact with REST APIs.</p><p><strong>What is AJAX and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a technology that developers use to create better, faster and more interactive web applications. AJAX uses XHTML for content, CSS to style the page, and JavaScript for controlling content dynamically. AJAX allows you to update a web page without reloading the page (this technique is called a “SPA” or Single Page Application), request data for the page after it has loaded, receive data after the page has loaded, and send data to the server in the background. Despite XML being part of the acronym that makes up AJAX, AJAX can send and receive data in any format, including JSON or plain text. While traditional web applications use synchronous methods to send and receive information from a web server, AJAX can use asynchronous API calls in the background without blocking activity in the browser. AJAX is a data-driven rather than a page-driven technology.</p><p><strong>How can I teach myself Javascript?</strong></p><p>One of the best ways to learn to write code is through an online course that teaches you how to write JavaScript with an instructor that will explain the code, what versions you should use, and why. Learning to develop a real-world application, with an instructor explaining in a step-by-step fashion, will teach you modern code techniques.</p><p><strong>What is the best IDE for Javascript?</strong></p><p>With all of the different JavaScript IDEs available, the best option depends on how you intend to use it, along with your personal preferences. Webstorm is a popular JavaScript IDE from JetBrains. It provides fast static code analysis, integrated testing, local history, code refactoring, and debugging. While the IDE requires a paid subscription, many developers swear by it because of its compatibility with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Those searching for a free option might prefer VS Code. This general-purpose, open-source IDE comes with IntelliSense, Git integration, and debugging features built-in. Many third-party extensions are available to add new language and programming features, making it one of the more flexible choices. Atom is another general-purpose IDE that is popular with JavaScript developers. It is also free, open-source, and has third-party extensions to add.</p><p>Angular is an open-source, client-side framework for building single-page websites and desktop and mobile applications. It is a full-featured JavaScript application built on TypeScript, which operates across platforms and keeps code clean and consistent throughout the codebase. Angular is an all-in-one rapid application development platform that allows web pages to render efficiently by minimizing communication with servers. The Angular framework offers end-to-end tooling or routing, state management, and form validation, as well as dependency injection and declarative templates. Angular offers out-of-the-box functionality and easy updating, along with an extensive collection of pre-made components. The TypeScript base includes high-quality code that reduces the burden of debugging and allows multiple developers to collaborate across platforms with minimal disruption and less coding.</p><p><strong>Is learning Angular hard?</strong></p><p>Angular is a complex application that contains multiple libraries and cross-platform functionalities, so it can take some time to learn its many features. Angular’s learning curve depends partly on your previous knowledge of web development and your familiarity with the languages used in the Angular platform. If you’re new to Angular, it’s helpful to have some familiarity with the basics of web design and the essentials of HTML and CSS. It’s also useful to know about the other languages that make up the Angular framework. These include basic HTML and CSS, as well as ECMAScript6, or ES6, a general programming language designed to ensure interoperability of web pages across the Internet. It’s also helpful to understand TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript used to write Angular. Learning Angular is even easier if you’re familiar with JavaScript, which is an implementation of ES6 and Angular’s base language.</p><p><strong>What is Angular used for?</strong></p><p>Developers mainly use Angular to build dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) for web, mobile, and desktop. SPAs are web pages based on a single HTML file that is completely controlled by JavaScript. When an action such as clicking a button happens on the page, the code renders it on the page instantly without sending a new request to the server. TypeScript and Angular’s other tools, including routing, state management, and ROM validation, make SPA creation easy and fast. Its open-source JavaScript framework allows developers to reuse code across multiple platforms. Angular’s component-based architecture simplifies the development workflow, making it possible to design apps for deployment in a wide range of environments and update them without extensive recoding.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Angular and React?</strong></p><p>Angular and React are both rapid application development (RAD) platforms based on JavaScript. Angular is a multilayered framework that runs on Typescript and is compatible with many different code editors. It is a full-featured web development platform that requires no additional libraries. This means Angular can independently carry out a full range of development functions such as data binding, form validation, and dependency injection. First introduced in 2013, React is a JavaScript library managed by Facebook, and it works for both single- and multi-page web applications. React is a framework for UI development that’s smaller and faster than Angular. However, it requires other libraries or modules to provide the full range of Angular’s functions. React is easy to install and use for anyone who already knows JavaScript, and because it operates with a virtual DOM, the browser load reduces. Angular operates with a real DOM, which leads to longer runtimes and slower performance.</p><p><strong>Is Angular free to use and where can I get it?</strong></p><p>Angular has both free and paid options, but the developer doesn’t provide pricing information about its paid version for enterprises and large organizations; this information is only available with a custom quote. Individual users can also obtain Angular for free from the developer site. This open-source software is available under an MIT license granted by Google, which gives permission to use the Angular application for any purpose without limitation. New users can also download a free trial version of Angular from the developer. This version is a ready-made standalone app that contains most key features of the platform, and you can install it on any computer without taking all the steps to create the full Angular environment. The free Angular app allows users to get started by learning Angular’s key features and creating a basic app of their own.</p><p><strong>What careers use Angular?</strong></p><p>Angular is one of the most popular web development platforms in use today. Skills in using Angular can be helpful for several careers in fields related to web design and development. Angular skills are most important for careers in practical web development, including specialties like frontend development, which involves designing client-facing web elements such as visual content, UI and UX development, and general software development. Software engineers and site designers can also benefit from learning Angular. It is a JavaScript application, so it’s also useful for JavaScript developers. It’s also possible to create a career around a specialization in Angular development alone. Angular development specialists can work as consultants or independent contractors with multiple organizations needing web development services.</p><p><strong>What IDE is best for Angular?</strong></p><p>An integrated development environment, or IDE, is a software application that consolidates essential web developer tools in a single graphical interface, which streamlines the development process and promotes consistency across all relevant platforms. Many IDEs now support Angular development projects, and there’s an option for every budget. The best paid IDE for Angular is Angular IDE. It was developed especially for the platform, so it supports all its features. Angular IDE is available as a standalone plugin or with an Eclipse plugin. New users can get a 45-day free trial before purchasing. Visual Studio Code is a general-purpose IDE that supports multiple development platforms, including Angular. This free, open-source IDE from Microsoft includes support for TypeScript code and several downloadable Angular plugins.</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React.JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong></p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching.</p><p>When you enroll, you will feel our seasoned instructors' expertise.</p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience.</p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now </p><p><strong> Full Stack Web Development with React JS, Angular and NodeJS.</strong></p><p>We offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Recently WordPress decided to change their old WYSIWYG editor into a new ReactJS based block editor known as 'Gutenberg'. Gutenberg <em>also known as the block editor </em>is based on blocks. So your post will be composed of some blocks and each block will have a purpose. You can have a block that displays a button or an image or some text and so on.&nbsp; </p><p>In this course you will learn everything you need to know in order to create custom blocks for the block editor. We will start by a simple block and then we will create some more complex blocks.</p><p>In order to gain the most out of this course you need to have WordPress theme/plugin development knowledge. Javascript knowledge is required for this course. You should be familiar with basic JavaScript concepts and preferably the recent ES6+ versions. ReactJS knowledge is also required for this course. So concepts like component state, hooks and basic react concepts should not be new to you. Also advanced concepts like higher order component knowledge would be ideal however it will be discussed briefly in the course. Redux knowledge is also ideal. Not all blocks will require using redux, however in some blocks we will use redux heavily. So it would be ideal if you are familiar with redux concepts like stores, actions, reducers and so on.</p><p>The course content will go as follows:</p><ul><li><p>First and before any coding we will discuss some design guidelines that you should follow when designing a block.</p></li><li><p>We will take a look on how your Gutenberg post is saved in your database and what happens behind the scenes in order to construct your ReactJS based UI from the content saved in the database.</p></li><li><p>In Section 2, we will create a WordPress plugin. Inside this plugin we will register out first Gutenberg block. We will also use a tool provided by WordPress called wp-scripts in order to process JS and CSS files in this plugin. We will also integrate tools like ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint and Husky for an improved development workflow.</p></li><li><p>In section 3, we will take a quick look on some stuff that you can do in your WordPress theme that will allow you to modify/add some features in the block editor.</p></li><li><p>In section 4 we will create a simple block. However in this simple block we will learn a lot about what we can do in a block.</p></li><li><p>In section 5 we will use our knowledge to create a more complex block with some advanced features. These features include how to add blocks inside of other blocks, how to handle images and many more.</p></li><li><p>Section 6 will be about creating dynamic blocks. So blocks can be static or in other words only generate some static HTML. But also they can be dynamic for example they can fetch something from the database.</p></li><li><p>Section 7 will discover more about the redux-like data stores in the block editor. We will see how to use the existing data stores and also create our own store.</p></li><li><p>Section 8 we will see different ways that we can follow in order to manage metadata in Gutenberg. We will manage metadata using a block. And we will also learn how to create a custom sidebar plugin and manage metadata in this sidebar.</p></li><li><p>In the final section we are going to discuss various topics like: context, patterns, templates, formatting API, filters and internationalization.</p></li></ul><p><br></p>",

By&nbsp; then we will be ready to learn complex data structures like arrays, objects, maps and sets.&nbsp; After that we will focus on some important JavaScript fundamentals&nbsp; such as closures, object creation, method chaining, prototype inheritances, call, apply, bind, spread operator, arrow function, promises.&nbsp; I will cover all of the latest features of JavaScript. Features such as <strong>Async Await</strong>, Array.from(), Array.Map() that were recently introduced. &nbsp;I&nbsp;will also go through ES2015, ES2016, ES2017, ES2018, ES2019, ES2010 and ES2021 features.&nbsp; You also will get lots of coding exercises to practice. In the end I will show you how to build few practical JavaScript Projects. You will surly enjoy building your own to-do list using pure JavaScript.&nbsp; One of the best feature of this course is its simplicity. All the coding samples are very easy to understand. I&nbsp;prefer to use <strong>real world use cases </strong> to explain concepts.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><br></p>",

Once we have learnt HTML &amp; CSS we will then build a full website from scratch called 'Imperial Donuts' which will include a navigation bar, image grids, a header and a footer. After that we will learn all the fundamental concepts in JavaScript such as the primitive data types, variables, control flow, loops, if statements, DOM manipulation etc. so that we learn how to achieve functionality in web applications. </p><p><br></p><p>We will also learn jQuery so that we can apply nice fade affects to webpages and create our own custom animations. After that we will move onto PHP which is a server-side language that powers 79% of websites today. Then, we will learn how to 'talk to' or query a database using mySQL. Once we have mastered all the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP &amp; mySQL we will then build a CRUD application where the user can create, read, update and delete data. </p><p><br></p><p>When you have finished 'The Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp' you will be a talented, confident, full-stack web developer and the great news is the course will be consistently updated with new content. </p><p>Darragh </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

Welcome to the complete Bootstrap course.</p><p>The course is project-based because we think that creating projects is the best way to learn one of the most popular and widely used technologies today - Bootstrap. Bootstrap allows us to build modern and nicely looking websites in a very simple way, so, if you want to take your web developer/designer skills to the next level, then you definitely need to know how to use bootstrap and what it actually does.</p><p>The course consists of several sections, we will start from Bootstrap basics like typography and utilities. Then you will be able to learn how to align elements on the page, using a Bootstrap grid system, and also, we will cover CSS Flexbox as well.</p><p>After that, comes the main and the most interesting parts of the course. We will start to build projects, in which you will be able to learn the rest of the topics of bootstrap, like bootstrap components and much more. Our first project will be built using pure Bootstrap without using any CSS or jQuery.</p><p>The second project will be the admin dashboard, in which we will use bootstraps and also some CSS and a little bit of jQuery. So, in this section, you will be able to learn how to create a modern and well-designed dashboard for admin.</p><p>The next project is going to be photoX. It will be a website about something like a photography company. This project will consist of multiple sections in which, you will meet more advanced and complicated things built with bootstrap, CSS, and jQuery.</p><p>As for the last project, it will be a kinda different and interesting one, we will build a website about something like book store and unlike previous projects, it will be more complicated and advanced. Throughout this project, we will build really nice and different types of sections, which will be impressive for you.</p><p>Each project will be fully responsive to all screen devices.</p><p>Throughout the course, you will meet detailed explanations about how bootstrap works, also, you will introduce to modern practices and solutions.</p><p><strong>Get fast and friendly support from instructors 24/7.</strong></p><p><strong>JOIN US!!!</strong></p>",

We will create <strong>Three real life projects</strong>,  so we can practice our react coding in a more <strong>real</strong> environment.</p><p>If you<strong> don’t know much of React</strong>, no worries. <strong>We will start simple</strong> with a static landing page , then we will go to a <strong>much more compete project</strong> with authentication and DB and last but not least we will create am e-commerce style project with user cart, PayPal, not only that we will create our own server to handle all the requests.</p><p>If you know nothing about React, don’t worry,<strong> I added a bonus section with a tiny React course </strong>so you can understand the basics and how react works. So you can start from there and <strong>then go to the practice projects.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>To<strong> sum everything up,</strong> this what we will be creating in this course:</p><p><br></p><p>Project one <em>”The venue”:</em></p><ul><li><p>How to create a project with React CLI</p></li><li><p>Creation of components</p></li><li><p>Using third party libraries</p></li><li><p>Creating transitions on reveal and carrousel.</p></li><li><p>Using parts of Material UI to make our app better.</p></li><li><p>Deployment of a static webpages to SURGE.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Project two<em> “M City”</em>:</p><ul><li><p>Creating of routes to navigate our project</p></li><li><p>More complex animations and transitions</p></li><li><p>Rendering components using data from a server</p></li><li><p>We will use authentication and create an Admin endpoint</p></li><li><p>Firebase uploads and storage</p></li><li><p>Add a database on a server to work with</p></li><li><p>Deployment of the project to Firebase</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Project three “<em>Waves</em>”:</p><ul><li><p>E-Commerce style application</p></li><li><p>Creation of dynamic routes</p></li><li><p>Using REDUX as store.</p></li><li><p>Authentication, user dashboard and admin dashboard</p></li><li><p>Create a server with Node JS and express</p></li><li><p>Add database to our Project with Mongo DB</p></li><li><p>Creating different routes to process the requests</p></li><li><p>Add cart items to user account</p></li><li><p>Complete checkout with Paypal</p></li><li><p>Deployment to Heroku</p></li></ul><p>And as a bonus just like tiny React course, you will get additional React components to the projects.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This is a course for Java professionals (or aspiring Java professionals) who need an in depth understanding of how web applications work in Java. In this course we cover how to build a website without using a framework. That might sound like a crazy thing to do but frameworks often hide the complexity of what's going on under the hood, so when things go wrong, we don't understand why, and therefore how to fix them. If you have never built a website with Java, or if you have only ever built sites using frameworks such as Spring Boot, JSF or Strus, this course will give you a really good grounding in the basics. And we'll also cover a number of topics that every good web developer should understand no matter what framework you use. </p>\n\n<p>You don't need to be a Java Expert to do this course, but you should be able to confidently create basic Java code before you start. Knowledge of simple HTML is also useful.</p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course I will be showing you how to create RESTful web services with PHP, <strong>no third party frameworks or paid software is needed.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We will be covering the basics of what REST is and how to implement the basics using <strong>pure vanilla PHP</strong>, at the end of this course you should be able to <strong>create a basic RESTful web service</strong> that you can allow other people to use.</p><p><br></p><p>The course will follow a scenario that we have been given and that is to implement a web service which can record a list of tasks, basically a to-do list. We will be implementing each requirement one at a time and then we will <strong>add on the ability for this API to become a multi user service</strong>. So each user can securely have their own task list. </p><p><br></p><p>To do this we will be implementing an authentication concept called <strong>Token based authentication</strong> and we will be exploring this further within the course, Token based authentication is a lot more secure than just basic password authentication and is now a best practice among the industry.</p><p><br></p><p>We will be starting at the beginning and building as we go, as long as you know the basics of PHP, such as variables, if statements, loops, arrays and some basic object orientated programming concepts you should be able to follow this course to the end. We will also be using MySQL for the database to store the tasks and we will be building and changing the database as we go, and again you don't need to be an expert on MySQL but just need to know the fundamentals such as basic select, update, delete SQL statements and concepts such as primary keys and foreign keys.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>BONUS SECTION&nbsp;ADDED -</strong> for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) which will allow you to adjust this API to run on a different domain/subdomain than your front end application.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>BONUS SECTION&nbsp;ADDED -</strong> for teaching you how to <strong>upload images/files against a task</strong>, we will go through the changes we need to make to the API to allow uploading of images to a task. We will then allow you to associate image attributes such as title and filename against the image as well as being able to download the image and delete the image.</p>",

  "description": "<p>A database is a crucial aspect of applications that are often only considered as an afterthought. However, for many developers deciding which database to use when building apps is a critical decision.</p>\n\n<p>Among the many popular data structures such as MySQL, MongoDB and Oracle, Redis is slowly gaining popularity within the NoSQL databases. Although, it already plays a supporting role for many companies including Twitter and Github, Redis is now gaining traction as a primary database.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So, what is Redis? Redis is an open-source data structure server that allows developers to organize data using a key-value storage method. This powerful database is perfect for high performance jobs such as caching. Redis is a no-fuss and fast database for many different functions including as a cache or a message broker.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This Redis tutorial is the best place for you to progress from a newbie to an advanced user of Redis. Go from knowing nothing about Redis, to actually being able to create an application using this powerful database.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This Redis course has been specifically designed for beginners who have never worked with Redis before. You will learn everything you need to know about Redis, including what is Redis, what is this database best used for, how to install Redis on your system, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will learn everything about the basic fundamentals of Redis such as the different data structures, various clients that work with Redis, different key-value pair commands (scan, config, commands, and client), how to persist data to disks and even the different methods of persisting data. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After you learn the basics, you will then build a functional working task manager along with the instructor that will teach how to actually work with Redis in a real-world example. You will build a task manager using NodeJS and Redis. You will also learn how to incorporate Twitter Bootstrap for designing the manager.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Start a newbie and end up mastering Redis in this amazing tutorial. Let’s get started and become an expert of this powerful database.</p>",

  "description": "<p>The Spring Framework is very popular with large companies. In fact, Spring is the most popular Java framework.</p><p>Did you know, a core reason for Spring's popularity with companies is it's IoC engine?</p><p>A typical company will deploy their Spring Framework application in at least 3 different environments. Having a development, test, and production environment is common.</p><p>The problem developers face is each environment is different.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Different server names.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Different databases.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Different user accounts.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Different passwords.</p></li></ul><p>In this course you will learn how to use Spring's IoC container to deploy your application in many different&nbsp;environments. Through Inversion of Control, your Spring application can wire itself for the needs of each environment.</p><p>You'll start the course learning advanced configuration options of the Spring Framework.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, the course takes a DevOps approach. You'll see how to deploy Spring Framework applications&nbsp;in different environments.</p><p>In development, it's common to use a H2 in memory database. Of course, this database is only temporary. Not something you'd want to use for your production deployment.</p><p>Do you want to see how to flip a switch and use MySQL? Flip another switch and your app can be using a RDS database managed Amazon. You can do this with no code changes.</p><p>The course also looks as best practices used in enterprise software development.&nbsp;</p><p>Using a continuous integration server is a best practice. Jenkins is the most popular CI server. You will learn how to install Jenkins on a Linux server. A server you provisioned in the AWS cloud.</p><p>Once you have Jenkins running on your AWS server a best practice is to setup Jenkins on a friendly URL.</p><p>Jenkins is a Java application running on port 8080. You don't want to be typing some IP colon 8080 into your browser to reach Jenkins.</p><p>Want to know how you can use Apache and Route 53 to reach your Jenkins server your own URL? To a domain you own?</p><p>Docker is an exciting technology. You will see how to leverage Docker to host your own Artifactory Maven repository. We'll use Artifactory to manage build artifacts produced by Jenkins.</p><p>Just for fun, we will also use Docker to setup a MySQL database server. We'll do this by provisioning a Linux server on AWS, installing Docker on it, and then deploy MySQL in a Docker container.</p><p>We'll also provision an application server we can use to run our Spring Boot application. You will pull the Spring Boot jar right from Artifactory and tell it to connect to database server.</p><p>Amazon AWS also has managed MySQL databases. This is their RDS service. You will see how to provision your own RDS database. We'll then reconfigure our Spring Boot application to connect to the RDS database.</p><p>There is a lot of fun and challenging content in this course. You will learn:</p><ul><li><p>How to manage Spring properties.</p></li><li><p>Why you want to encrypt sensitive properties, such as passwords.</p></li><li><p>How Spring Profiles are used.</p></li><li><p>Using YAML to configure Spring.</p></li><li><p>To provision servers on Amazon AWS.</p></li><li><p>Logging into your servers via SSH.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>How to use the yum package manager to install software on Linux.</p></li><li><p>How to configure your own Linux service.</p></li><li><p>How DNS works, and how to use Route 53 to setup your own host names.</p></li><li><p>How to use webhooks in GitHub to trigger your builds immediately.</p></li><li><p>Why you don't want to use root accounts for your application.</p></li><li><p>Configure Jenkins to perform a Maven build.</p></li><li><p>Use Jenkins to deploy build artifacts to Artifactory.</p></li></ul><p>This is a very hands on course. </p><p>To get the most out of this course, you will need an account on AWS. You should be able to use the AWS free tier to complete the course assignments.</p><p>To get the most out of this course, you will &nbsp;need a domain name. You will need to have control of the domain. Without this, you will not be able to configure subdomains in Route 53.</p><p>The course does leverage AWS for their cloud services. The skills you learn on the AWS platform will transfer to most corporate environments. AWS is used to mimic the typical company.</p><p>There is a lot of exciting content in this course!&nbsp;</p><p>DevOps is not an easy area. Many different technologies are involved.&nbsp;</p><p>In this course, you will see how easy it is to manage Spring Framework applications in complex corporate environments.</p>",

We will show you step-by-step how to configure a droplet with LAMP Stack on Ubuntu 18.04. This includes deploying a droplet, installing Ubuntu and all the components included in LAMP Stack including Apache, MySQL, PHP and PhpMyAdmin.</p><p>We also explore an exciting new feature offered by Digital Ocean, called \"Floating IP's\" which allow you to transfer IP's easily between multiple droplets.</p><p>After you understand the foundations of server configuration, we get into configuring Name Servers, DNS Zone Files and Virtual Hosts to host multiple domains from a single Virtual Server. You will have a thorough understanding of setting file permissions and developing an organized directory structure for all your websites. </p><p>We also show you how to configure an SSL certificate for each and every website that you host on your virtual server. For this part of the course we will be using Let’s Encrypt. Let’s Encrypt is a certificate authority that offers free SSL certificates, which are extremely simple to install and very secure. </p><p>You are welcome to use any hosting provider for this course, as the concepts can be easily implemented on any Virtual Server configured with the Ubuntu distribution.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong><em>Become the Expert!</em></strong></p><p>Are you a <strong>C#.NET</strong> developer&nbsp;ready to take the plunge into <strong>microservices</strong>?</p><p>Microsoft's ASP.NET <strong>Web API 2.0</strong> <strong>for .NET Framework</strong> is an outstanding, flexible platform for creating microservices.&nbsp; Unfortunately the official documentation is sparse, and you are left trying to piece together your understanding of this powerful platform by scouring the Internet for articles and examples that are often too&nbsp;academic, outdated, and not&nbsp;aligned with the practical needs of real-world services that must <strong>integrate </strong>with potentially many different kinds of clients and data center environments.</p><p>In this course, I will take you step by step through all of the layers of Web API to give you a full understanding of the platform components you will likely need to use in a modern, production-ready web service.&nbsp; Examples and exercises are drawn from <strong>practical, real-world scenarios</strong> of the sort&nbsp;I personally faced while creating commercial web services-- and chances are you will face them&nbsp;too!</p><p>We'll cover all of&nbsp;the core Web API features like&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>securing </strong>your API parameters,&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>extending </strong>the Web API to perform custom processing,&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>error handling</strong>,&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>authentication </strong>and <strong>authorization</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>We'll look at ways to <strong>test </strong>and <strong>document</strong> your service. We'll dig into performance improvements using techniques like&nbsp;<strong>caching </strong>and <strong>asynchronous </strong>operations. You'll get a clear understanding of how to make your service work correctly behind <strong>application proxies </strong>such as <strong>load balancers</strong> that every commercial web service uses in the real world.</p><p>I've put together everything you need in one place&nbsp;to create <strong>professional, production-ready Web API services</strong>. This course&nbsp;will save you&nbsp;many&nbsp;hours of time and give you&nbsp;a much deeper understanding of everything Web API has to offer than trying to learn a piece at a time through Google-- so get a jump-start now and <strong>become the Web API expert on your team!</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Experience</em></strong></p><p>The course experience is intended to feel like a more&nbsp;<strong>intimate, one-on-one setting</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want you to feel like you and I are both sitting down in front of your&nbsp;computer, reviewing some&nbsp;code in Visual Studio and&nbsp;having a friendly&nbsp;discussion about how things work, the pros and cons of a technique, and&nbsp;practical issues you might face when you start writing your own services using the framework.</p><p>The goal is not just to learn about the details of Web API.&nbsp; The examples and assignments are designed to create a web service mindset and give you of ways of thinking about the construction, performance and deployment of your web services, especially in scenarios that have unique cross-platform integration requirements.</p><p><strong><em>The Tech Stack</em></strong></p><p>This course specifically uses the standard <strong>.NET Framework</strong> version of Web API, which usually runs under <strong>IIS on Windows</strong> servers.&nbsp; If you are using .NET Core instead of .NET Framework, then while&nbsp;the concepts in this course are similar, the specific syntax for .NET Core Web API&nbsp;is very different.&nbsp; <strong>This probably isn't the course for you if you are specifically targeting .NET Core.</strong></p><p>For testing, we'll be using <strong>Fiddler</strong>, <strong>PostMan</strong> and <strong>Swagger</strong> (via the Swashbuckle library).</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Real World Focus</em></strong></p><p><strong>My \"Real World\" courses specifically target working developers solving actual problems in typical business programming scenarios.</strong>&nbsp; They are uniquely designed to cover areas you don't find in other courses on similar topics, from the specific viewpoint of developers who need to translate theory into practical application to solve the kinds of problems the \"overview\" courses don't help with.&nbsp; I assume you already know how to program and have built working commercial systems-- you won't find any \"Hello, world\" here!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Would you like to start learning AWS CloudFormation with well-organized courses?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Welcome to learn AWS CloudFormation step by step from a senior AWS architect with hands-on examples and detailed explanations! I designed AWS&nbsp;CloudFormation topics into two courses to teach you efficiently according to your knowledge level. Now, you are on the first step!</p><p><br></p><p>This course is for beginners to AWS&nbsp;CloudFormation. You will learn most of the <strong>Associate-level </strong>topics, excel at the basics, and learn some intermediate-level features like change sets. Ultimately, you will start using Cloud&nbsp;Formation for your daily needs on&nbsp;AWS.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This course also serves as a basis for my <strong>AWS&nbsp;CloudFormation Step by Step: Intermediate to Advanced</strong> course, which teaches more advanced, Professional-level AWS CloudFormation concepts. Thus, you can continue your Cloud Formation journey with it afterward.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why learn from me?</strong></p><p>✓ AWS verified my knowledge and experience at the top level. I am a senior AWS consultant holding <strong>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional </strong>and <strong>AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional </strong>certifications in addition to <strong>all 3 Associate certificates</strong>.</p><p>✓ I have a software engineering background, a BS degree in Computer Engineering, and <strong>more than 15 years of professional experience </strong>as a developer and cloud architect in corporates and startups.</p><p>✓ I have been <strong>using AWS since 2013.</strong> I have also been using AWS CloudFormation since the early days. So you will benefit from my experience as well as my knowledge.</p><p>✓ I learned by doing. I teach <strong>both theory and practice</strong> according to the AWS best practices. I explain the features with hands-on examples and why to use them with advantages and disadvantages. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is the course structure?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 1: </strong>Understand what AWS&nbsp;CloudFormation is and learn to create and delete stacks from existing templates.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Section 2:</strong> Start writing your own templates with YAML and define resources in them. You will also learn to update your stacks by editing your templates.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Section 3: </strong>Increase the reusability of your templates with parameters. You will make many examples with different parameter types, constraints, etc.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Section 4: </strong>Define the Metadata and Mappings sections in your templates to enhance them more.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Section 5: </strong>Create resources and configure their attributes conditionally using the Conditions section. You will also learn how to define outputs for your stacks.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Section 6: </strong>Create and execute AWS CloudFormation change sets to update your stacks safely.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Section 7:</strong> Learn to manage your stacks and change sets using the cloudformation commands of AWS CLI as an alternative to AWS&nbsp;CloudFormation Console.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Section 8:</strong> Conclusion. Now you are ready to learn advanced-level CloudFormation with <strong>AWS&nbsp;CloudFormation Step by Step: Intermediate to&nbsp;Advanced.</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>As a result,</strong></p><p><strong>✓</strong> You will be able to use AWS CloudFormation daily.</p><p><strong>✓ </strong>You will be able to write your Cloud Formation templates using YAML.</p><p><strong>✓ </strong>We will use the AWS Ireland region (eu-west-1) during the course. But you will also learn to create re-usable, region-independent CloudFormation templates as you progress!</p><p><strong>✓ </strong>You will gain a solid basis on AWS CloudFormation and be ready to learn more advanced features with my AWS&nbsp;CloudFormation&nbsp;Step by&nbsp;Step: Intermediate to&nbsp;Advanced course. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, is this course for you?</strong></p><ul><li><p>As a beginner, it will be best to concentrate on the Cloud Formation features that you will need most at the beginning.<strong> I designed this course for beginners to AWS CloudFormation. </strong>So, I assume that you have no or little experience in it.<br></p></li><li><p>You need to have<strong> intermediate-level AWS knowledge </strong>that will be enough to use core AWS services in our examples<strong>.</strong> This course focuses on AWS CloudFormation.<br></p></li><li><p>This is<strong> </strong>NOT for<strong> </strong>intermediate-level AWS CloudFormation users looking for more advanced features<strong>. </strong>I teach them in my<strong> AWS&nbsp;CloudFormation&nbsp;Step by&nbsp;Step: Intermediate to&nbsp;Advanced </strong>course, which continues from this one. </p><p><br></p></li><li><p>Are you unsure of your Cloud Formation knowledge level? Then, start with this Beginner to Intermediate course and continue with the advanced course.<br></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>If you want to start using AWS CloudFormation to manage your AWS infrastructure as code and automate the provisioning of your AWS resources, then you are in the right place.</p><p><strong>Join me in this course to start learning AWS CloudFormation step by step!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>Emre Yilmaz</p><p>Senior AWS Architect &amp; DevOps Engineer</p><p>⭑ <em>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional</em></p><p>⭑ <em>AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional</em></p><p>⭒ <em>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate</em></p><p>⭒ <em>AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate</em></p><p>⭒ <em>AWS Certified Developer - Associate</em></p>",

I was shocked. his teaching style is like a real. I highly recommend to the new user who wants to learn all the combination such as react node and angular. also, one more thing he tries to give the response out of this framework such as if you get stuck in javascript, react native and so on. you won't be regret after purchasing his course. I guaranteed 100%.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>I took this course because the MERN stack project presented in the previews looked much more in depth and had way more features compared to other courses and projects I have seen before. This course has not disappointed so far. His use of the Google Maps API, HOC's, Authentication, etc for the course project are some of the coolest features and best code I have seen written for MERN in a while. My constructive feedback for this course is that the way the Instructor explains the basics of React, Redux, HOC's in the beginning are too fast paced and do not provide enough detail. This was not an issue for me as I am well versed in React already, and simply wanted to IMPROVE my React skills rather than relearn the basics. The instructor is passionate, responds quickly to questions, and is continually adding new features such as Image Uploads for the project which I am super excited for. I will definitely be keeping an eye out for future content by this instructor. TLDR: This course is great for increasing your React Skills and creating an Awesome MERN Project. However, if you are trying to learn the basics of React, I would suggest other courses.\n</em></p><p><em>Very good and interesting course, I as a beginner I did not have any problem to start programming without problems! a man jumps into it, and it is a fascinating and seductive beautifully illustrated. I'm still in the middle yet, but I can not wait for another lesson! For me nicely done! keep up with good work :)</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Get all you need to start web development in one course.</strong></p><p>You will pay once and you will get a lifetime access to this up-to-date course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You have nothing to loose, you can only gain.</strong></p><p>Do not forget that you are protected by 1 month money-back guarantee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>100% Answer Rate! </strong>Every single question posted to this class is answered within 24 hours <em>by the instructor.</em></p><p><strong>You can earn a living, or make some cash on the side, as a freelancer or full-time WooCommerce theme developer</strong></p><p>Are you looking for a comprehensive WooCommerce theme development course? Have you ever thought about becoming a professional WooCommerce theme developer and make some money on the side?</p><p>Today WooCommerce is quickly becoming the next big thing in e-commerce. Its mission is to transform any WordPress website into a real e-commerce store. And it really does! That's why so many developers today want to learn how to create themes for it. </p><p>You'll find many WooCommerce tutorials out there, but most of the times they are very confusing.</p><p>This course is different. It features almost 100 lessons in which I'll really share with you everything I've learned so far about creating themes, especially about how to build a WordPress theme with WooCommerce compatibility.</p><p>Today, many developers make money quickly building themes to people who want a custom theme for their stores. Good freelancers will charge anywhere between <strong>$3,000</strong> and <strong>$15,000</strong> for a simple custom WordPress website. WordPress sites with WooCommerce capabilities are more profitable to clients, so they are <strong>more than willing to pay even more</strong>! </p><p>Many other developers earn a living selling premium versions of their themes. And you can be one of them too! </p><p>I'm an instructor of more than 25,000 satisfied students only here at Udemy and I know how to help you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What exactly are you going to learn?</strong></p><p>Here's a quick list of the main subjects covered by this course. You'll learn:</p><ul><li><p>How to create a classic WordPress theme that works perfectly well with Woocommerce (NOTE: in this course, a classic theme will be created, not a block theme);</p></li><li><p>How to declare WooCommerce support and customize your themes. Your clients' online stores will become even more attractive;</p></li><li><p>How to modify the WooCommerce template files in the right way. Your store will look the way you want;</p></li><li><p>How to use the WooCommerce shortcodes the way no one does;</p></li><li><p>How to use powerful tools like Theme Customizer and TGM Plugin Activation to make the store shine;</p></li><li><p>How to create a responsive menu and a sexy and modern slideshow&nbsp; - without using plugins!</p></li><li><p>How to add a blog to the e-commerce store. Your theme users will sell more!</p></li></ul><p><strong>And more! How about learning how to create demo versions of your theme? </strong></p><p>If your intention is to sell premium versions of your theme, you'll see that the ones with demo versions are the top sellers. Your clients will love them! </p><p><strong>And how about making them available in any language? </strong></p><p>You'll learn how to create themes that are fully translatable. Clients from all over the world will be able to use your themes, as they will be fully compatible with Poedit or any WordPress translation plugin. </p><p>And it doesn't end here... </p><p><strong>How about making your WooCommerce themes really secure?</strong></p><p>You will learn how to put in place, step by step, the main WordPress security features in your theme's code! Just relax! There will be no loopholes for anyone to attack your theme.</p><p><strong>And to top it off, start a new career as an official WordPress/WooCommerce theme developer</strong></p><p>Follow me as I send the theme created in the course out to the official WordPress theme repository. This is one of the best strategies for those who want to start making money by creating themes, even free ones. </p><p>You will understand all the tests that are necessary to pass through the strict review system of WordPress, until the publication of the theme. And, of course, you'll also understand some of the strategies you can use to make money with the theme and make a living as a theme creator. Yes, you can make money, even with free themes hosted at the official WordPress theme repository.</p><p>And, on top of that, all the content is loaded with basic notions about creating WordPress themes such as loops, inner pages, sidebars, template parts, filters, action hooks, page templates, enqueuing Bootstrap and Google fonts etc. Really, I won't hide anything in this course!</p><p>Besides, you'll have all the material available to follow the lessons.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who this course is for?</strong></p><p>I recommend this course to programmers, IT students, web developers, web designers, or any freelancer or full-time professional who works with PHP, HTML and CSS. It's recommended for everyone who want to build a full-time business, creating custom WooCommerce themes for clients or for selling.</p><p><em>I don't recommend, in any way, for curious people, shop owners, or people who don't know how to write code yet. </em></p><p>This is not a regular WooCommerce course. My goal is to teach the student how to create a theme, so we'll be writing a lot of code. If you are interested in just creating a webstore, without having to understand programming, there are several other courses that can help you out there. </p><p>This course is not about setting up a store. We are not going to learn how to configure payment methods, product shipping methods. We are not going to test those extraordinary membership plugins. We are not going to configure subscription plugins, marketing plugins, nothing like that. </p><p>This course is aimed at all those who want to become professional theme creators. Basically the course is aimed at two types of people.</p><ol><li><p>Those who would like to become independent, create their own custom theme, learning to customize the look of the store the way they want, or learn to customize third-party themes. They can do it for themselves, or for their clients.</p></li><li><p>People who have plans to fly even higher! If you are already a little tired of working with annoying deadlines, boring clients, endless projects, anyway, if you want to start building a career with more freedom, more time for you, doing what you like to do, you will love the content that I have prepared for you!</p></li></ol><p>In this course I will guide you, step by step, in the beginning of your professional career as a WooCommerce theme developer. I'll show you, from start to finish, how to create a theme following all the recommendations of the WordPress theme review team. </p><p>In the bonus section of the course you'll learn everything you need in order to make a theme pass the hard tests of the WordPress theme repository, how to bundle WooCommerce with the theme, how to prepare a theme demo, how to make your theme go international, how to make it totally secure, and much more.</p><p>In the end, I'll show you how to submit this theme to the WordPress theme repository, which is a wonderful showcase from which you can attract buyers to a premium version of the theme.</p><p>The course is also a basis for you to send the theme to other platforms, such as ThemeForest, which is one of the largest premium theme marketplaces in the world. Knowing how to do this for the official repository, you're on your way to go anywhere!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How is this course <em>different</em>?</strong></p><p>What my students like the most is the excellent response time to their questions. You know, long waiting times can slow down your progress. So, I always try to reply within 24 hours. You can be sure you’ll never feel alone in this course.</p><p>Here's what my student Ryan Johnson has to say about one of my courses: </p><p><em>“I'm almost done with my own theme, ran in to an issue, and Marcelo has responded back with very detailed, quick help. I don't know how he does it! (…) Marcelo has laid this course out well, when you come up to a snag do everything you can to research and fix it on your own, but if you can't he's there for you. That's huge for me and may be for you, too.”</em></p><p>Or my student Adnan Usman…</p><p><em>\"Marcelo has been amazing at explaining everything and has been extremely responsive when I ask questions while doing the course. I am not 100% done with the course yet but due to his diligence and quick and thorough responses I could not wait to give him a 5 star rating.” </em></p><p>And Christopher Moldrickx…</p><p><em>“Marcelo is very knowledgeable and makes the course enjoyable. He answered my questions in the forum fully and within a few hours time. Frankly, I would buy any WP course from Marcelo!” </em></p><p>And the list goes on…</p><p>So, are you ready for this course? You can always watch the free available lectures before you make your decision. Remember, this is a Udemy course, so you’ve nothing to lose. You can count on our 100% 30-day money-back guarantee in case you don’t like it. No questions asked.</p><p>So join me right now. From now on, the sky is your limit!</p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course we're going to look at<strong> GLSL ( OpenGL Shading Language)</strong> to create <strong>amazing effects</strong>. </p><p>Maybe you are</p><ul><li><p> a designer who has seen some terrific, <strong>cutting edge</strong> websites using <strong>cool transitions</strong> and wondered how it was done. You may have heard about WebGL and know that you can use some simple <strong>THREE.js</strong> code to do some <strong>remarkable things</strong>. </p></li><li><p>a developer trying to <strong>visualise some data</strong> in a striking way. </p></li><li><p>a game developer wanting to add some <strong>custom effects</strong> to your 3d objects surfaces.</p></li></ul><p><strong>GLSL</strong> is how you can use <strong>OpenGL</strong> to display a surface. The code syntax is based on the C language, but fear not, we will assume you have literally no knowledge of this language at all and we will, as the course title states, learn this from scratch. GLSL uses the <strong>GPU</strong> ( the Graphics Processing Unit) to handle multiple programs at the same time, so <strong>it is unbelievably fast</strong>. </p><p>In the course we will be writing code for the browser, because this allows us to focus on GLSL, without needing to worry about installing any additional software. We will be using the <strong>THREE.js WebGL library</strong> and <strong>CodePen</strong> so you can instantly edit the source and see the results, needing nothing other than a browser to experiment. Only a small amount of Javascript is used but this will be explained thoroughly as it comes along. But you can also use what you learn about GLSL in a <strong>C/C++/C#</strong> program&nbsp;or a <strong>Python</strong> program.</p><p>We will start from really simple examples and progress slowly through each stage of developing a custom shader. You will be able to play with the shader code on CodePen, so you can <strong>experiment with different values </strong>to see the impact it has on the end result. </p><p>GLSL shaders are split into <strong>vertex shaders</strong> and <strong>fragment shaders</strong> and we will focus initially on the fragment shader, working essentially in a 2d environment. With <strong>dozens of shaders in the course resources</strong> you will learn the language in <strong>gentle stages</strong>. </p><p>Creating your own shaders means<strong> understanding</strong> the GLSL language and that is the <strong>aim of the course</strong>. You could search for a suitable shader on ShaderToy, ShaderFrog or glslViewer and then try to adapt the code. But without knowing the language you're going to find that difficult to do. To <strong>really be effective</strong> you need to know about the GLSL language, shaping functions, tiling, polar coordinates and lighting calculations. To do this you will need to follow along with the course and complete the <strong>many challenges</strong> suggested. At the end you will then be able to create any shader that you can imagine. </p><p>As usual there is a <strong>30 day money back guarantee</strong>. So you have nothing to lose. <strong>Let's get shading today</strong>! </p><p><br></p><p>What students say</p><p>\"I came here interested in making a <strong>custom lighting shader</strong> on an obj model, and <strong>I really found answers</strong> to my questions and more. The two faced aspect of the lessons and the CodePen sketches [are] great. <strong>I thank you</strong> !\"</p><p>\"<strong>A great course</strong>! Methodical, <strong>step by step</strong> explanations not only of the GLSL but also of the general theory behind shaders, <strong>usable with any shader system</strong>. <strong>Essential</strong> if you are into computer graphics or generative art. Thank you!\"</p><p>\"I've tried to pick up shaders in the past but found it quite difficult. Unlike other resources I've found, this course was the course that finally <strong>helped me get a much better grasp of glsl</strong>. It is <strong>well structured</strong> and very informative. I would <strong>recommend</strong> it to anyone looking to pick up glsl.\"</p><p>\"This is <strong>exactly what I needed</strong>. I am a web designer/developer with design background and a good a good deal of javascript experience I'm trying to get into 3D visualizations for web. Since GLSL is written in C language it had been a huge barrier. I <strong>totally recommend</strong> this course to anyone having problems to get a <strong>clear understanding of GLSL.</strong>\"</p><p>\"So far this course has been <strong>really amazing</strong>. Very few courses on shaders really take the time to <strong>explain the math</strong> behind what's happening in a way that <strong>let's \"non-math\" folk develop an intuition for it</strong>. Great job!\"</p><p>\"I was always intimidated by the idea of GLSL, even though I'm an advanced front-end developer. I've always been terrible at math; and yet <strong>Nik's style of teaching made me understand everything very intuitively</strong> and I'm so comfortable with shaders now. I've bought 60+ courses on Udemy; and I quit most of them after a couple videos. This one has me <strong>hooked on my chair</strong> until I finish everything! <strong>Coding along to this course is fun</strong> and Nik's challenges feel very rewarding to either solve or understand through his <strong>crystal clear explanation</strong>!\"</p><p>\"This is a <strong>perfect course</strong> for anyone wanting to learn about GLSL in a <strong>gradual manner</strong>. The instructor makes sure to spend enough time in the basic functions of GLSL, so students can <strong>get a proper understanding</strong> before moving on to the next concept. I had found GLSL a bit daunting in the past because examples would get out of hand very quickly, so <strong>I really appreciate this course's approach.</strong>\"</p><p>\"Another <strong>master piece</strong> of Mr. Lever. He is an <strong>incredible instructor</strong> and deep understanding of the math behind computer graphics. A must watch even if you are already an experienced CG programmer.\"</p><p>\"Everything was <strong>explained very well</strong> &amp; in a understandable manners. Minor details of Math I was not aware of, I learned in this course. Thank you Nicholas Lever!\"</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE THIS COURSE TEACHES ANGULAR 1. IF YOU WANT TO LEARN THE LATEST VERSION </strong><strong>ANGULAR 2YOU CAN CHECK OUR COURSE </strong><strong>\"Learn Angular 2 Development By Building 12 Apps\"  </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>THIS COURSE IS GOOD FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDS TO MAINTAIN ANGULAR 1 CODE.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most comprehensive AngularJS training program is here. We love this amazingly powerful framework for web apps and we promise you will love this course. By the end of it you will understand the concepts behind Angular design and will be able to create you own websites and apps. AngularJS was initially released in 2009 and it has been growing rapidly ever since. If you want to be a web developer you must learn AngularJS and with time it is going to be as essential as HTML. Our Angular course will focus on important features such as decoupling DOM manipulation and to decouple client side from the server side implementation in web apps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So why use AngularJS?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>• AngularJS uses directives to add new mark-ups to HTML and turns static HTML files in to something dynamic. It is an innovative approach to incorporating HTML and developing big web applications.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>• AngularJS organizes views, controllers, directives, filters and such other elements in to separate modules. This division becomes convenient for building and managing an application.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>• AngularJS has a built-in dependency injection system and is unit-testable.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>• AngularJS uses data-binding directives to provide a projection of the model to the application view. It automates synchronization of data between model and view components. This allows developers to avoid writing a considerable amount of boilerplate code.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>• AngularJS has a built-in template engine consisting of plain HTML pages (views) as well as controllers written in JavaScript to build rich user interfaces.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>• AngularJS uses directives to extend HTML dialect by creating new HTML elements and attributes as well as custom HTML tags that work as new widgets.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Projects Developed for the Course includes:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Basic Angular Website</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Learn to create Angular Websites and concepts such as two way binding, url routing and directives</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Web Template Store </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Learn creation of store based Apps with the project. Implement payment using paypal</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>myContactsApp</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>A complete CRUD application in Angular JS. Learn the use of Firebase API</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ngSocialApp</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Learn to use facebook APIs with Angular JS. The App uses facebook's graph API to authenticate the users </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Job Directory</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>A complete MEAN stack project where user can post search and apply for jobs. There will also be login subscription feature.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Knowledgebase</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Learn to build an Article repository with nodejs, MongoDB and Angular JS. It will teach you major aspects of both front end and backend programming using JS technologies.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>User Authentication App</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Learn to build a hybrid app. Learn the use of Sails framework for backend node server. learn professional web development techniques.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Intagram Gallery</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Build a full fledged photo gallery application. Learn to integrate Instagram APIs</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PubNub Chat</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Build a real time chat application. Learn the use of PubNub data streaming API with Angular JS</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>All the above web apps have been selected to provide our students a complete walk through of Angular development environment. You can also use the source code for each project to build your own commercial apps completely royalty free. So join us now and start building the next awesome web app using AngularJS.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>May 2021 Course Update!&nbsp;Added a new section of live coding workshops, including a deep dive on how to work with React hooks</strong></p><p>Are you ready to build professional applications that combine the front end frameworks, such as <strong>React JS</strong> and <strong>Angular</strong> with Ruby on Rails as a backend? Then this is the course for you. My name is Jordan Hudgens, and I'll be your instructor for the course. In addition to being the lead instructor for devCamp I've also been building web applications for over a decade for organizations such as Eventbrite and Quip.</p><p>After you have completed this course you will be able to build modern React JS, Angular, and Ruby on Rails 5 applications. In fact, in this course we're going to develop several applications that highlight the powerful and dynamic features offered by front end frameworks such as React JS and Angular working as the user interfaces, and Ruby on Rails API apps functioning as the backend. This is a powerful combination since you will learn how to create incredibly fast, dynamic React JS&nbsp;and Angular applications that embrace features such as real time updates, along with the power and flexibility provided by the Ruby on Rails framework.</p><p>Throughout the course material you will learn concepts such as:</p><ul><li><p>How to configure your system to run Angular and React JS Applications</p></li><li><p>How to generate an Angular applications</p></li><li><p>How to generate React JS&nbsp;applications</p></li><li><p>What it takes to build React and Angular components</p></li><li><p>How to work with Angular Observables to automatically update page elements without even needing to refresh the page.</p></li><li><p>Along with how to communicate with APIs and parse the data they return.</p></li><li><p>How to integrate authentication from scratch with session based auth</p></li><li><p>And everything else you'll need in order to build real world React JS and Angular applications, with a Ruby on Rails API!</p></li></ul><p>This is not an entry level course. You will need at least a basic understanding of Rails in order to go through this material. Additionally, I also recommend that you are familiar with the TypeScript and JavaScript programming languages, however if you haven't worked with TypeScript or JavaScript before, you can still work through the course.</p><p>Each lesson of the course is paired with the source code that I used in the guide so you can check your work. And since the application we're building is a real world app I'll constantly be adding to the course material with new features, as I do with my other courses.</p><p>Please feel free to review the course curriculum and I look forward to going through the material with you on your development journey!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>The Complete Web Development Masterclass: Beginner To Advanced </strong></p><p>The most comprehensive yet precise course on web development to build web development skills.</p><p>If you aspire to become a professional <strong>web developer</strong> or if you want to get into the field of <strong>web development</strong> then this is the right course to start with.</p><p>This course is specially designed to build a skillset around all the modern web development technologies which are in-demand by <strong>tech companies</strong> in 2018.</p><p>Upon course completion, you will be able to build full-stack, mobile responsive, database oriented web applications. </p><p><strong>Here Is What You Get By Enrolling In This Course:</strong></p><p><strong>Word-By-Word Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;In the entire course, I explain each line of code, without skipping a single line of code.</p><p><strong>Awesome Quality Content:</strong>&nbsp;18 hours of HD Videos.</p><p><strong>Well Structured &amp; Easy To Learn:&nbsp;</strong>Course has been specially designed to make it easy for the students to learn HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap4, JavaScript,ES6 Git &amp; Github, VueJs, NodeJs, PostgreSQL.</p><p><strong>24 X 7 Support:</strong>&nbsp;I will always be there to guide you in your journey to become Python expert.</p><p><strong>Note: Student queries and problems will be answered immediately.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here Is Everything You Will Learn&nbsp;In This Complete&nbsp;Course:</strong></p><p><strong>The Complete Course is divided into 12&nbsp;Major sections</strong></p><p><strong>Section 1:</strong>&nbsp;HTML5.</p><p><strong>Section 2:</strong>&nbsp;CSS.</p><p><strong>Section 3:</strong>&nbsp;Building A Portfolio Site.</p><p><strong>Section 4</strong>: Bootstrap 4.</p><p><strong>Section 5:</strong>&nbsp;Building A News Portal.</p><p><strong>Section 6:</strong>&nbsp;JavaScript.</p><p><strong>Section 7:</strong> ES6.</p><p><strong>Section 8:</strong> Git &amp; Github.</p><p><strong>Section 9:</strong> VueJs.</p><p><strong>Section 10: </strong>NodeJs.</p><p><strong>Section 11:</strong> PostgreSQL.</p><p><strong>Section 12:</strong> Final Project:Medical Inventory Management Web App.</p><p>First we start off by learning the basics of <strong>Web Development</strong> and installing the required tools to write HTML5 code. In this section we cover almost all the <strong>HTML5</strong> concepts and learn how to layout the <strong>structure of HTML elements</strong> on the webpage.</p><p>In the next section we learn the basics of CSS which will help us make our site look appealing. We will learn how we can add CSS to your existing HTML pages to make them more visually attractive. We will also learn about <strong>CSS flex box</strong> which will help us to make responsive layouts.</p><p>Now as we know HTML &amp; CSS, its now time to build something from the skills we have acquired. In this section we will build a <strong>portfolio site </strong>with HTML &amp; CSS which will list all your skills. </p><p>Moving along we now start learning <strong>Bootstrap 4</strong>, a CSS framework which enables us to build <strong>fully mobile responsive websites</strong> in no time. Bootstrap 4 will make your development speed <strong>2X</strong> as faster as you no longer have to build components from scratch. Bootstrap has hundreds of built in components which we can use to build websites quickly and without any hassle. We will learn about the<strong> Bootstrap grid system</strong> and learn how to make responsive layouts with it. </p><p>Once we master Bootstrap 4, its now time to build a <strong>fully mobile responsive news portal</strong>. In this section we will build a news portal which will work and look great on all of the devices like a computer, tablet and a smartphone. The best part about this news portal is that its completely built using Bootstrap and its components. Meaning we have not used a single line of CSS code to style the elements.</p><p>The next section is all about <strong>JavaScript</strong> which is the most popular language for front end web development. We will start off by learning the basics of how JavaScript can be used in the browser to make websites more interactive. We will learn data types, functions, global and local scope, loops, exceptions and all of the other basics related to javaScript. At the end of this section, we also build a <strong>simple interest calculator </strong>using JavaScript and Bootstrap. </p><p>Then we learn about ES6 or <strong>ECMAScript6</strong> which is the latest version of JavaScript. We will learn some of the most relevant and new features of ES6 like the let and the const keywords.</p><p> We then move towards learning <strong>Git &amp; Github</strong> which is one of the most popular tools amongst web developers across the globe. We will start by learning what is Git and how Git can be used for <strong>version control</strong>. We will learn about all the important commands required to work with Git all with a practical example. Later we start learning GitHub and learn how GitHub can be used to <strong>collaborate with teams</strong> while working on a project. </p><p>In the next section we learn about <strong>VueJS</strong> which is a progressive front end framework which helps us to build <strong>user interface components</strong> in an efficient way. VueJs is now being used by a lot of tech companies and is much easier to learn as compared to other similar frameworks like React. Many developers prefer VueJs over React because of its learning curve and the <strong>extensive documentation</strong> available online. In this section we will cover all the important aspects of VueJs.</p><p>Once we finish learning the front end technologies, its now time to start learning about the <strong>backend</strong>. </p><p>We now start learning about <strong>NodeJS</strong> which is a<strong> JavaScript runtime</strong> which allows us to run JavaScript on the server. NodeJS is extremely powerful and it allows us to <strong>configure server</strong>, connect to database, make queries and a lot more can be done using Node. In this section we will start learning Node right from the basics and we will build our very own server. We will also learn about the <strong>node package manager</strong> and learn how it can be used to install and use different node packages which are used to extend the functionality of our apps.</p><p>&nbsp;Now once we know how about Node, we now need a <strong>database</strong> to be able to store and manage our data at the backend. Hence we move on to learn about <strong>Postgres</strong> which is a database used and trusted by large software companies. We will learn about <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> which is a structured query language used to query the Postgres database. We will learn how to create our very own database from scratch and how to setup the structure to store and manage our data.</p><p>In the final section we apply everything we have learned in the entire course by building a fully functional <strong>medical inventory web application.&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p><p>This will be a complex <strong>database oriented</strong> application which will store data into the Postgres database and allow us to insert, update, delete and modify medicine records from the front end. We will learn how to build a complete web app from scratch right from building the database, configuring our server to building the front end. <br></p><p><br></p><p>So let's begin the journey of becoming an&nbsp;<strong>expert Web Developer.</strong></p><p>In addition to the&nbsp;<strong>Udemy</strong>&nbsp;<strong>30-day money back guarantee</strong>,you have my personal guarantee that you will love what you learn in this course. If you ever have any questions please feel free to message me directly and I will do my best to get back to you as soon as possible!</p><p><br></p><p>Make sure to enrol in the course before the price changes.</p><p>Take yourself one step closer towards becoming a professional web developer&nbsp;<strong>by clicking the \"take this course button\" now!</strong></p><p>Join the journey.</p><p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p><p><strong>Ashutosh Pawar</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Update April 2021: </strong>Added a guide showing how to create a custom cursor in HTML/CSS. Also added a one hour live coding workshop that teaches how to build out tooltips on a website.</p><p>Hi and welcome to the <strong>HTML/CSS Bootcamp course</strong>, where we'll walk through the same course I teach code bootcamp students around the world. My name is Jordan Hudgens, and I'll be your instructor for the course. In addition to being the lead instructor for devCamp I've also been building web applications for over a decade for organizations such as Eventbrite and Quip.</p><p>In this course, you're going to learn all of the key skills that you're going to need in order to start building out professional websites. Before building this new course out, I&nbsp;interviewed hiring managers at companies around the world and asked them what HTML/CSS skills they expected developers to know and that's how I&nbsp;came up with the list of concepts that you're going to learn.</p><p>Some of the skills that you're going to learn are going to be:</p><ul><li><p>HTML5</p></li><li><p>CSS3</p></li><li><p>Flexbox</p></li><li><p>CSS Grid</p></li><li><p>Animations</p></li><li><p>Media queries for building responsive layouts from scratch</p></li><li><p>CSS&nbsp;Selectors</p></li><li><p>Navigation</p></li><li><p>Fonts</p></li><li><p>Forms</p></li><li><p>How to integrate and style images</p></li><li><p>Front end development best practices</p></li><li><p>And much more!</p></li></ul><p>As we go through the course material, you'll notice that I'm going to teach you my own process that I use whenever I'm building out a website.</p><p>My goal for this entire course isn't just to teach you how to build a single website, but instead my goal is to be able to leverage this project build that we're going to put together, teach you the fundamentals as we implement every single feature, and then by the end of it, you're not just going to be able to build the single website and follow along with what I do, but you'll be able to build any type of website.</p><p>There are no technical prerequisites for going through this course. This is the perfect course to go through if you want to learn how to build websites completely from scratch.</p><p>The ideal student is someone who is dedicated, wants to learn, and also wants to learn how to build websites using the most modern and up to date technologies. So, thank you for spending the time and going through this material, and good luck with the coding.</p>",

Right off the bat, it's as if the rabbit will win. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>But the rabbit gets caught up, spins its wheels and veers off course. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The turtle moves forward, nice and steady, consistently towards the finish line. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that the turtle wins. The rabbit was way too confident and didn't pay attention to the race, thinking there was plenty of time to win. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The moral of the story? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don't be like the rabbit.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>SEO is hard enough as it is when you try to learn it on your own. But don't try to blaze through material that you find anywhere on the web. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Why? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you end up doing the wrong things, you could suffer the wrath of Google. And those penalties are hard to recover from.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you're frustrated and feeling like the rabbit, that's okay. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Even if success in the field of SEO has long alluded you, and even if the thought of trying to consume all of the content that makes for a successful SEO campaign is all-consuming, there's hope for you yet. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The truth? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>SEO is an increasingly-complex field. And it keeps expanding its virtual tentacles. There's a lot of information to grasp and rules to digest before you can actually succeed. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And that's precisely what I'm going to teach you. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Allow me to teach you how to SEO the right way... like a real pro. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This information is quite literally worth its weight in gold. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, students pay me hundreds of times the amount of this course for one-on-one instruction.

  "description": "<p>This course will show you--from start to finish--how to build a real-life application with AngularJS. Angular is awesome, but it can be tricky to learn, especially if you are newer to web development. This is especially true if you're trying to figure out how to build an actual working application in it. It can seem like a daunting task--especially since many tutorials out there don't show how to do it from scratch.</p><p>The good news is that it's not that hard once you know how all the pieces work together. This course will teach you those pieces and how they fit together so that you can build your own real life single page web applications that persist data to a database.</p><p>This course is for all levels, but you will find it especially useful if you are newer to web development. You should know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but by no means do you need to be an expert. We'll be using tools like the command line and NodeJS to install packages, but we'll be seeing how to use them from scratch, so you don't need to have prior knowledge of them.</p><p>This course brings together many commonly requested AngularJS subjects that aren't seen in a lot of other ones, including:</p><ul><li>Directives</li><li>Routing</li><li>Angular Material</li><li>Angular 2</li></ul><p>If you want to learn how to build a single page app with AngularJS, and want to learn it from scratch, then this is the best course you'll find.

  "description": "<p><strong>Modern. Focused. Production-minded.</strong></p><p>This course is a clear, hands-on path to mastering <strong>React Hooks </strong>- from building real applications to understanding how Hooks work under the hood. It’s designed for <strong>companies and teams</strong> adopting modern React standards as well as <strong>individual developers</strong> who want a fast, thorough way to level up.</p><p><strong>Why Companies and Teams Choose This Course</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Standardizes modern React across a team:</strong> Focuses on function components, Hooks, and React 18 conventions used in production codebases.</p></li><li><p><strong>Project-based, measurable outcomes:</strong> Learners ship two concrete apps (Home and Reaction), plus targeted exercises that map directly to day-to-day frontend work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Engineering depth, not just API usage:</strong> “Hooks Under the Hood” builds a mental model of the React runtime-critical for debugging, reviews, and long-term maintainability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flexible for varied experience levels:</strong> Optional sections in <strong>Next.js/React 18+</strong> and <strong>In-Depth JavaScript</strong> support mixed-level cohorts without slowing advanced developers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Built for busy teams:</strong> Short, focused lessons with immediate application; easy to integrate into onboarding, upskilling, or refresher programs.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Student Reviews</strong></p><ul><li><p>“The author of this course does a fantastic job explaining hooks - even for someone like me who came into this already writing some basic useState and useEffect hooks in my projects. I also really enjoyed coding along and solidifying my understanding. The explanation and examples for custom hooks are the best I've encountered so far. Really well done!”</p></li><li><p>“Really enjoying the material. Overall, I see the big picture and most of the smaller details too… Learning a lot!.”</p></li><li><p>“This was an EXCELLENT course for me. I got the basics from short YouTube clips, but I had struggled to deeply understand hooks - particularly useContext and reducers. I decided to roll up my sleeves and spend some time getting a solid understanding. I had a lot of fun with the practice assignments, too.”</p></li><li><p>“The course is very well composed. Clear and simple explanations, good amount of deep-dives, great balance between design and coding parts.”</p></li></ul><p><strong>What You’ll Learn</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Core Hooks, immediately useful</strong></p><ul><li><p>useState, useEffect, dependency management, effect cleanup, functional state updates.</p></li><li><p>Build <strong>Home</strong>: a start-page app with search, live jokes, and a Hacker News feed</p></li><li><p>Create <strong>custom hooks</strong> (e.g., useFetch) to share logic cleanly</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Hooks Under the Hood</strong></p><ul><li><p>How React schedules renders, tracks Hook call order, and reconciles the DOM</p></li><li><p>Solve “one render behind” pitfalls, stale closures, and effect dependency bugs with confidence</p></li><li><p>Persist and hydrate state with localStorage, intervals, and controlled re-runs</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Advanced Hooks in Real Architecture</strong></p><ul><li><p>useReducer for scalable state transitions</p></li><li><p>useContext and custom context hooks to avoid prop drilling</p></li><li><p>Build <strong>Reaction</strong>: a multi-user message/reaction board using the reducer pattern; extend with Pub/Sub networking (PubNub) for real-time updates</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Optional Extensions for Advanced Teams</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Next.js + React 18+</strong>: server/client components, server actions, Suspense, useTransition, useDeferredValue, deployment to Vercel</p></li><li><p><strong>In-Depth JavaScript</strong>: closures, prototypes, async/await, and the event loop-everything React relies on beneath the surface</p></li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Course Projects and Deliverables</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Home (Hooks Essentials):</strong> A polished mini-app that exercises useState, useEffect, data fetching, and a reusable useFetch hook.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reaction (Hooks at Scale):</strong> A multi-user board with useReducer and useContext, then optional real-time Pub/Sub. Demonstrates patterns used in professional React apps.</p></li><li><p><strong>Next.js Portfolio (Optional):</strong> A production-style Next.js project employing React 18 features and modern routing, with deployment.</p></li></ul><p>Each project is structured to be <strong>code-review friendly</strong> and <strong>portfolio-ready</strong>, making outcomes easy to evaluate for managers and leads.</p><p><strong>Outcomes You Can Expect</strong></p><ul><li><p>Engineers write idiomatic, Hooks-first React that is easier to reason about and maintain.</p></li><li><p>Teams gain a shared vocabulary for effects, dependencies, reducer patterns, and context design.</p></li><li><p>Developers debug React issues faster by understanding the runtime, not just the API.</p></li><li><p>Learners graduate with deployable projects and reusable patterns ready for production work.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Who This Course Is For</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Frontend engineers and React developers</strong> moving from classes to Hooks or standardizing on modern patterns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Teams and companies</strong> adopting a consistent, current React approach for onboarding or upskilling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Developers from other frameworks</strong> transitioning into React and modern state management.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ambitious learners</strong> who want to understand how React really works-and ship real applications.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><ul><li><p>Comfortable with HTML/CSS and basic JavaScript.</p></li><li><p>Node.js and a code editor (VS Code recommended).</p></li><li><p>Includes targeted JS refreshers and an optional <strong>In-Depth JavaScript</strong> section for deeper mastery.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Instructional Approach</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Do first, explain deeply:</strong> Short lessons, immediate coding, then under-the-hood reasoning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Production mindset:</strong> File structure, effect hygiene, reducer organization, and component boundaries.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optional depth for mixed cohorts:</strong> Advanced sections that don’t block learners who need the essentials.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Build Modern React with Clarity and Confidence</strong></p><p>Whether you’re selecting a <strong>team curriculum</strong> or investing in your own skills, this course delivers a focused, modern path to React Hooks mastery-grounded in real projects, durable mental models, and production-ready patterns.</p><p>Let’s get started!</p>",

  "description": "<p><br></p><p><strong>WELCOME TO MY \"COMPLETE E-COMMERCE COURSE - JAVA, SPRING, HIBERNATE AND MYSQL\"!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>This is a course about building a E-Commerce website using <strong>modern Java Full Stack </strong>technologies. Specifically, it's about building an <strong>online bookstore</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>It's about bookstore, but the <strong>modules developed in the course is similar for all E-Commerce website</strong>. Those modules contains:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- User Signup and Login</strong></p><p><strong>- User profile management</strong></p><p><strong>- Product Management</strong></p><p><strong>- Shopping Cart&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>- Order checkout and order history</strong></p><p><strong>- Automatic email confirmation</strong></p><p><br></p><p>As you can see, those modules are the basics for pretty much any E-Commerce website.&nbsp;Check out the preview lesson for a <strong>quick tour of the website</strong>!</p><p>From the architecture perspective, the system is divided into two parts - <strong>Bookstore</strong> and <strong>AdminPortal</strong>. Bookstore is the front-end website that customer will be using for submitting orders while AdminPortal is used for administration purpose. Presumably they will be running on two servers. The good side is the two apps are decoupled in some way so that they can be managed separately. The drawback would be that we need to maintain two copies of the code. We can see that throughout the course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why should I take this course?</strong></p><p>Because you probably won't find another course out there on&nbsp;similar topic with similar length and detail.&nbsp;This course covers a wide range&nbsp;of topics on building an e-commerce website&nbsp;. It is a step-by-step guide with most of the code hand typing.&nbsp;</p><p>There are students from my other courses complaining that if I copy and paste the code and then explain it, tough it can save some time,&nbsp;students will lose track and drive. That's why I'm developing stuff in this course from scratch and step-by-step.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What does the technology stack look like ?</strong></p><p>As this is a full stack development project, we will develop the code for both&nbsp;front-end and backend. A considerable amount of work will be on developing the front-end code using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Thymeleaf, bootstrap and etc. Thymeleaf is the latest Java template engine, which is supposed to replace previous JSP way (JSP is discontinued but is still being used out there)&nbsp;and it is the official template engine backed by Spring Framework, though it's not the only one you can choose. The backend side will be using latest Spring technologies -&nbsp;Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data and etc. Then, we will have MySQL as database. MySQL is powerful and free to use and serves as a good database candidate in plenty of commercial apps out there.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Will I get the source code?</strong></p><p>Source code and database scripts are provided in the very beginning of the course. Besides, throughout each lesson (I would say most lessons), the source code will be provided to the progress of the lesson. Yet, I&nbsp;still suggest you to develop with me and take the source code as a reference.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What will I get by the end of the course?</strong></p><p>This course shows an example of building an E-Commerce app from scratch. By the end of the course, you will get exposed to various topics and building modules that you need for a basic E-Commerce web app. With the hands-on practice, you will gain a lot of experience that is beyond just the theory. Nevertheless, you can potentially deploy this web app on Heroku as a showcase (see my other course on deploying Spring Boot app on Heroku). This will definitely be helpful during interview if you can showcase this app.</p>",

We have also included source code of simple but complete project to get the participant knowledge of how ASP.NET can be used in web development.</p>\n\n<p>To overcome the mental block of many, who for some reason, feel classroom based training is better than our online ASP.NET Training, we ensure that all your queries are resolved on timely manner and if needed, you can meet our subject matter experts on <strong>SKYPE</strong> to clarify any questions you may have.</p>",

As more and more people live and work on the internet, developers need to make an effort to build robust, adaptive applications that can keep up with the fast pace of business.</p><p>In the 2000s, it was perfectly acceptable for a page to be static. Imagine you're working with a product inventory application. Are other people working against the same data? Can you be sure the current price of the product is valid? Did it change? How would you even know? Refresh the page to load updated data and see.</p><p>What if the page could... update itself? In real-time?</p><p>Once upon a time, this was a complicated solution to implement in a performant manner. Today, it's as simple as creating a WebSocket!</p><p>How do you manage thousands or millions of WebSockets across multiple servers? Reliably? What if the environment cannot support a WebSocket connection? What do you fall back to?</p><p>SignalR is a library for .NET which allows developers to add real-time capabilities to their applications. It provides a framework for managing connections from various clients, including web pages, mobile apps, desktop applications, and more.

  "description": "<p><strong>Are Your Website Visitors Seeing “Not Secure” in Their Browser?</strong></p><p>It’s a bit unnerving, right? You’ve put time and effort into building your website, but when visitors land on your page, they might see that dreaded “Not Secure” warning. In today’s world, where online security is more important than ever, that little message can seriously impact how much people trust your site.</p><p><strong>Trust is Everything</strong><br>Imagine this: a potential customer visits your site, but instead of feeling reassured, they hesitate because their browser warns them about security. It’s not just a minor issue—it’s a deal-breaker. People are becoming increasingly cautious about sharing their information online, and a website that isn’t secure can instantly lose credibility.</p><p><strong>How to Know If Your Site Is Secure</strong><br>It’s easy to check. Just glance at the address bar of your browser. If your site is secure, you’ll see a little padlock icon—sometimes even the word “Secure” next to it. If it’s not secure, there’s no padlock, and some browsers, like Google Chrome, may even display “Not Secure.”</p><p>That’s not a good look.</p><p><strong>The Solution? SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)</strong><br>SSL is the industry standard for creating a secure, encrypted connection between a website and a visitor’s browser. You’ll know a website is protected when the URL starts with “HTTPS://” rather than just “HTTP://”—the “S” means secure.</p><p>Setting up SSL used to be a hassle, and it could get pretty pricey. But the good news? You don’t have to worry about that anymore. In my course, I’ll show you how to get a free SSL certificate, install it, and make your site secure—step by step. Plus, we’ll boost your site’s speed and security even further by connecting to Cloudflare, a powerful content delivery network.</p><p><strong>Here’s What You’ll Learn:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The importance of SSL and why it helps your website rank better on Google.</p></li><li><p>How HTTPS works and how to set it up correctly.</p></li><li><p>Tips on checking whether your site is already secure (some hosts set it up for you automatically).</p></li><li><p>How to update your site and make sure all your pages are fully secure.</p></li><li><p>Using Cloudflare to protect your site and boost performance.</p></li><li><p>Handling mixed content issues and fixing them to maintain full SSL security.</p></li><li><p>Updating Google Analytics and Search Console after transitioning to HTTPS.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why This Course Is Different:</strong><br>I know that technical stuff can feel overwhelming, so I made this course hands-on and beginner-friendly. I’ll walk you through every step using one of my own sites as an example. You can follow along and see exactly how it’s done. At the end, I’ve included a complete conversion from start to finish in a single video—no guessing, just clear guidance.</p><p><strong>Ready to Make Your Site Secure?</strong><br>Join me, and let’s make sure your website shows that reassuring padlock—so your visitors know they can trust you.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>JAN 2023 UPDATE - This course has been completely updated to use Gatsby v5 &amp;&nbsp;Headless WordPress with Gutenberg blocks / WordPress block editor.</strong></p><p><strong>Do you want to improve your React JS skills and increase your value as a front-end developer?</strong></p><p>- \"Gatsby lets you build blazing fast sites with&nbsp;<em>your data</em>, whatever the source. Liberate your sites from legacy CMSs and fly into the future.\"</p><p>Level-up your React skillset by learning Gatsby.js with a WordPress backend! Gatsby JS uses React JS and GraphQL to generate and build static pages from a given dataset. This course will look at setting up WordPress as a headless CMS while using GatsbyJS to generate a blazing-fast server-rendered React website from WordPress data using the NEW WordPress block editor (otherwise known as the Gutenberg block editor). We'll building out custom posts, pages, menus, media, advanced custom fields, (and more!) using GraphQL to query that data.</p><p><strong>That's right, we can actually query Wordpress data using GraphQL!</strong></p><p>This course will cover Gatsby v5 with WordPress (using the NEW Gutenberg block editor). We'll create \"The Gatsby Garage\" in this course; a fictional classic car garage that buys and sells classic cars. While building this site we'll be covering <em>so many</em> different features of both Gatsby <em>and </em>WordPress.</p><ul><li><p>We'll style our site using Tailwind CSS.</p></li><li><p>We'll dive into WordPress development by creating our own custom Gutenberg blocks using ACF Pro.</p></li><li><p>We'll implement forms where we'll store form submissions directly in WordPress using Contact Form 7 and Flamingo.</p></li><li><p>We'll implement dynamic searching of cars.</p></li><li><p>We'll deploy a live, production version of our site.</p></li><li><p>Plus <strong><em>so much more!</em></strong></p></li></ul><p>This is the <strong>ONLY</strong> resource available online that covers using Gatsby &amp; WordPress in this way.</p><p>It's recommended you have rudimentary knowledge of React. We'll be covering everything else from Gatsby.js, Wordpress, GraphQL, and Tailwind CSS!</p><p><strong>What other students are saying about this Gatsby &amp; WordPress course:</strong></p><p><strong>5/5 stars </strong>-<strong> </strong><em>\"Tom is a really nice guy with a good voice. His course is to the point and his response to the Q&amp;A is awesome. I really like the fact that this course is not that long and shows you the endless possibilities that you can do with both Gatsby and the Wordpress API. For me this is a really good starting point in transforming a couple of websites without a CMS into a website with CMS\" - </em><strong>Edwin Boon</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>5/5 stars</strong> - <em>\"Tom's course is concise, clear, and gives you a good example of how to leverage your knowledge of React into fluency working with Gatsby.\" - </em><strong>Rob Thorne</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>5/5 stars</strong> - <em>\"Straight to the point, no pep talkings, Tom delivers the course as a sharing-experience between two colleagues. From his experience, without pretensions of teaching but showing what he finds to be helpful, he drives the lectures smoothly intertwining react, graphQL and wordpress with gatsby in a minimalistic way that can be approachable by anybody. Don't expect complicated ract patterns as that's not the point; I really appreciate that from Tom, keeping the focus on the whole architecture, not react/wordpress/graphQL specific. Just be aware we are not talking about the old web patterns, so make sure you have a sound understanding of react, wordpress and REST APIs; and by his exposition, gatsby explanations will naturally fall in place almost unnoticeable; you will be using it already.\" - </em><strong>Tony Guerrero</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>5/5 stars</strong> - <em>\"I had no idea this was possible! I usually use React but have never used WordPress before, but I found this was really well articulated. Brilliant course - thank you!\" </em>- <strong>Carol Emma</strong></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Single-page applications are the way to go if you want to build state-of-the-art web applications. But if you look around, there are so many big frameworks out there that just seem to take ages to learn. Guess what, you don’t need a framework like Angular to build single-page apps. Plain JavaScript and jQuery do the trick and more importantly, you have to build a fast and reliable back end. And that’s what you will learn in this course.</p><p>The single-page app you will build in this course is a shopping list application that uses every <strong>CRUD </strong>operation with <strong>HTTP requests</strong>, calling a <strong>RESTful web service</strong> - using ASP.NET Web API 2 - which saves your data persistently in a<strong> SQL Server</strong> database.</p><p>Make yourself ready to learn some jQuery, HTML and CSS for the front end. And for the back end you will use Microsoft's <strong>ASP.NET Web API 2</strong> for the RESTful web service and <strong>Entity Framework</strong> with <strong>Code First Migrations</strong> to communicate with the database.</p><p>On top of that you will learn how to <strong>publish your single-page app</strong> to Internet Information Services (IIS) so that everyone can access your new single-page application.</p><p>Patrick, the author of this course, has built several web applications professionally as freelancer and employee and over the years he learned many things that you just don’t have to do to succeed in building a single-page application. This course will <strong>save you time</strong>, because you will learn the <strong>crucial and most important parts</strong> quick, so that you can get your single-page app out there in no time!</p><p>Sound’s good? Let’s get started!<br></p><p><strong>What kind of single-page application will be built?</strong></p><p>During this course you will learn how to build a complete single-page application by building a simple shopping list web application - an app that comes in quite handy for almost everybody. In this web application the user will start by creating a new shopping list. After that she will be able to add items to her list, check them off and delete them. If the user wants to access a certain shopping list, she can do so by adding the id of the list in the URL - which will be delivered by your web app, of course. That way the user is able to create the list at her computer and open it afterwards with her smartphone when she is actually in the grocery store.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What technology is used for the front end?</strong></p><p>There are so many frameworks out there that you simply don't need or are just too big to start learning how to build single-page applications. In this course you will learn the basics that you will also need to know when you want to <strong>understand how frameworks like Angular work</strong>. Because when you start with Angular for example, you might get results sooner or later, but maybe you won't know what actually <strong>happens under the hood</strong>. </p><p><br></p><p>In this hands-on course you will <strong>learn and understand the essence of single-page applications</strong> by using the following technologies:</p><ul><li><p><strong>HTML </strong>- You will build the application like any other website with plain old HTML.</p></li><li><p><strong>CSS </strong>- To change the appearance of the application you will use a little cascading style sheets.</p></li><li><p><strong>JavaScript </strong>- The foundation of every single-page application framework is JavaScript. You won't learn the whole language, of course, but you will know how to use JavaScript for your web application.</p></li><li><p><strong>jQuery </strong>- To make things a bit easier and quicker, you will use the most famous JavaScript library jQuery.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ajax </strong>- With the help of jQuery and Ajax you will make the actual calls to the web service which returns data from the database.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>What technology is used for the back end?</strong></p><p>The back end or server side will be implemented with<strong> .NET </strong>technologies. You will need a <strong>RESTful web service</strong> you will call from the front end, a framework that maps your C# models or classes to database tables and of course a database. The following technologies will be used for that matter:</p><ul><li><p><strong>ASP.NET Web API 2</strong> - It's the state-of-the-art framework that helps you build HTTP services easily. With Web API 2 you will build a RESTful web service that enables the front end (or any other client you want to reach in the future) to make all CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations by using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE HTTP requests.</p></li><li><p><strong>Entity Framework</strong> - An object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that allows you to map your C# models with actual database tables. This part is crucial to save your data persistently.</p></li><li><p><strong>SQL Server</strong> - At first the database you will use in this course is a file that will be generated by Visual Studio. But later on, especially when you want to publish your app to IIS and make it available to the world, you will use a SQL Server database.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>So far for the server-side. Don't worry, <strong>every technology is available for free!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>What tools do I need?</strong></p><p>The entire course uses the <strong>Microsoft stack</strong> to develop the single-page application - apart from the browser, which is <strong>Google Chrome</strong>. The following tools will be used and are <strong>totally free</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition</strong> - Most of the time you will develop the application in Visual Studio. It might help if you already know this IDE. Older versions of Visual Studio also work.</p></li><li><p><strong>SQL Server Express Edition</strong> - This will be your database. The Express Edition is available for free and absolutely suits your needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>SQL Server Management Studio</strong> - This application is perfect to manage your database. Don't worry, you will learn how to use it step by step in this course.</p></li><li><p><strong>Google Chrome</strong> - As mentioned above, during this course Google Chrome and its developer tools will be used to access the web application. But <strong>any other browser with developer tools available will also do the trick.</strong> This means you can also use Firefox, of course. Even Internet Explorer would work... but honestly, it's not recommended.</p></li><li><p><strong>Internet Information Services (IIS)</strong> - Not really a tool for developing the application but for publishing it. If you have no access to IIS you can still follow the steps of publishing and use the results later on with a Microsoft Hyper-V Server for free! Everything is taught in the lectures.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Why should I pay for this course although there are so many free tutorials available?</strong></p><p>A good question! Indeed there are lots and lots of tutorials available online that might get you the information you are looking for. The advantage of this course is that you will get this <strong>one big package out-of-the-box</strong>. You will see <strong>every single step</strong> from start to finish on how to build your single-page application. Starting from the front end, then building the <strong>perfectly fitting solution</strong> for the back end and even publishing it on a server. You can't miss anything, because you're able to <strong>watch the whole development process</strong>. And if something is still unclear, you can <strong>always ask a question</strong> in the forums. And if you are still not happy you can <strong>get your money back</strong> - no questions asked.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;We have added an EXTRA React course.</strong></p><p>As an enhanced version of Vue, Nuxt has more functionalities and is also easier to configure. With Nuxt, you can code less but do more.</p><p>You don’t have to be a Vue expert to study Nuxt. Just basic Vue knowledge is enough.</p><p>In the first section, we will create a Vue app using Vue CLI 3.</p><p>The file structure created by Vue CLI 3 is very similar to the one used in Nuxt. They even have the same mechanism of generating pages.</p><p>We will recreate the same app using Nuxt and show you the similarities between Vue and Nuxt.</p><p>Your previous Vue knowledge can help you quickly understand the working mechanism of Nuxt. Once you have understood how Nuxt works, you can master it in no time.</p><p>Our official Nuxt study includes five sections.</p><p>1. Nuxt basics</p><p>2. Nuxt plugins and modules</p><p>3. Nuxt routing system</p><p>4. Nuxt context</p><p>5. Data exchange with the backend program (Express.js)</p><p>At the end of each section, there will be an infographic article to help you review everything you just learned.</p><p>Each review is followed by a practice session where you will practice and apply everything you have learned by creating a real app. You will also learn many new skills in this process, including how to handle cookies and create a membership system.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>NestJS is a Node.js framework</strong> for building efficient, reliable, scalable server-side applications. Its structure is opinionated and draws inspiration from Angular. <strong>Nest has gained popularity</strong>; more than 3 million downloads on NPM weekly.</p><p><br></p><p>While I was<strong> learning NestJS</strong>, the <em>learning curve was very steep</em>. I wished there was a detailed and <strong>well-structured course</strong> that would make my<strong> learning path easy</strong>. That's why I came up with this course: so that other developers who are trying to learn NestJS do not have to go through such a steep learning curve. </p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>I can assure you that the \"NestJS Masterclass\" is the most detailed, extensive, well-structured, and in-depth course in the marketplace—period! </em></strong><em> </em>- There is no other course like NestJS Masterclass, Guaranteed!</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>NestJS Masterclass is a Practical Course!</em></strong><em>&nbsp; </em>We work together to <strong>build a REST&nbsp;API server-side application </strong>for a blog. We learn while we code this application, so all the examples in this course are <strong>real-world use cases.</strong> While programming this application, we will <strong>learn various NestJS features </strong>and <strong>dive deeper</strong> into the <strong>internal mechanics of NestJS</strong>. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Well-designed and Structured Curriculum</strong></p><p>While designing the curriculum of the NestJS masterclass, I have spent a lot of time and effort thinking and ensuring that this makes <strong>learning NestJS easy</strong> for my students. Here is a partial list of topics covered in the NestJS Masterclass and what you can expect to learn from each section.&nbsp; Refer to the curriculum section for a detailed list of all topics covered. </p><p><br></p><ol><li><p><strong>Understanding Modules: </strong>I introduce you to NestJS modules, how they work, the internal mechanics of how they are linked to each other, and various schematics that are used with modules, including services and providers. </p></li><li><p><strong>Validation And Pipes: </strong>This is a crucial section that explains how you can leverage packages like class validator and Pipes in NestJS to validate the incoming data to your application. </p></li><li><p><strong>Dependency Injection: </strong>Dependency injection is the backbone of the NestJS framework. We dive deeper into how it works and how to leverage it to ensure that your application remains modular. We work on all possible dependencies, including circular ones between modules.</p></li><li><p><strong>Documenting Code: </strong>We learn about NestJS's features, which let you document the API endpoints using Open API Specification and your application's source code using Compodoc. </p></li><li><p><strong>TypeORM and Relational Databases:&nbsp;</strong>TypeORM has a close integration with NestJS.&nbsp;We use PostgreSQL in the REST API application we build and learn how to leverage all features of TypeORM while building a real-world application. </p></li><li><p><strong>Database Relations: </strong>This section teaches you about relationships in SQL databases and how to use TypeORM to set them. This includes one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. It is a detailed and well-designed section that eliminates all misconceptions about database connections. </p></li><li><p><strong>Configuration Environments In NestJS:&nbsp; </strong>Applications often run in different environments. Depending on the environment, different configuration settings should be used. NestJS&nbsp;has a well-designed system for managing configurations. </p></li><li><p><strong>Exception Handling: </strong>Elegantly handling exceptions within an application is crucial, as it improves the experience of developers and application users. We look at features NestJS provides that help us handle exceptions within an application. </p></li><li><p><strong>Database Transactions: </strong>Database transactions are important when you want to perform CRUD operations, which impact multiple entities simultaneously and are interdependent. We dive deeper into TypeORM transactions to see how they can be used with NestJS.&nbsp; </p></li><li><p><strong>User Authentication with JSON Web Tokens: </strong>We work on building a user authentication system using JWTs and learn the mechanics behind a secure and well-designed System. </p></li><li><p><strong>Guards and Decorators: </strong>Guards and Decorators are a few of the important schematics offered by NestJS. We use Guards to filter out unauthorized requests and decorators to set meta-data and attach payloads to incoming requests. </p></li><li><p><strong>Google Authentication: </strong> Modern applications are interconnected and usually offer an easy signup process using services like Google OAuth. We use Google Authentication along with the JWTs Authentication service we create for the NestJS application we build. </p></li><li><p><strong>File Uploads:&nbsp; </strong>Most applications need a file upload mechanism for users to upload files to the server and use them later. We learn about NestJS Interceptors and how they can be used to upload files to NestJS. </p></li><li><p><strong>Unit and End-to-End Testing: </strong>NestJS has been developed to keep the code you write modular so you can test it quickly. To live up to this practice, I have created dedicated modules for unit testing and end-to-end testing in NestJS for this course. </p></li><li><p><strong>Mongoose and MongoDB: </strong>Many times, you need to use NoSQL databases like MongoDB with the NestJS application.&nbsp;We do exactly that in this section. So, no matter which database you want to use, NestJS Masterclass is a perfect fit. </p></li><li><p><strong>Deployment to AWS: </strong>We examine all the intrinsic details of deploying a production application to AWS. We also explore using CloudFront CDN and S3 buckets to upload and serve media files for our application. </p></li><li><p><strong>And lots more ...</strong></p></li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p><p>I will give a quick introduction about myself I am Manik and I am a full stack developer and working as one since last fifteen years of my life. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why did I choose to teach&nbsp;NestJS?</strong></p><p>NestJS is a robust framework that is very close to my heart. For the last four years, I have been working on It. I have developed and maintained an application using NestJS, which has more than <strong>One Million Hits </strong>daily.<strong> </strong>I had a tough time learning NestJS due to the lack of tutorials, and that's why I decided to make this course so that I can teach what I have learned throughout all my years working with NestJS. </p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>***Quizzes, Hands-On Practices and Unique Projects are Included***</strong><br></p>\n\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</strong> is a popular<strong> language independent,</strong> <strong>data interchange format.</strong> <strong>JSON has significantly improved server-to-browser communications, especially when it comes to AJAX</strong>. <strong>Most of today's APIs return the response in JSON format </strong>as it is much easier to load, read and process JSON compared to XML, making it very popular. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>JavaScript Object Notation</strong> is text-based and human-readable</strong>. <strong>JSON is very easy to use with JavaScript as the syntax of JSON is a subset of JavaScript</strong>. Though it is a subset of JavaScript, <strong>JSON is language-independent</strong>. <strong>Most of the popular programming languages</strong> including PHP, Ruby, C#, Python etc.<strong> support JSON making it the widely used data interchange format</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Oliver says </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\"<strong>Excellent Course</strong>. <strong>I am learning easily all the concepts. Instructor explain with real examples.</strong> I have the feeling to be working online with the instructor. <strong>Very well explained.</strong>\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Rayvn Manuel says</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\"The repetition in the explanation really helps to remember and recall the information. <strong>The approach to the topics is gradual; meaning, starting from the basics and slowly introducing more. </strong>And<strong> I appreciate the comparison of technologies since its really helpful to understand why use one technology over another</strong>.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Ido Yogev says</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\"<strong>Very nice course, straight to the point. Topics are illustrated simple and professional form. Warmly recommended</strong> !!!\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\"<strong>JSON in Action: Build JSON-Based Applications\" is a 100% hands-on JSON (<strong>JavaScript Object Notation</strong>) course</strong>. <strong>By the end of this course, you will not only understand what JSON is, but also learn how to develop applications making use of real-world APIs that return JSON data</strong>. Just learning JSON syntax is not going to help you in anyways. You should be able to use JSON in the development process. Though AJAX and APIs do not come under the scope of this course, here <strong>we discuss how to use AJAX to contact APIs and then to collect the JSON result returned by APIs</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is structured as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the first section, you will understand <strong>what JSON is, compare JSON and XML </strong>and also learn<strong> why JSON is not JavaScript Object</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the second section, you will understand JSON in more detail. You will learn <strong>JSON syntax rules</strong> and <strong>different data types (number, string, boolean, null, array and object) </strong>you can use in JSON data. You will also practise to <strong>identify different data types in real world JSON data </strong>and also to<strong> write JSON data on your own</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the next section, you will understand how easy it is to use JSON with JavaScript. You will learn how to <strong>use JSON.parse and JSON.stringify methods</strong> to convert JSON data to JavaScript objects and JavaScript objects to JSON strings respectively. You will also learn how to get the required information from the available JSON data. You will understand the difference between <strong>dot notation and bracket notation</strong>. You will also learn how to use <strong>XMLHttpRequest object </strong>to fetch the .json file from a server.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The fourth section explains <strong>how to use AJAX techniques to contact an API</strong> and to <strong>collect the JSON output returned by the API</strong>. You will learn how to contact the API using GET or POST methods and also making a synchronous or asynchronous requests. You will also see how you can pass JSON as the input to an API.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the next section, we discuss how to <strong>use JSON with PHP</strong>. This lecture explains <strong>json_encode and json_decode </strong>methods. This section will be updated to teach you how to use JSON with other programming languages as well.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The last section is the <strong>Let's Develop</strong> section where you are going to apply your JSON knowledge to develop some applications on your own. Now there are two applications in this section.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Currency Converter</strong></li><li><strong>BMI Calculator</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The first application \"<strong>Currency Converter\" </strong>application contacts a real-world API, collects the JSON data, and performs currency conversion. The second application \"<strong>BMI Calculator</strong>\" is a more detailed one. As part of this application, you will be developing a simple API using PHP. You will contact that API (which you designed on your own), collect the JSON response and then process it to get the result you want.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So, what are you waiting for? <strong>Join this 100% practical JSON course</strong> and start developing API-based applications on your own applying JSON knowledge.</p>",

This is an intermediate-advanced course aimed at developers with some basic programming experience with tools such ES6 JavaScript. </p><p>We move fast and introduce all the required topics to build highly dynamic, complex single page apps with Vue.js 3 and the new Composition API. </p><p>Unlike other courses, testing and design patterns are at the core of everything we do. We explore the new features Vue.js 3 brings to the table. Some of the things you'll learn:</p><p>- How to use and test new Vue 3 components with Cypress and Test Utils </p><p>- Building reusable modules using the new reactivity API</p><p>- TypeScript to create type safe applications</p><p>- Creating a complex, real-time markdown editor </p><p>- Integrating third party libraries from npm</p><p>- Implementing authentication and authorisation with JWT (JSON&nbsp;Web Tokens) and cookies</p><p>- Routing, include navigation guards with Vue Router 4</p><p>- Writing and testing complex interactions (Vitest, Vue&nbsp;Test Utils)</p><p>- A real back end with Express and TypeScript</p><p>This is an intermediate to advanced course; some basic programming knowledge is required. I respect your time and have packed as much content into the course as possible. Rather than explaining the same basic concepts 10 times over, move quickly and see the same concepts applied in different contexts to reinforce them.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Learn JavaScript the Right Way — From Scratch With Real Projects</strong></p><p>So you’ve learned some HTML and CSS — now you're ready to bring your websites to life. That’s where JavaScript comes in. </p><p>This is a <strong>JavaScript course for beginners</strong> who want to understand how the web really works — not just follow tutorials blindly.&nbsp; You'll go from the <strong>basics of JavaScript programming</strong> all the way to building fully interactive websites. </p><p>We start at the beginning — how to write and run JavaScript — and slowly build your confidence through <strong>real-world JavaScript projects</strong>, including a <strong>live form validation system</strong> you’ll create from scratch. </p><p>By the end of this course, you won’t just “know a bit of JavaScript” — you’ll be able to write your own logic, respond to user input, and create smart, interactive features using only <strong>vanilla JavaScript</strong>. </p><p>--</p><p><strong>What Makes This Course Different</strong></p><p>No libraries. No frameworks. No fluff.</p><p>Just <strong>pure JavaScript</strong>, explained simply, with <strong>step-by-step training</strong>, hands-on coding, and <strong>practical examples</strong> that apply to real projects. </p><p>You’ll write real code in a real editor. You’ll debug, test, and <strong>manipulate the DOM</strong> with confidence. And most importantly — you’ll understand <em>why</em> your code works, not just what to type. </p><p>--</p><p><strong>What You'll Walk Away With</strong></p><p>Once you finish this <strong>JavaScript fundamentals course</strong>, you'll know how to use JavaScript where it actually matters — in the browser, on real websites, with real users. </p><p>You'll be able to handle clicks, input fields, form errors, and animations. Whether it’s a small effect or a full <strong>form validation system</strong>, you’ll build it — and you’ll understand every line. </p><p>You'll stop guessing. You'll stop copying code you don't understand. <br>Instead, you’ll think like a developer. You’ll solve problems, fix bugs, and build with confidence — using clean, modern JavaScript. </p><p>--</p><p>You don’t need to be a coder to start. You just need curiosity, a browser, and a little bit of patience. </p><p><strong>Join now</strong> — and let’s turn your static pages into dynamic web experiences, one JavaScript function at a time.</p>",

  "description": "<p>As we all know, web development moves quickly. With frameworks like Angular 2 and React, we’ve seen a massive move in the industry from the imperative programming paradigm to the functional and <em>reactive</em> paradigms. To be successful in modern development, it’s <strong>paramount </strong>to have an understanding of how these paradigms work, and the tools that we can use to express them.</p><p>This course is an introduction to the core concepts of the reactive programming paradigm. We will use the <strong>RxJS </strong>(Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) library as a way to explore this mindset and develop an understanding of how to <em>think reactively</em>. Reactive Extensions are used by many companies - from Netflix to Microsoft and even Github!</p><p>Did you know that Angular 2 uses Reactive Extensions for its asynchronous operations? If Angular 2 is your goal, then learning RxJS is an absolute must!</p><p>Even frameworks that don’t use RxJS directly, such as Facebook’s React, are modeled after this paradigm - and integrate with it <strong>flawlessly</strong>.</p><p>If you plan on moving forward with modern development, reactive programming should be your next step. With the knowledge in this course, you will gain confidence in working with modern frameworks and libraries. Even if you’re not interested in writing web applications, the concepts here apply everywhere. Reactive Extensions itself has many ports to other languages that you can easily move between!<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>The concepts in this course offer a new way to reason about c</strong><strong>ode - </strong>and will apply no matter what language, platform, framework, or library you wish to use! If you want to be on the forefront of modern web development, then this course is your next step!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>What is this course covering?</strong></p><p>The course covers everything you need to become a blockchain developer. Students of this course will learn what Ethereum blockchain is and how it works on the base level and from a developer's perspective.</p><p>Students will learn what smart contracts are and how to create them. Smart contracts are going hand in hand with dApps(decentralized apps). The course covers them as well.</p><p>The front end for dApps covered in the course use React library and Next JS framework. CSS and design are built with the help of Bulma and Tailwind frameworks.</p><p><br></p><p>Three real-world applications are created in the course. <br><strong>Faucet Application: </strong>This straightforward app encompasses React JS, Solidity, and Ganache. It provides an introduction to the fundamentals.</p><p><strong>Marketplace:</strong> This advanced application involves Next JS, Solidity, and Ganache, along with deployment to an actual blockchain.</p><p><strong>Adopt Pet:</strong> A bonus section focusing on React JS, this section utilizes Hardhat to manage the smart contract and deploys it to the Polygon network.</p><p><strong>Solana NFT Minting App:</strong> This bonus section teaches you to build an NFT minting application on Solana using React, TypeScript, and the Metaplex Umi framework. You'll integrate Solana wallet adapters, create NFT metadata, and mint tokens on the Solana devnet.</p><p>Every part of application creation is well explained and documented.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Faucet application:</strong><br>The initial application in the course provides students with a hands-on experience to learn the fundamentals and core concepts of the Ethereum network.</p><p>The application's frontend is developed using the React library and the Bulma framework. The Truffle development environment and Ganache (a private blockchain) are utilized for smart contract creation.</p><p>The faucet application allows users to donate and withdraw funds from the smart contract. Users can interact with the smart contract through a website connected to the blockchain network via the Metamask wallet.</p><p>The primary objective of this first application is to provide a practical learning experience while covering the basics in an enjoyable manner.</p><p>The application addresses several essential questions, including:</p><ul><li><p>Understanding Ethereum, transactions, and the blockchain.</p></li><li><p>Exploring the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and its components like bytecode and storage.</p></li><li><p>Learning how to create smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps).</p></li><li><p>Discovering the process of integrating smart contracts with React.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Marketplace application:</strong></p><p>This application focuses on building an interactive marketplace where clients can purchase courses using Ether digital currency, allowing students to select their preferred products.</p><p>Having covered the basics in the previous application, the emphasis now shifts toward practical development within the Ethereum network. The topics become more challenging, and the lectures revolve around practical coding aspects.</p><p>The second application encompasses various features, including a marketplace page that displays real-time updates of Ether currency and course prices compared to the US dollar. Additionally, there is a dedicated modal window for placing orders, an email hashing solution to safeguard client privacy, an order view with filtering and pagination options, and more.</p><p>For the development of this application, the Next JS framework is employed, with Tailwind serving as the CSS framework. Next JS internally utilizes the React library, offering ease of use and default server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities.</p><p>While SSR brings numerous benefits, it also poses some challenges regarding integration with the blockchain. However, the entire integration process of Next JS with the blockchain is comprehensively covered, explained, and documented. The final application will be deployed on the Internet, and the smart contract will be deployed on the live Sepolia Test Network.</p><p>The notable topics covered in this application include:</p><ul><li><p>Integrating Next JS (with SSR) with Web3 and the blockchain.</p></li><li><p>Developing a more complex smart contract.</p></li><li><p>Implementing email hashing and order verification features.</p></li><li><p>Providing a testing solution that covers every aspect of the smart contract.</p></li><li><p>Enabling pagination and filtering for orders.</p></li></ul><p><br><strong>Adopt Pet Application:</strong></p><p>As an additional component, this section consolidates the knowledge you have acquired in the course and applies it to a React JS app. Hardhat is utilized for smart contract management, ensuring a clean and straightforward application architecture.</p><p>The emphasis is on minimal design and simplicity. By the end of this section, you will have the opportunity to deploy a smart contract to the Polygon blockchain.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is Ethereum?</strong></p><p>Ethereum is a technology that lets you send cryptocurrency to anyone, but in the first place, It also powers applications that everyone can use, and no one can take down. It's the world's programmable blockchain.</p><p>Ethereum builds on Bitcoin's innovation, with some big differences.</p><p>Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable so that you can use it for many digital assets – even Bitcoin!</p><p>This also means Ethereum is for more than payments. It's a marketplace of financial services, games, and apps that can't steal or censor your data. It's the Future.</p><p><strong>What is Solidity?</strong></p><p>Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs that govern the behavior of accounts within the Ethereum state.</p><p>Solidity is a curly-bracket language. It is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript, and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). </p><p>Solidity is statically typed and supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, among other features.</p><p>With Solidity, you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Solana NFT Minting App (Bonus Section):</strong></p><p>This bonus section introduces you to building NFT applications on the Solana blockchain. You'll create a React-based minting app using TypeScript and the Metaplex Umi framework, allowing users to connect their Solana wallet, upload artwork, and mint NFTs directly on the Solana devnet.</p><p><strong>Key topics covered:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Integrating Solana wallet adapters with React</p></li><li><p>Building NFT minting workflows using Metaplex Umi SDK</p></li><li><p>Creating NFT metadata following Solana standards</p></li><li><p>Handling blockchain transactions and wallet signatures</p></li><li><p>Working with decentralized storage for NFT assets</p></li></ul><p>By completing this section, you'll expand your Web3 development skills beyond Ethereum and gain practical experience with the high-performance Solana ecosystem. This broadens your ability to build NFT applications across multiple blockchain platforms.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to this Full stack course. This course is mainly based on <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>Angular</strong> and <strong>NativeScript</strong> but we will cover much more than just these frameworks. We will build full applications including backend restful API, front-end web app and mobile apps on both Android and iOS.</p><p>We will discover how to make a user authentication (register and login users), how to create a full CRUD (create, read, update and delete) and how to create our own endpoints. I will show how to communicate between the API and web app. We will discover how to style the application and restrict certain parts of it to authenticated users only. All that done with very popular frameworks. We will use javascript and python languages and basic knowledge of these is required.</p><p>This course is built from two kinds of sections: First is an introduction to the framework where I explain everything from scratch, and 2nd is a hands-on section to build a ready application. After finishing this course you will have both knowledge and also experience how to build a full-stack application using Django, Angular, and NativeScript.</p><p>Also, I will show you how to deploy back-end API and front-end web app on the production server absolutely for free. You don’t need to spend any money to put your full application live.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Fully up-to-date fall-2017</p><p>The Professional Ruby on Rails Developer with Rails 5 is the latest course brought to you by the creators of the <strong><em>best-selling Ruby on Rails</em></strong><strong><em> course</em></strong> on Udemy! Built by taking 2 years of feedback from thousands of students over multiple Rails courses - it provides the best introduction to Web Applications Development using the wildly popular Ruby on Rails framework. <strong><em>It takes you from beginner to expert in just 8 weeks!</em></strong> With <strong>Rails 5</strong> and the introduction of ActionCable you can now build <strong><em>realtime features</em></strong> like chatrooms with ease and we'll show you how! This course is for students of all levels and backgrounds, those who have no experience in programming at all, those who have worked with other web app development frameworks but want to make the switch to or try Ruby on Rails and also for students who have tried Ruby on Rails in the past but want to take their skills to the next level, just to name a few.</p>\n\n<p>Why Ruby on Rails? Since its introduction, Ruby on Rails has rapidly become one of the most powerful tools for building web applications for startups and existing software houses. Some of the top sites using Ruby on Rails are Basecamp, Twitter, Shopify, Github, LivingSocial, Groupon, Hulu, Airbnb, Yellow Pages and much more. <strong>It's perfect for entrepreneurs or startups looking to rapidly prototype their ideas and bring them to life.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course provides a very structured approach of teaching Rails and how to use Rails to implement ideas. It teaches the techniques to make the code work for the student. There will be<strong><em> video lectures, text follow-up lectures after each video lecture, homework, challenge projects and monthly code challenges</em></strong>. There will be references to free resources available on the internet to supplement the course materials. <strong><em>There is also a live chat channel where students from all our Rails courses hangout and help each other out with questions, solutions and general networking</em></strong>!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A big focus of this course is practice and understanding fundamentals. Most of the code is done from scratch limiting the use of shortcuts, generators and absolutely no scaffolding or \"magic\". This is also accomplished by diving right in and using a pre-configured Ruby on Rails development environment in the cloud eliminating time required to setup a local development environment and the roadblocks that go with it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Some key aspects of this course are:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Realtime Chatroom and Comments feature using ActionCable!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Rails 5 using free cloud-based Integrated Development Environment</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Live chat help from other students, you're joining a community of developers who will help you ease your way in!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Working with git for version control and github as code repository</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- <strong>20 hours</strong> of high quality content with text lectures after every video lecture with code and directions</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Help from <strong>professional Teaching Assistant</strong> in the Q &amp; A section and also in the live chat!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Rails MVC structure in-depth - Models, Views, Controllers</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Conceptualization and Design</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Building own authentication system from scratch using default Rails stack, including admin feature, log in/logout and signup</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Working with Bootstrap for UI, Amazon Web Services for file/image hosting, Gravatars</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Test Driven Development (TDD) for majority of the application, introduced very early on. Build automated test suite side-by-side with the app featuring model (unit) and feature (integration) tests with the default rails testing framework</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Model and non-model backed forms, implementing like/dislike voting feature</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Migrations, one-to-many and many-to-many associations at the database layer and implementation using Rails and ActiveRecord</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- much, much more!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the HTML, CSS, and React Certification course for beginners. In this course you will learn how to develop stylish, mobile responsive web pages right from scratch using some of the most powerful front-end mark-up languages and JavaScript libraries. The course starts with an in-depth overview of HTML where we start by exploring the structure of an HTML web page. Once you’re comfortable with HTML foundations, we move on to demonstrating how to work with a number of HTML elements. This includes: Inline text elements, ordered and unordered lists, embedding media, link creation, tables, background images, form elements and iframes. The HTML segment concludes with a hands-on project that will guide you through creating a complete web page with headers, footers, callouts, images, links, forms and tabular data. By the end of the HTML segment, you’ll be able to proficiently code simple and complex html pages with ease.<br><br>The second section of this course focuses exclusively on CSS to bring your web pages to life with custom style sheets. Here, students will learn the importance of responsive design and cross browser compatibility by embedding CSS style rules for individual page components. We start by exploring the parts, and types of CSS rules followed by an introduction into CSS Id’s and divisions. From there we move on to CSS margins, text properties, borders, transparency and text on top of images. Once you have a handle on the foundations we move on to more intricate CSS concepts including CSS positioning, CSS float properties, Link Styling, and z-indexes. Similar to the HTML section, the CSS segment concludes with a comprehensive hands-on guide to building a responsive web page, complete with CSS style definitions, element containers, navigation, and a number of other CSS page elements.<br><br>Once you have a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, we will dive into working with React, a powerful JavaScript library used for front-end UI development. The React section starts off with a hands-on project where you’ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities.<br><br>In the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of “context” in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.<br><br>As you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it’s co-authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he’s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance. Tim has a genuine passion for teaching others how to become better coders and looks forward to interacting with his students.<br><br>With that said, we hope you’re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit that enroll button and let’s get started.</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>There’s no way around it. If you want to gain a competitive edge in UI/UX design, web development, or anything to do with mobile and desktop web apps, then you need to know Angular JS. Better yet, you need to know Angular 2, the latest version. This Angular 2 crash course will refresh your memory and get you updated on the essentials of the latest version. And if you’re just getting started with Angular JS, don’t worry this is the perfect introduction too.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Get Up to Speed with Angular 2 </strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Understand Angular 2 and how it can help you as a developer</p></li><li><p>Code an Angular 2 project with an online IDE</p></li><li><p>Get to grips with Angular 2’s many powerful features</p></li><li><p>Improve your UI/UX design and development skills</p></li><li><p>Discover what’s new in the latest version of Angular</p></li></ul><p><strong>Upgrade your Programming Skills </strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>With 71 lectures and 5 hours of content, this Angular 2 online course will give you a thorough understanding of how Angular 2 solutions are designed, administered, and developed. If you’re a web, mobile or service app developer, architect, UI designer, tester or administrator, or if you just want to know how to get Angular 2 projects up and running, then this is the course for you. \n\n&nbsp; </p><p>You don’t need any Angular 1 or UI experience to take this course, although if you’re familiar with creating web UIs with normal JavaScript tools (jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.), or object-oriented scripting languages like Java, C#, Python etc., you’ll already have a head start. \n\n&nbsp; </p><p>The course will begin with an introduction to TypeScript, the Cloud9 IDE and using Angular 2 modules. Then you’ll get stuck into Angular 2’s components, building a UI and binding your data. After that things get a little more challenging with a breakdown of advanced component concepts and component composition. From there you’ll jump into services, web services, and routing before setting up Angular 2 from scratch. \n\n&nbsp; </p><p>By the end of this course you’ll be able to set up and get going on your own Angular 2 projects quickly, easily, and efficiently.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>About Angular JS</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications. It’s a structural framework that allows you to use HTML as your template language, and is JavaScript based. It has many high-power features like data binding and dependency injection that eliminates huge chunks of coding for the developer, making the process much more efficient and streamlined.&nbsp; It’s mostly maintained by Google and a wide network of users. &nbsp;Angular 2 is the latest version of the framework, first released in September 2014.</p><p><br></p>",

We also learn how to setup tailwind in our web project.</p><p><strong>Section 2: Tailwind CSS Basics.</strong></p><p>Before jumping into building projects, we first get acquainted with Tailwind basics. We learn how to use containers, flex box and grid layouts to place elements on webpage. We learn how to add margin, padding and spacing between these elements just by using Tailwind utility classes.</p><p>We also learn how to add borders, shadows and border radius to elements like buttons.</p><p><strong>Section 3: Building A Fully Responsive Real Estate Portal.</strong></p><p>After learning Tailwind CSS basics, we jump into building a real-estate portal using tailwind. We build a responsive navigation bar, a site banner with buttons which. adjust itself as per breakpoints. We also learn how to create card components to display property images and property details in a modern way. We also create a client testimonial section using the card layout in which the cards are fully responsive. Finally we create a contact form and a site footer to wrap up the project.</p><p><strong>Section 4: Building A Modern Admin Dashboard.</strong></p><p>In this section we learn how to build a modern looking site administrator dashboard which displays statistical data with dynamic charts. The entire dashboard will be built with pure Tailwind CSS utility classes. </p><p><br></p><p>So let's begin the journey of becoming a<strong> Tailwind CSS expert.</strong></p><p>In addition to the <strong>Udemy</strong> <strong>30-day money back guarantee</strong>, you have my personal guarantee that you will love what you learn in this course.

This course covered different aspects and applications of WordPress management for business purposes from technicalities to practical business-oriented tips. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for refreshing or acquiring knowledge on WordPress CMS and, even more, to who is eventually considering the idea of launching a private web development business through one of the most known, used and powerful tool available in the market.\" --Riccardo A.</em></strong></p><p><strong>No better time than now, and only increasing</strong></p><p>With WordPress powering more than 40% of all websites on the internet, there's never been a better time to build an income and a business around it. Learn the most current and modern best practices with WordPress design, hosting, management and business processes outlined in detail.</p><p>You're here because you want to master WordPress, right? Good idea. You're in the right place. And, you can do it without learning any programming or coding.</p><p>While WordPress is open source, and because of that has thousands of developers building resources for it, it still takes quite a bit of learning to become a master at building and managing websites with it. It's not just learning the WordPress software, there's a small amount of graphic design knowledge needed, hosting and server management, troubleshooting broken sites or problems by hacking into the back end and server setup, and properly staging development environments around new sites or when performing updates and changes on existing sites.</p><p><strong>Why am I qualified to teach you?</strong></p><p>Through this course, I'll teach you everything I've learned and mastered through 16 years of building, managing, migrating, and hosting WordPress websites.</p><p><strong><em>\"He is concise and well spoken, without dumbing it down at all. As a total newbie to WordPress, I'm thankful he's offering this! 3 lessons in and it's great so far.\" --Jamie Rasmussen</em></strong></p><p>My business lets me work on my own schedule, manage my home workspace without a boss or a manager, and gives me an unlimited ceiling for profit and income and time freedom.</p><p>Without learning to code or programming anything, I'm able to leverage what's already been done with WordPress to create modern, robust and functional websites for clients of all types.</p><p>I'm hoping you'll get to the same awesome place in your work life. Let this course give you the head start you need to increase your income fast.</p><p><strong><em>\"[Gregg] has covered more areas than what an average course would deliver, this is clear reflection of Gregg's experience in&nbsp; the subject. He has gone above and beyond to cover every aspect of&nbsp; WordPress for a clear and concise understanding for a beginner. </em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Gregg is probably one of the best instructors I have come&nbsp; across on Udemy and expert in the subject. Well done and Thank you for&nbsp; an amazing course.\" </em></strong></p><p><strong><em>--Mohamed Fawmey Mohamed Vinodh</em></strong></p><p>Many of my best and biggest clients have come from \"abandoned\" WordPress websites, where the client's website designer or developer has left the scene. My ability to get in and restore, fix, redesign, and continue to manage WordPress websites brings me lots of instant and recurring income.</p><p>You'll learn how to do all this in more than 18.5 hours of easy-to-follow video content, fun lessons and challenges.</p><p>During this course, you'll learn everything you need to know to start or improve your own WordPress website business.</p><p><strong>The WordPress Ecosystem</strong></p><p><strong><em>\"Straight forward and neat! Just what I need to step up the freelancing ladder. Highly recommended.\" --Mr. Graciano Jose Reyes</em></strong></p><p>It's probably no surprise to you that the WordPress community has thousands of really talented and creative developers, designers and technologists working within it. And you may know that much of their work is available as open-source resources that will enable you to build your own business.</p><p>The open-source philosophy doesn't mean that no one makes any money.

  "description": "<p>From this course, you can learn <strong>OWASP&nbsp;Top 10 Web API&nbsp;Security.</strong></p><p>There are a lot of other courses on this topic. <strong>So, why would you choose exactly this course?&nbsp; </strong>Here are just a few reasons:<br><br><strong>- Coding examples</strong></p><p>To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO&nbsp;and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you. Probably you always dreamed about running your startup?&nbsp;In this course, you will be able to find the team who will teach you how to do that and (in particular cases) will be glad to help with implementation! </p><p>Hope you enjoy this course! And remember, we appreciate all your feedback! Your feedback will help us to become even better!&nbsp;Your feedback will help us to create to best Java course ever! </p><p>See you at the lessons!&nbsp;:)</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>In this course, you will build a chatbot for a Webpage.</strong> We'll use<strong> </strong>Node.js and <strong>React</strong> for programming and <strong>GIT</strong> for deploying and version control. The bot will be hosted on Heroku, but you can simply host it anywhere else where they support Node.js. We'll use <strong>DialogFlow</strong> to <strong>process natural language. </strong>DialogFlow will help us understand what users want.</p><p>In the course, we'll be building a <strong>sample chatbot</strong>. Its purpose is only to show you how things work. Our bot on the page will help us <strong>sell products</strong>. It will <strong>give recommendations</strong> and <strong>measure demand</strong>.</p><p>In the process of building this chatbot, <strong>you'll learn all that is needed to build a great bot</strong>. To get the most out of the course, you can work on this sample bot, and in the end, tweak it to suit your needs.</p><p>You need to have at least basic knowledge of <strong>Node.js and React</strong> to start with this course. For versioning, we use GIT; therefore, you need to be familiar at least with basic git commands.</p><p>To make it easier for you, I've added <strong>git commits</strong> with changes to every video that has a change in the code. This way, you can compare your code to mine. And you won't lose time debugging. And remember for any questions I'm available in the Questions and answers. You are not alone.</p><p>And remember,<strong> I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU</strong>.</p><p><em>The bot will be able to remember things, that is </em><strong><em>store information into a database</em></strong><em> </em>or <strong><em>connect to other API services</em></strong><em>. I'll show you </em><strong><em>different implementations</em></strong><em> so that you can play and find out what suits you most.</em></p><p><em>At the end of the course, you'll have a demo chatbot that you can tweak and tailor to your needs.</em></p><p><br></p><p>My name is <strong>Jana Bergant</strong>, and I'm a developer with <strong>over 20 years of experience</strong>. I'm an IT instructor teaching people new tech skills. <strong>Over 17000 people are already taking my course</strong>.</p><p>I help all my students at every step of development. And I'll be here for you!</p><p><em>Let me tell you a bit about every section of this course.</em></p><p>In the first section, we'll take an <strong>overview of the app</strong> and get familiar with <strong>the tech stack</strong>, which is the technology used in this course. We'll look at <strong>application architecture</strong> and different ways we can implement it. We'll go through every implementation. And I'll take you through the development stages.</p><p><br></p><p>The second section will introduce you to <strong>DialogFlow</strong>, a natural language processor, that we'll use to understand what our visitors want from the chatbot. We'll go through building blocks of DialogFlow. You'll learn about agents, intents, entities, parameters, prebuild agents, and more.</p><p><br></p><p>Then in the third section, we start building <strong>the server-side app for the chatbot</strong>. We'll install <strong>the Express library</strong> and generate an express app. After we are trough with configuration, we deploy it to <strong>Heroku</strong>. To speed up the development process, we'll set up a local development server called <strong>Nodemon</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>When you have a basic server-side app created, you'll be able to <strong>connect it to DialogFlow</strong>. And that is what we'll do in section 4.</p><p><br></p><p>And <strong>frontend</strong> will be the next step. In the fifth section, we<strong> </strong>set up React, configure local servers, create a proxy for communicating with the backend. And we'll develop components. Components for the page and for the chatbot. Our chatbot will begin to l<strong>ook like a chatbot</strong> in the 5th section.</p><p><br></p><p>But we'll polish it in the 6th section, where we'll create <strong>rich messages for the chatbot</strong> like cards and quick replies. And also, we'll go <strong>deeper into DialogFlow's features</strong>, like follow up intents, contexts, events, and slot feelings. Features that make bot creation much easier and much friendlier!</p><p><br></p><p>When our bot is polished, we can make it <strong>smarter</strong>. We want our bot to remember what the user says. Therefore we need to store information that we get from the user. In the 7th section, we'll be saving to the database and also use what we know about the user in a conversation. To make the bot friendlier. We like if people remember our preferences, it is the same with bots.</p><p><br></p><p>In the 8th section, I'll show you a different way to implement handling actions. We'll be using <strong>DialogFlow's fulfillment</strong>. I'll show you how to call fulfillment only for intents that need extra code to be run. Only for intents that need to get information from a database, or that need to call some other API, or maybe connect to a device.</p><p><br></p><p>When we master fulfillment, we'll <strong>deploy to Heroku</strong>. In the 9th section, we'll take care of some extra configuration like <strong>routing, postbuild scripts</strong> for generating frontend; we'll also go through the code and make sure all is as needed before we deploy.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, in the 10th section, I'll show you how to<strong> </strong>connect to DialogFlow straight from FrontEnd. To do that, we'll need to make some <strong>changes to the architecture</strong>. I'll tell you the benefits of every decision.</p><p><br></p><p>After the course, you'll have a <strong>demo bot that you can tweak and tailor to your needs</strong>. And you'll have the knowledge to upgrade it.</p><p>See you on the course!</p><p>Jana</p><p><br></p><p>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The last update of the course was on 27th February 2020</p><p>I added DialogFlow mega agents</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Why Learn HTML and CSS?</strong></p><p>HTML is the foundation of all web pages. Without HTML, you couldn’t organize text or add images or videos to your web pages. HTML is the beginning of everything you need to know to create engaging web pages! CSS Works in tandem with HTML to ensure that your content looks good. Using these two, you are in complete control of what your web pages look like. </p><p><strong>Why Learn JavaScript?</strong></p><p>HTML and CSS are static. JavaScript allows you to manipulate them while your webpage has already loaded. Imagine having an interactive document reading when their content can morph based on your actions...while you're reading it! That is what JavaScript brings to the table.</p><p><strong>Take-Away Skills</strong></p><p>Learn how to build a website using <strong>HTML, CSS</strong>, and <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>. </p><p>By the end of this course, you will have learned:</p><ul><li><p>How to create <strong>HTML Documents</strong></p></li><li><p>How to link HTML Documents and <strong>create a website</strong></p></li><li><p>How to insert elements in an HTML document (images, lists, tables, text, etc.)</p></li><li><p>How to style one or more pages with <strong>CSS</strong> (Inline, Internal and External Style sheets)</p></li><li><p>How to upload code to <strong>GitHub</strong>.</p></li><li><p>How to publish your static website to the internet using <strong>Netlify</strong>.</p></li><li><p>How to design a form to collect data.</p></li><li><p>How to write <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>jQuery</strong></p></li><li><p>How to use <strong>Bootstrap 5</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>Content and Overview</strong></p><p>You don't need to know any programming language to take this course. The content of this course assumes no prior knowledge of programming or web development. It will teach you how to set up an environment to develop a website from scratch and deploy it on the internet for the world to see. </p><p>This is a short course with just over 4 hours of content but smartly broken up to highlight related activities based on each module in the application being built. We will also look at troubleshooting and debugging errors as we go along, implementing best practices, writing efficient logic, and understanding why developers do things the way they do. Your knowledge will grow, step by step, throughout the course, and you will be challenged to be the best you can be.</p><p>By the time you have finished the course, you will have moved around in <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> and examined errors so much that it will be second nature for you when working in the Web development environment. This will put your newly learned skills into practical use and <strong>impress your boss and coworkers</strong>.</p><p>The course is <strong>complete with working files hosted on GitHub, including some files to make it easier for you to replicate the demonstrated code</strong>. You will be able to work alongside the author as you work through each lecture and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Bootstrap is currently the single most used library on all of Github, beating out other tools like React and Angular! It's immensely popular, and with good reason: it makes creating responsive websites a breeze.</strong></p><p>This course will&nbsp;take you from knowing nothing about Bootstrap 3 or 4 to learning all of the utilities, components, widgets and grids and building real world themes and websites.

I'm enjoying every second of this.</p><p>— PHILIP MURRAY</p><p>I have completed many Udemy and Skillshare tutorials. This one is the most outstanding one that I have seen thus far. It is doubtful that it could be topped. This is a superior tutorial. Amazing.</p><p>— JOSEPH APPLEGARTH</p><p><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</strong></p><p><strong>When does the course start and finish?</strong></p><p>The course starts now and never ends! It is a completely self-paced online course - you decide when you start and when you finish.</p><p><strong>How long do I have access to the course?</strong></p><p>How does lifetime access sound? After enrolling, you have unlimited access to this course for as long as you like - across any and all devices you own.</p><p><strong>What if I am unhappy with the course?</strong></p><p>We would never want you to be unhappy! If you are unsatisfied with your purchase, contact us in the first 30 days and we will give you a full refund.</p><p><strong>Do I get course certificates?</strong></p><p>Yes, a course certificate will be generated at the end of each course you complete! Along with projects, certificates are a way you can prove your work on LinkedIn.</p><p><strong>Do I have to show up at a particular place or a particular time?</strong></p><p>No, each course happens online, and you can take it from any place where you have an internet connection.All lectures are prerecorded so you can watch them at any time that works for you. Of course, you can also enjoy all the lectures on your phone and tablet.</p><p><strong>How much time do I need in order to take each course?</strong></p><p>You can spend as much or as little time as you want. With Lifetime Access, there is no expiry. You aren't required to complete the course within a certain time period. You can follow the course at your own pace and always come back to the videos later when you want to revisit the material or work on improving certain skills.</p><p><strong>What if I’m not good with technology?</strong></p><p>The majority of Mammoth Interactive students are complete beginners. Even if you feel like you know nothing about technology, you won’t feel left out. All technical concepts are described in simple terms while avoiding unnecessary jargon. Each course starts from scratch and builds up your knowledge substantially in steps. Students from age 5 to 70 have successfully completed our courses. And just in case you get stuck, you can always ask any questions under each lecture, which will be promptly answered by one of my team members.</p><p><strong>What if I'm an experienced developer?</strong></p><p>Stack Overflow's yearly developer survey found that developers over age 50 start to make less than their younger counterparts. Don't become one of the people affected by skill stagnation. Enroll in our school to future-proof your career for life. If you're an experienced developer, you will still benefit from Mammoth Interactive courses. By starting from scratch with each course, you will revisit the fundamentals and undo bad coding habits. You'll also find it easier to pick up new languages, making you able to take more courses and broaden your skillset.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>What is the best way to understand Dynamic Programming? Shall I directly jump to the problems or spent ample of time in understanding the underlying theory? How can I frame my thought process to achieve those elegant solutions by myself? </strong></p><p>Are these some of the questions that come to your mind?</p><p>If yes, then you are reading the description of the perfect course you intended for.</p><p>If you observe the recent trends, <strong>dynamic programming</strong> or DP(what most people like to call it) <strong>forms a substantial part</strong> of any <strong>coding interview</strong> especially for the Tech Giants like<strong> Apple, Google, Facebook</strong> etc.</p><p>We have spent a great amount of time collecting the most important interview problems that are essential and inevitable for making a firm base in DP.</p><p>In this course you will learn how to approach a DP problem and visualize the so called \"<em>sophisticated solution</em>\" for it. There are many problems discussed in this course which are of varying difficulty levels ranging from easy to medium level. And for each problem we have followed the same strategy to explain it. Firstly, we have the problem statement part where we clearly state the problem with a practical example. Then we have the intuition part where we start building our logic behind the approach by figuring out some patterns using our common sense and mental aptitude. Finally we have the pseudo-code and the sample illustration part which completes the whole journey. We believe this consistency in our approach will help the students to understand, visualize and conceptualize the problem solving approach firmly. By the end of this course he/she would be in a great shape to tackle a DP problem. </p><p>We will be moving at a slow and a steady pace introducing the main concept behind DP followed by example problems so that you can visualize and apply what you have learnt. </p><p>For students who are interested in practical implementation of the algorithm discussed in the video, <strong>we have provided C++ and Java codes as an additional resource</strong>.</p><p>Along with that, each problem is followed by a quiz or a coding assignment which we heavily insist everyone to try. These <strong>quizzes</strong> and <strong>coding</strong> <strong>assignments</strong> are there to check whether you have imbibed the true essence of the concept and are ready to apply it in any similar type of problem. We have provided the true solutions as well for the students to verify theirs.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? Just go ahead and enroll for this easy to understand course and get ready to nail those Tech-Giants coding interviews by mastering the art of solving a DP problem.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>This Course In a Nutshell - Part 1 Angular Service Worker <strong>(<em>includes the Typescript Jumpstart Ebook</em>)</strong></strong><br></p>\n\n<p>In the first part of the course we are going to <em>dive straight into the Angular Service Worker</em> and the built-in Angular CLI PWA support. We are going to take as the starting point a plain Angular Application, and we are going to start adding PWA features on top of it in order to turn it into a Progressive Web Application.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will start by adding the Angular Service Worker and have the <strong>Application Download &amp; Installation</strong> feature up and running. We will learn all about Application<strong> Version Management </strong>and we will learn about the multiple caching strategies available for caching not only the application bundles, but also the application data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will then add an <strong>Application Shell</strong> using the Angular CLI and Angular Universal, and make the application One-Click Installable using an <strong>App Manifest</strong>. Finally we will add Push Notifications to the application using the Angular Service Worker, for a complete mobile-like PWA experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This Course In a Nutshell - Part 2 - Service Workers Fundamentals</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this second part, you will learn about <em>Progressive Web Applications in general</em> (including <strong>Service Workers, App Manifest, and the Cache Storage API.</strong>), and you will use these APIs to implement several native-like features: One-Click Install, Offline support, application download and installation, application data caching and more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will also learn Service Worker Web Fundamentals from first principles using built-in browser APIs directly and we will confirm our understanding of what is going on in every step of the way using the PWA built-in Chrome Dev Tools.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The knowledge learned on this section has a long shelf live, as its about browser fundamentals and how the new PWA Web works in general, so everything learned here is still applicable to any other development platform other than Angular.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why PWAs? Build the Future Of the Web Today</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The future of the Web is clearly going in one direction: Progressive Web Applications! With the upcoming Safari support and the ability to install a PWA directly to a <strong>Windows desktop</strong>, PWAs are the new generation of web applications that will bridge the gap towards Native Apps: this will even include in the near future things like Bluetooth and Payments.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>PWAs look and feel like native apps, but there is no App Store and all its issues involved: instead a web application can now be installed directly to the user desktop or home screen with one single click!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The application will then install itself immediately on the background, so that it does not have to be downloaded again unless a new version is available.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The application will feel blazing fast in a way that until now only native apps could: A PWA is offline, background sync and notification capable.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PWAs are not mobile-specific:</strong> any application can benefit from starting up an order of magnitude faster! The Angular CLI PWA support and the Angular Service Worker take PWA features to another level: we will be able to add PWA features reliably to our application in a transparent way via the Angular CLI, as part of the production build process.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>But we will still need to understand how PWA features work under the hood, in order to troubleshoot any issues, interact with the Angular Service Worker or configure the Angular CLI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Course Overview</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In part 1, we are going to take PWA features one at a time.These features where designed to be used together, so using them to implement a concrete use case is the best way to learn them. The main component of a PWA is a Service Worker, so that is our starting point.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are going to<strong> learn all about the Service Worker lifecycle</strong>, how multiple versions of the service worker are handled by the browser, and we will learn multiple Service worker installation and activation GOTCHAs. We are then going to build a service worker that gives to an application the ability of showing an offline page when the network is down, using the Cache API.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the PWA APIs are Promise-based, so to make the code more readable we are going to be using Async / Await in our examples. We are then going to implement Application Download and Installation: we are going to see how we can use a Service Worker to completely download a version of the website into a user's mobile or desktop, and how to handle the installation of multiple versions of the application.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are going to demo the performance benefits of caching the complete application locally by simulating a slow network, and learn how to clean previous versions of an application. We will also learn how to cache UI-specific data and derived View Model data on the client side using Indexed DB and a Service Worker, and we will also earn how to implement Background Sync.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The next section of the course will cover all about the App Manifest and how to configure that one-click installation experience that we are looking for. After that, we will inspect our application with the Lighthouse tool and analyze the generated report.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The last part of this PWA fundamentals section will cover Web Push and Notifications. In this section, we are going to setup a node server with Web Push capabilities, and then we are going to link it to our service worker in order to implement mobile-like Notifications.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Will you Learn In this Course?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will learn how the PWA Browser features work in general, not only in the context of an Angular application. You will know how to analyze and troubleshoot PWAs using the Chrome PWA Dev Tools. You will also learn how to leverage the Angular Service Worker, and all the Angular CLI PWA features to build PWA-enabled web applications.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Will You be able to do at the End Of This Course?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will be able to design, develop and troubleshoot PWAs, plus you will know how to quickly add PWA features to an Angular Application leveraging the Angular CLI and the Angular Service Worker.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Have a look at the course free lessons below, and please enjoy the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>UPDATED June 7th, 2015 - </strong>Now Includes full download of this FULLY FUNCTIONAL website + DB + Web App located at<strong> http : // info lims . com</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>What is this course about?</strong><br></p>\n\n<p>This course is about Oracle's APEX framework which allows you to create modern, fully-functional web applications using nothing more than your browser.  Applications in APEX are configured and not coded.  But don't let that fool you.  APEX is modern and allows for advanced web programming if you want to get your hands dirty.  In this course we dive into the basics and intermediate level of APEX configuration.  There is no heavy coding in this course.  We use configuration and drag-and-drop in this course to get some pretty advanced functionality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What terminology would your audience expect to find in this course?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We cover all of APEX's terminology (Don't worry if you are not familiar)</p>\n\n<p>Table, Sequences, Workspace, Page, Page Designer, Application Builder, SQL Workshop, Exporting, Importing, Interactive Reports, Regions, Items, Buttons, Select Lists, List Managers, Template Options, Icon Classes, Shared Components, Authentication Schemes, Theme Roller, Dynamic Actions, Application Rollback, Team Development Module, Packaged Apps, Page Processes, Branching, Page Redirection, SQL, Query Builder, and so much more</p>\n\n<p>We also cover some web and database terminology (Would help to have a basic understanding)</p>\n\n<p>HTML, h1, h2, div, SQL, Select, From, Where</p>\n\n<p><strong>What kind of material are included?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The format for this course is watch and follow along.  You are given two options for following along:</p>\n\n<p>Request your own Oracle Workspace and follow along (Free)</p>\n\n<p>Install your own instance of Oracle XE and APEX (Free) on your Windows machine</p>\n\n<p>Both options are free.  The student is expected to complete all of the same exercises in the video.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long will the course take to complete?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The student should expect to dedicate 8 or more hours to complete the course.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How is this course structured?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Watch and follow along.  I take you from beginning to end with this course video series.  I will occasionally ask you to pause the video and complete a task to test your skills.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why take this course?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is nothing like seeing a developer in action and watching them build from beginning to end.  You can try and use a book or blog tutorial to get your knowledge about APEX.  But the experience with those formats could end up leaving you stuck.  APEX is the future of web application development.  If you think visually and would prefer to configure an application rather than get stuck in the weeds with code, take this course and get started on your next web app. </p>",

  "description": "<p>Laravel is the most popular framework for PHP and it really makes life easier! VueJs is also one of the easiest and most powerful javascript frameworks out there that uses a Virtual Dom.</p><p>With the Laravel framework, I&nbsp;have done huge projects before, and with Larvel it's easy to manage and maintain.</p><p>One of the most beneficial features of Laravel is the Model relationships you can use. Doing queries to the database has never been easier and powerful than now!</p><p>In this course, we will start from the beginning and tell you how to set up your first Laravel Project. I will also show you how to deploy your code online to a Virtual Private Server. We also teach you how to add your project to a DigitalOcean server online! </p><p>This is a must-have course if you're simply want to jump into Laravel and improve your skill! And if you have help, you can contact me through this platform in order to help you.</p><p>The online world today is booming, and online developers are in demand way more than previously.</p><p><br></p><p>The most common language used for online development is PHP, and Laravel is the most popular and probably the best one out there.</p><p><br></p><p>Laravel handles the server-side programming, so this basically means that it processes what it needs to do before it ends up in front of the client’s screen. So if you want some programming done client-side, then you can’t use Laravel, but Laravel integrates beautifully with Vue JS. Vue JS handles client-side programming. So for instance, if you want to build an application where you don’t want to refresh the browser in order to process something, you’ll be using Vue JS, which is one of the most popular and powerful Javascript frameworks out there.</p><p><br></p><p>With this course, I will teach you everything from where to start from scratch up until publishing your project to a live server where people can access your content.</p><p><br></p><p>As a bonus, I will also include my own built Content Management System, and I will teach you how to install it. With this CMS, you can instantly have an admin where you can log in and add pages, specials, products and more. This CMS is also going to be updated continuously, and I will update my course with all the latest changes to the CMS.</p><p><br></p><p>This Content Management System will also include an eCommerce section where you can list your products and prices.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will be really helpful for you, especially if you want to get in online application development, including websites.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

I think there are two keys to it's success. First, the app developed throughout the course is reasonably complex and whether its a particular look in CSS or behaviour in jQuery, it accurately reflects what modern apps really look like. Next, there is enough hands on coding in all the tools that it really begins to stick.

Probably you don't have enough experience with the tests, but it's ok, there's still a good way to learn it from the course. When you work with code and cover it with test cases, it provides you with guarantees that your code works as you expected. This is the purpose and benefit of the tests.<br>Tools for testing:&nbsp;<strong>Jest, Stryker, React Testing Library</strong></p><p>Also, I'll try to cover basic <strong>Typescript</strong> concepts and show you a way to improve these skills. During the coding sessions, we'll cover advanced Javascript techniques to make sense of commonly used JS features.<br><br>Storybook is the most popular way to build the components library. From our side, it's the most basic part of the course. We'll install and configure Storybook, which will provide us with a full components spec. This approach is called Components Driven Development.<br><br><strong>CSS-IN-JS, EmotionJS, and Styled-Components</strong> are very powerful toolkits to build UI&nbsp;components. Even very complex component styles can be easily produced and supported by it.<br><br>We'll introduce you to <strong>React Hooks</strong> - it's the basic way to make dynamic UI for the applications.</p><p>We'll make review <strong>React Router</strong> v5 and also React Router v6.</p><p><strong>GitHub Actions </strong>makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD.

  "description": "<p><strong>Take this course if you would like to learn how to use the Divi theme to build a modern, responsive, sophisticated website, all within the browser. No requirement to know HTML and CSS!</strong></p><p>Join me in this course and together we will build a 5-page website. Best of all, it will all be accomplished from within your browser.</p><p>We will be creating a website for a fictional web design company called Blue Fox Web Design. By following along with this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of the Divi theme, as well as learning techniques that will help you build better websites. </p><p><strong>What will I&nbsp;learn? </strong></p><p>Although we will be creating the website for a fictional web design company, the skills you will learn can be used for your future projects. Here are just some of the things you'll learn throughout the course:</p><ul><li><p>How to install and configure WordPress</p></li><li><p>The basics of Divi, including sections, rows and modules</p></li><li><p>Customising Divi's modules to effectively brand your website</p></li><li><p>Lots of different types of modules, including text, images, accordions, counters, and lots more</p></li><li><p>Amazing scrolling animations - make elements appear when the user scrolls to a certain point on the page</p></li><li><p>Hover effects - make your elements come to life when the user hovers their mouse over them</p></li><li><p>Using Divi's pre-made layouts to save you many hours&nbsp;of work</p></li><li><p>Navigating quickly and efficiently through the Divi interface</p></li><li><p>Adding contact forms, separators, Google maps, blogs, and much much more!</p></li></ul><p>If you're looking for the most feature-packed Divi course on Udemy, you've found it!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who are you? </strong></p><p>My name is David Sharkey; I have been using Divi for three years, and I've been a web designer for six years. I've used Divi in many real-world projects, and I'm excited to be able to share what I know with you. </p><p><strong>Who this course is for:-</strong></p><p>Coding a website in HTML and CSS is hard, and it takes a long time. If you are looking for a way to create high-quality, modern websites in a fraction of the time, then Divi might be what you've been looking for. </p><p>Divi's revolutionary Visual Builder makes designing webpages a fun, simple experience. Sections, rows and modules can be created in the blink of an eye, then duplicated, re-arranged and edited, all within the browser!&nbsp;</p><p>Websites that can take weeks to create using HTML&nbsp;or CSS&nbsp;can be built with Divi in a matter of hours. </p><p>There is no true substitute for learning HTML and CSS, but for projects that require a short turnaround time, Divi provides the tools for you to quickly achieve your goals. </p><p>You do not need to know how to code to take this course, but please note we will be using a few snippets of CSS when it's absolutely necessary. I will, however, provide the code which you can just copy and paste into Divi. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>****&nbsp;Student Feedback&nbsp;****&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"I have never managed to create a nice looking website using Divi, despite several tries, but with this course I am well on my way to having a website I can be proud of. 5 stars - highly recommended.\"</em></strong></p><p>- John Edwards<br><br><em>\"</em><strong><em>Great course. Every detail was shared on how to complete a stunning website. I am now feeling very confident to get my first one done. Thank you David.\"</em><br><br>- </strong>Megan Thorpe<br><br>\"<strong><em>This course is an excellent, thorough tutorial on how to begin using Divi. David provides clear and precise instructions on everything you need to get started.\"<br></em></strong><br>- Matthew Koenen<br></p><p><strong><em>\"So far this course is amazing. I just landed a job as a wordpress developer and the company uses Divi for most of its work.\"</em></strong></p><p>- Emmanuel</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"Perfect, everything is explained very clearly\"</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>- </em></strong>Eva Lopatová</p><p><br></p><p><em>\"</em><strong><em>Very useful course. Best one I've seen on web site development in the WP/Divi space</em></strong><em>.\"</em></p><p>- Doug Sire</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"The instructor was knowledgeable and the course exceeded my expectations. I will be able to utilize what I learned in the course and implement Divi Builder in Wordpress. Hopefully, the instructor will offer an intermediate course.\"<br><br></em>- </strong>Sue Hawkins</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Fully Updated in January 2025.</strong></p><p>Gutenberg was launched as an integrated part of WordPress 5.0.&nbsp; Gutenberg was the name given to the new block editor that replaced the Classic WYSIWYG editor that we'd been using since the early versions of WordPress.&nbsp; </p><p>Gutenberg is the editor of choice as you create the content for your WordPress posts and pages.&nbsp; There's blocks for headings, blocks for images, blocks for text. &nbsp;And blocks for just about anything else you'd want to add to a web page.&nbsp; You can build your posts and pages by dragging the blocks onto, and around, the editor.&nbsp; </p><p>But Gutenberg had a huge update with version WordPress 5.9. <strong>&nbsp;Full Site Editing!</strong>&nbsp; This is often abbreviated to FSE and quite often just <strong>Site&nbsp;Editing</strong>, but what does this mean?</p><p>Using the same block editor (Gutenberg) you've been using for your content, you can now edit and design the headers and footers for your website. So you design the bit at the top of the page, the bit at the bottom, and the bit in the middle.&nbsp; That means you now have total control over the design of your website.&nbsp; That is Full&nbsp;Site Editing. You can also create a complete block theme from scratch, and I'll show you how.</p><p>This course is designed to get you up to speed quickly with Full Site Editing in WordPress.&nbsp; </p><p>In this course:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>We take a deep dive into using the Gutenberg editor to create better-looking web pages as well as a complete study on the Full Site Editor itself.</p></li><li><p>The course showcases the Twenty Twenty-Five theme, which is the latest block theme from WordPress.</p></li><li><p>You'll learn how to use the Document Overview and Command Palette to enhance your workflow.</p></li><li><p>You'll learn about the normal, wide, and full-width options you can use in your design, and how to set these values yourself.</p></li><li><p>You'll look at the box model so you fully understand padding and margin, and when to use each of these to add space around your design elements.</p></li><li><p>We'll cover the most common blocks, like paragraph, image, video, button, cover, query loop, columns, table, etc., but also advanced design blocks like Groups, Rows, Stacks, and Grids.</p></li><li><p>You'll explore template hierarchy and how themes consist of templates and template parts.</p></li><li><p>You'll learn to use Global Styles, including typography (where you'll be able to install and use any Google font you want), color palettes, backgrounds, shadows, layout and spacing, and even how to change the default appearance of any block.</p></li><li><p>Following the detailed study of Gutenberg, we'll create a fully functional block theme from scratch, building the template parts and templates required to run a full site. During this process, you'll understand which template you need to create for any post type on your site. We'll even look at using the query loop in a more advanced \"manual\" way, so you can include multiple query loops on a page for more design flexibility.</p></li><li><p>At the end of the course, we'll study all of the other block themes WordPress created, from the Twenty Twenty-Two theme to the Twenty Twenty-Four theme, and how each built on the previous theme, culminating in the latest Twenty Twenty-Five theme that we used and studied during the course.</p></li><li><p>A final section of the course looks at a few \"extras\" that were requested from students of previous versions of the course, like creating a landing page, adding custom CSS to a block theme, and even how to add a sidebar to your theme or just to specific areas of your website.</p></li></ul><p>By the end of the course, you'll have the confidence to take over the design of your own website, using Gutenberg to design the header, footer, and content.&nbsp; You'll be on your way to mastering Full&nbsp;Site Editing.</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Hi and welcome to the <strong>Professional Rails Code Along Course</strong>, where I will walk through how to build a real world Ruby on Rails project that I was hired by a client to develop. My name is Jordan Hudgens, and I'll be your instructor for the course. I've built many different Ruby on Rails applications throughout the past few years for companies such as Eventbrite and Quip and one of my passions is helping individuals learn how to code.</p>\n\n<p>After completing this course you will be able to build a production Rails project from scratch. But there are a million courses that will help you do that. What makes this course different is that you'll learn how to build a Rails application like a professional developer. I took a completely different approach to creating this course. I don't edit any mistakes and I filmed the entire set of videos in real time so you can watch my exact process when I am tasked with building a real world application. I made this decision so that you can get a transparent view into what it takes to become a pro developer, and also so you can see how I work through challenges, all in real time.<br></p>\n\n<p>One of the most critical requirements for a professional Rails developer is a strong knowledge  of testing. With that in mind, every feature that we build in the course will be created with the test driven development process. Some of the key features you'll learn how to implement are:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Using <strong>TDD and BDD</strong> with the RSpec and Capybara testing frameworks</li><li>Working with the Twilio API to <strong>send SMS messages</strong></li><li>Integrating a <strong>permission structure</strong> for users</li><li>Implementing an <strong>administrator dashboard</strong></li><li>Working with <strong>automated email components</strong></li><li>Creating an <strong>approval workflow</strong> from scratch</li><li>Creating JavaScript <strong>Growl</strong> notifications</li><li>And much more!</li></ul>\n\n<p>This course is not for the faint of heart. The ideal student for this project is someone who has already taken a basic Rails course and wants to take their skill to the professional level.<br></p><p>Each lesson comes paired with the source code implemented at that stage so that you can follow along and compare your code with the codebase for the application. And beyond that you can also use the source code to extend it and build your own production applications.</p>\n\n<p>Please feel free to review the course curriculum and I look forward to going through the material with you on your development journey!<br></p>",

We will be using the most popular CSS framework called Bootstrap 4 (we will get in-depth about Bootstrap). We’ll start with <strong>wire-framin</strong><strong>g</strong> our design (I will tell you why this is very important). Then, step by step we will design and code all the sections that the website will be able to offer.\n\n We will spice up the website with creating amazing animations using tricks and techniques that I will teach you. You will be creating animations on hover and animations on scroll that will make your website look like a piece of cake. That’s not all though, we will also create smooth scrolling on our website so it can offer even better user experience for the end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To summarize – We will be using a free wire-framing tool to create our prototypes. HTML and CSS will be used to code and build our website. Bootstrap will help us create a responsive website that will be accessible on smaller screens and mobile devices. Also, we will even use a little bit of JavaScript and jQuery to do some event driven things like animations on scroll or trigger animations.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>\"I was a bit skeptical at first when i bought this, but once I started to dive into the course, i can say that buying this course was one of the best decisions i have made in my short web development career\" - Emilio Pet</em><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n So, why choose me as an instructor? Why buy this course among all those other courses?\n\n It’s because I will offer you a <strong>different </strong>approach to your learning experience. Each lesson you will be presented with a task that you will have to accomplish on your own. Each lesson you will be asked a question that you should answer before moving on. I believe that good teaching is done through student practice and <strong>involvement</strong>. At the end of each section you should take the quiz to check up on your skills and see if you’re ready for the next section.\n\n  At the very end of this course, I will <strong>challenge </strong>you with an ultimate task – create a project as big as the one we were creating throughout the course and show it to me! I will be glad to see it.\n\n \n\n So, why wait? If all this sounds great to you, Press on “<strong>Take this Course</strong>” and start learning today! 100% money-back guarantee!</p>",

Each concept is introduced with clear narration, followed by an immediate hands-on application inside your app. </p><p>--</p><p><strong>What Makes This Course Different?</strong></p><p>You’ll build mini-projects and reusable UI blocks that reflect real-life development needs:</p><ol><li><p>A counter app</p></li><li><p>A greeting form</p></li><li><p>A user list from an API</p></li><li><p>Filterable product cards</p></li><li><p>Show/hide password inputs</p></li><li><p>Tabbed UI interfaces</p></li><li><p>Dark/light mode toggle with localStorage</p></li><li><p>Full feedback form with modal confirmation</p></li></ol><p>And more.</p><p>This is <strong>not</strong> a to-do list app repeated five times. This is React the way it’s meant to be learned — with clean logic, interactivity, styling, and structure. </p><p>--</p><p><strong>Core Concepts You’ll Master</strong></p><p>You’ll go from writing your first JSX snippet to understanding how and when to use useState, useEffect, useRef, and conditional rendering. You’ll learn how to build controlled forms, validate user input in real time, and even manage your app’s look and feel with a dark/light theme toggle. </p><p>You’ll also discover how to <strong>split large components</strong>, <strong>lift state up</strong>, and organize your folders like professional dev teams do — using a modular, scalable structure. </p><p>--</p><p><strong>Tech Stack You’ll Use</strong></p><p>This course uses the latest tools in React frontend development:</p><ul><li><p><strong>React 18+</strong> with functional components and modern hooks</p></li><li><p><strong>Vite</strong> as the build tool for lightning-fast startup and dev refresh</p></li><li><p><strong>Bootstrap 5.3+</strong> for styling UI components</p></li><li><p><strong>ES6+ JavaScript</strong>, including destructuring, arrow functions, and more</p></li></ul><p>No backend, no databases — just frontend logic and a practical development environment you can use for your portfolio or freelance gigs. </p><p>--</p><p><strong>Who This Course Is For</strong></p><p>This course is made for <strong>absolute beginners</strong> and <strong>HTML/CSS/JS learners</strong> who are ready to step into the world of React. It’s also ideal for developers coming from other frameworks like jQuery, Vue, or Angular — and want to see how React builds reusable, composable UIs. </p><p>Bootcamp students, self-learners, and early-career devs will benefit from the hands-on project format. If you’re tired of dry tutorials and want to <em>build things that feel real</em>, this course is for you. </p><p>--</p><p><strong>What You’ll Need</strong></p><p>You don’t need any fancy tools or prior React experience. Just:</p><ul><li><p>A computer with internet access</p></li><li><p>Node.js and a code editor like VS Code (both are free)</p></li><li><p>A modern browser like Chrome or Brave</p></li></ul><p>Everything else will be explained step by step — including how to install Vite and Bootstrap using NPM. </p><p>--</p><p><strong>By the End of This Course…</strong></p><p>You won’t just “know” React — you’ll <strong>use</strong> it. You’ll have built reusable components, structured your code the right way, used all the essential hooks, and crafted a UI that actually responds to users.</p><p>Whether you want to build your own portfolio project, apply for jobs, or freelance, you’ll have the confidence and skill to start building React apps that look and behave like real products.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Content updated in 2022 to reflect latest versions of Ruby, Rails and GraphQL!</p><p>This course teaches the basics of using GraphQL&nbsp;in a Rails application. GraphQL&nbsp;is a query language invented by Facebook in 2012, and made open source in 2015. While it has certain clear advantages over REST, it also&nbsp;has a somewhat steeper learning curve.</p><p>Structured in a simple and&nbsp;accessible manner, these lectures will help you get on your way to using GraphQL to circulate data between back-end and front-end applications.</p><p>In the first section we will learn about reading data. The second section will be focused on changing data, and the slightly more advanced third section is about protecting data, using techniques both implemented in the GraphQL&nbsp;library or suggested by myself.</p><p>GraphQL&nbsp;has a number of features that make it an advantageous change for REST adopters, like the ability to only get what you ask for, or having instant API documentation available after every change. After completing this course, you'll be in a position to implement GraphQL&nbsp;in a new or existing Rails application with basic features all the way up to authorisation and access control. This should definitely get you started on your way!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the Complete React Certification course. This course offers a comprehensive guide into one of the most powerful, modern JavaScript libraries available - ReactJS. Whether you are completely new to React, or you’ve dabbled with it in the past, one thing’s for sure - You’ve likely interacted with a number of web applications that use the React library for building out user interface components. Some of the most well known examples include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI’s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here, the state of the UI component changes on the page without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful UI feature built into React.<br><br>This course starts with exploring the foundations of React and its core use cases. We offer a concise definition of what React is and what it’s not. From there, we explore the tools needed to get started along with an introduction into JSX, and Functional React components. Through a complete hands-on project you will learn a number of important concepts including react props, callbacks, OnClick Events and passing parameters within callback functions. By the end of module one you will have built a fully functional calculator, complete with display and numerical operators. We will also cover important topics such as the React State Hook, and Debugging.<br><br>In the second module students build out a multiplayer Connect-4 clone, with AI integration. Here we start with styling the individual game board components followed by advanced onClickEvents. This includes global, dynamic and inline styling. From there, we move on to passing props, destructing, and React children. Students will explore the React key property, along with Lifecycle events, game initialization, CSS variables, and conditional rendering. By the end, you will have built a complete Connect-4 game capable of automatically determining the winner in both a multi-player and AI based single player setting.<br><br>In module three we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of “context” in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the integrated checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.<br><br>As you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it’s authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim’s core competencies include algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he’s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance. Tim has a genuine passion for teaching others how to become better coders and looks forward to interacting with his students.<br><br>With that said, we hope you’re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit the enroll button and let’s get started.</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the Amazon EC2 Foundations Certification course. This course provides an in-depth overview of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The EC2 service is an essential building block in becoming an AWS certified cloud practitioner. We will start with exploring key concepts relevant to EC2, followed by a hands-on practical guide to deploying compute resources on AWS. <br><br>The term “Scalable Cloud Computing” has now become synonymous with Amazon Web Services. For nearly a decade, AWS has been powering some of the world’s most popular websites and applications. Amazon EC2, is considered the computational backbone of AWS.<br><br>To illustrate how Amazon EC2 works, we explore the concept of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based virtual representation of a server. When we deploy an EC2 “Instance” we’re creating a virtual representation of a physical server and it’s resources.<strong> </strong>This includes: CPU, Memory (RAM), Storage, and network resources such as Bandwidth. <br><br>Similar to physical servers that you might find on-premises,<strong> </strong>virtual EC2 instances can also have different configurations. As a matter of fact, AWS offers the most comprehensive configuration options when it comes to deploying virtual servers.<strong> </strong>These configurations can easily be adapted to our resource needs, in real-time.<br><br>The level of customization a cloud provider can accommodate, will define the sophistication level of it’s overall service. Not all cloud services were created equal. AWS, is known to have the highest level of configuration options when compared to just about any other service. The AWS platform caters to both micro and enterprise level clients, using one of the most scalable and advanced virtualization infrastructures available.<br><br>Beyond the physical hardware customization and scalability, virtualization also accommodates the deployment of any operating system on the virtual machine. As you will see, we have the flexibility of deploying both Linux and Windows servers, using a variety of pre-configured virtual applications known as AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).</p><p>In addition to a theoretical deep dive into Amazon EC2, this course will also provide you with practical hands-on experience in working with the key features of EC2. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>Exploring the characteristics of EC2 Instances.</p></li><li><p>EC2 Instance Types</p></li><li><p>Creating IAM Users for EC2</p></li><li><p>Deploying EC2 Instances with pre-configured AMIs</p></li><li><p>Assigning Elastic IP's to Deployed Instances</p></li><li><p>EC2 Instance Administration </p></li><li><p>Creating Security Groups for Deployed Instances</p></li><li><p>Remote EC2 Administration using SSH Utilities like Terminal for MAC, and PuTTY&nbsp;for Windows.</p></li><li><p>Using EC2 Instance Connect to administer instances. </p></li></ul><p>If you're interested in learning how to deploy and administer virtual machines on the most robust cloud computing platform, hit the enroll button and let's jump right in.</p>",

You will learn to build <strong>SEO</strong> web app using NextJs which is a framework for building production level React apps.</p><p>By the end of this course you will have build a <strong>production ready SEO multi user blogging platform</strong>. This course is your ultimate workshop for building full stack MERN Web Apps with detailed focus on Node React NextJs and SEO.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why we choose React Node NextJs for building SEO Blogging Project</strong></p><ul><li><p>We choose Node React and NextJs because they all <strong>use same programming language</strong> <strong>JavaScript</strong>. So even though it's a FullStack app with separate API and separate frontend, we will be dealing with only one language - JavaScript.</p></li><li><p>We choose Node js and Mongo DB for building API because its incredibly <strong>easy</strong>, <strong>flexible</strong> and <strong>easy to scale.</strong></p></li><li><p>We choose <strong>React</strong> because its extremely <strong>powerful</strong>, <strong>performant</strong> and recently became so much fun and easy to use with the introduction of <strong>hooks.</strong></p></li><li><p>We choose <strong>NextJs</strong> because it takes the <strong>development process</strong> of React apps to whole new level.</p></li><li><p><strong>NextJs</strong> comes with <strong>SSR</strong> out of the box and SSR is necessary for SEO</p></li><li><p>NextJs starting with version 9 automatically decides if your web page can be served as a <strong>static page</strong> or<strong> dynamic page.</strong></p></li><li><p>If your page is not making request to backend server to fetch data then NextJs <strong>automatically serves</strong> that page as <strong>static page</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Static pages <strong>load extremely fast</strong> because they are static. there is no need to wait for server response.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>So you can build your site's homepage or landing page a static page with static content such as pre-written text and images to make it extremely fast.</p><p>I have used NextJs professionally to build a <strong>web app</strong> and it scores <strong>100 out of 100 in google page speed test</strong>. which is hard to believe but true! </p><p><br></p><p><strong>How NextJs makes serving your web pages so fast?</strong></p><ul><li><p>First of all NextJs <strong>analyzes</strong> if the pages can be <strong>served as static or dynamic during its build process</strong>. So if a page can be served as static it will be served as static making it faster than pages that require server response.</p></li><li><p>Second reason is that even though your landing page might have a lot of images, they are served as static content so first the page loads with actual content (text/html) without waiting for images as a result<strong> page is loaded in less than a second</strong>.</p></li><li><p>NextJs from version 9 <strong>prefetch the pages</strong> automatically behind the scene so when the home page is loaded other pages of your site is prefetched behind the scene as long as you are using <strong>next link component</strong>. So when user navigates to different pages... it is lightning fast.</p></li><li><p>With NextJs all your <strong>pages are SEO</strong> so either static or dynamic pages, they are all Search Engine Optimized.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Don't want to learn yet another framework?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Me too :)&nbsp; The best thing about NextJs is that<strong> it's pretty much React</strong>. you still <strong>create components</strong> the way you would usually do with React.</p></li><li><p>There are only few <strong>differences</strong> such as <strong>routing</strong> and a <strong>lifecycle method</strong> (getInitialProps) provided by NextJs which makes <strong>SSR</strong> possible.</p></li><li><p>You will <strong>learn all the good stuff</strong> about NextJs while building this awesome project.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>So if you are looking to <strong>build extremely high performant app</strong> that will <strong>leave all your competitions behind</strong> and <strong>stand out in the crowd</strong>, this course will show you exactly how you can build such app.</p><p><br></p><p><em>This blogging app is </em><strong><em>built for production use</em></strong><em> and is </em><strong><em>flexible</em></strong><em> enough for you to </em><strong><em>use as a one person blogging platform</em></strong><em> or a </em><strong><em>blogging platform for your business</em></strong><em> or use as a </em><strong><em>foundation of a marketplace app</em></strong><em> because it has </em><strong><em>role based multi user blogging system</em></strong><em> in place.</em></p><p><br></p><p>So join me in this course and start coding this awesome app together &lt; /&gt;</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>WebXR </strong>brings both <strong>VR and AR</strong> to the browser. The API has the <strong>massive forces</strong> of <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Amazon</strong> behind it so it looks like immersive experiences, using only a browser, are going to make a <strong>huge impact</strong> in the near future. <strong>WebXR</strong> works great with <strong>Oculus headsets, including the Oculus Quest 2</strong> and the <strong>Chrome Android browser</strong> is already supporting the API for both AR, Augmented Reality, and VR, Virtual Reality, experiences. But WebXR only <strong>harnesses the sensors</strong> on a mobile device and creates an agreed definition of how to use this data. To actually visualise 3D content you need a WebGL library and there is no better one to use than <strong>Three.JS</strong>. This <strong>mature Open&nbsp;Source library</strong> has many users around the globe and is supported by many developers. Three.JS is at version 118 at the time of writing and is a <strong>robust, production ready </strong>library. Recently WebXR support was added to the library. Making it easy for developers to <strong>create immersive experiences</strong>. </p><p>In this course you'll learn how <strong>easy it is</strong>, using <strong>Three.JS</strong>, to create VR and AR experiences. To get the best from the course you will need to be comfortable with <strong>JavaScript coding</strong>. No other <strong>prerequisites</strong> are required. </p><p>The course is split into <strong>10 sections</strong>. </p><ol><li><p><strong>Introduction </strong>- I introduce the history of WebXR, give you a basic primer for those of you new to 3D concepts and show you the Three.JS website and the WebXR examples. </p></li><li><p><strong>A Three.JS Primer</strong> -&nbsp; is for <strong>Three.JS novices</strong> to bring you <strong>up to speed</strong> on the library. </p></li><li><p><strong>An introduction to WebXR using Three.JS</strong> - we look in earnest at your development environment and <strong>create our first WebXR examples</strong>. </p></li><li><p><strong>Using complex assets with Three.JS</strong> - most things you create for immersive experiences will need complex assets and <strong>sourcing, editing, loading and working</strong> with them is the subject of section 4. </p></li><li><p><strong>The WebXR API </strong>- gives a review of the WebXR API. </p></li><li><p><strong>Creating an Architectural Walk-Through</strong> - in section 6 we start to create <strong>real world examples</strong> of immersive content with an architectural walk-through. </p></li><li><p><strong>Placing a Product in a Room</strong> - WebXR lends itself to showing real products in a person’s home and that is the topic for section 7. </p></li><li><p><strong>Using WebXR&nbsp;for games</strong> - VR is perfect for games and we look at the <strong>basic ingredients of a game using WebXR</strong> in this section. </p></li><li><p><strong>Using WebXR for training</strong> - covers the<strong> important topic</strong> of using VR for training. </p></li><li><p><strong>Conclusion</strong> - we look at some WebXR examples to inspire you and review what you’ve learnt. </p></li></ol><p>The only tools you'll need are a <strong>code editor</strong>, in the course I use <strong>Brackets</strong>, freely available online. The course includes <strong>comprehensive resources</strong> and code examples. Each code example comes with two versions, one for you to code along with and another that is complete in case you hit a problem. I show you how to use <strong>GitHub</strong> to <strong>host your development work on a secure server</strong> so you can <strong>easily test your work</strong> on a <strong>headset</strong>, such as an <strong>Oculus Quest</strong></p><p><strong>It’s going to be fun.</strong></p><p>You get a <strong>30 day money back guarantee</strong>, so you're <strong>nothing to lose</strong>, go <strong>virtual today</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Reviews</p><p>\"This is<strong> by far the best guide to Three JS</strong>, nothing but <strong>fun </strong>and clearly explains the parts needed for a 3D app. Thanks Nik for taking the time on this! Can't wait to see where this course take me!\"</p><p>\"Thanks for creating the course\" - <strong>Mr Doob</strong>, the creator of Three.JS</p><p>\"We all <strong>Nik fans </strong>were waiting for this one when he previously announced it in the Facebook group. And <strong>he didn't disappoint us.</strong>\"</p><p>\"Best Intro/History Video Ever\"</p><p>\"<strong>Love it so far!</strong> The lessons are <strong>concise and to the point</strong>. The videos' length seems quite optimized, meaning they are not terribly long yet are filled with <strong>just enough information</strong> about what's going on. The supplied course project files constitute a valuable facilitation on the way through the course.\"</p><p>\"It starts with the basics and then <strong>progress to advanced topics</strong>. I like the pace and the explanations. <strong>Great course</strong>!\"</p><p>\"Great course, love the well-chosen examples, <strong>just what I needed!</strong>\"</p><p>\"Excellent course, it took me by surprise how well documented and the <strong>high quality content</strong> from Nicholas , <strong>highly recommended</strong>. Cheers!\"</p><p>\"I haven't heared before so <strong>simple</strong> yet pleasant narration of threejs app development now I realize how <strong>talented</strong> the author is.\"</p>",

  "description": "<h5>A Verifiable Certificate of Completion is presented to all students who undertake this course.</h5>  <p>This Dynamic Web Design with PHP and MySQL training course will give you a working understanding of these important technologies and show you how to use them to create your own impressive websites. When used in combination, there simply isn&#039;t a better way to construct sites that involve complexity, large volumes of data, and the flexibility to make adjustments and changes over time.

Listen to our students:  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>Around two months ago I graduated from the University of Applied Sciences in Rotterdam as a User Experience Designer. Pretty awesome but soon I discovered there was not a lot of work in this area of expertise. So to enhance my chances for a suitable job I decided to improve my front-end skills. Every company wants people with programming skills nowadays. Since I advertised that in my motivational letters and mentioning it in my CV I have multiple invitation from companies to get to know each other.\"</em> -- Ruud Visser, Graduate from University of Applied Sciences in Rotterdam  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Coders that want to learn HTML and CSS fast</p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>Excellent course that exposed me step-by-step to the world of web design.

I have done other training before but they don't ever seem to close it off at the end. This class went over everything needed to make a site. I would love to find other courses like this. I also did not feel dumb mid way through the course due to lack of explaining. Everything was well documented and covered. Very good job on this thanks.</em> - Jay Mims  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Hustlers who want promotions</p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>Man, I would have to say this is hands down the best course ever!

Maybe your CSS performs poorly, or, maybe your just spending too much time digging through CSS code to solve minor display issues.</p>\n\n<p>Stop wasting time tearing your hair out over confusing or poor performing CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>With <strong>Learn SASS and SCSS with Dave Moran</strong>, you'll be introduced to the technologies of SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) and SCSS (Sassy CSS).  If you're not familiar with these important advances in the CSS world, SASS is a CSS pre-processor with syntax advancements. Style sheets in the advanced syntax are processed, and turned into regular CSS style sheets. SCSS is a super set of CSS, expanded to accommodate the features of SASS. SASS can be used with any version of CSS and all CSS libraries are compatible.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course you'll do more than watch demonstrations from an expert instructor.  Dave will invite you to code along as you go from SASS newbie to expert. You'll complete this course ready to integrate SASS workflow and SCSS syntax in to your own development projects. To insure that you retain the information presented, Dave has prepared several code exercises to help you get the hang of things.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>With over 1,000,000 enrollments world wide LearnToProgram brings you instructors who are teachers first-- Our instructors are able to take complex technical information and make it understandable for just about anyone.  Dave Moran is no exception and you will find his teaching style to be both comfortable and immediately understandable as you learn SASS and SCSS.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to  <strong>Learn SASS and SCSS with Dave Moran</strong>.

  "description": "<p>Hello,</p><p>Welcome to the \"<strong>Typescript &amp; React JS Course with React &amp; Typescript Project</strong>\" course. </p><p><strong>Typescript and ReactJS course helps you understand React JS &amp; Type script in detail with real Typescript React Projects</strong></p><p><strong>TypeScript</strong> is a programming language developed and maintained by <strong>Microsoft</strong>. It introduces additional features like strict type binding (variables are bound to specific data types) to <strong>JavaScript</strong> and can also be compiled down to <strong>Java Script</strong> as well. TypeScript, Typescript, Type script, typescript react, react typescript, react js, hooks and context</p><p>TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.</p><p>TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a <strong>tighter integration with your editor</strong>. Catch errors early in your editor.</p><p>TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which <strong>runs anywhere JavaScript runs</strong>. TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses <strong>type inference to give you great tooling</strong> without additional code.</p><p>TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.</p><p>TypeScript is <strong>a superset of typed JavaScript (optional) that can help build and manage large-scale JavaScript projects</strong>. It can be considered JavaScript with additional features like strong static typing, compilation, and object-oriented programming.</p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p>React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.</p><p>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.</p><p><br></p><p>This React training can help you become skilled in using this powerful JavaScript tool. With this React course, you can learn how to create elements that let users update data in real time, create useful interactive components on a webpage, and so much more. Millions have learned to use React with JavaScript with Oak Academy, and you can too.</p><p><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></p><p><strong>What is Typescript?</strong><br><strong>TypeScript </strong>is a programming language that helps developers turn medium-sized <strong>JavaScript projects</strong> and prototypes into large-scale ones. JavaScript, a widely-used programming language, was designed to be easy to use for developers and non-developers alike. As a result, JavaScript development is difficult to scale up. Microsoft introduced <strong>typescript react</strong> to solve this scalability problem. <strong>TypeScript </strong>is often referred to as JavaScript with <strong>typescript react</strong> because it allows developers to find errors while writing their code rather than wait until the application is running. And because <strong>TypeScript&nbsp; </strong>is a syntactical superset of JavaScript, any JavaScript program is also a valid <strong>TypeScript </strong>program.<br><br><strong>What is the difference Typescript and Javascript?</strong><br><strong>Typescript </strong>is a superset of <strong>JavaScript</strong>. As its name suggests, <strong>Type script </strong>adds optional static typing to the JavaScript language. JavaScript is a scripting language that allows developers to create dynamic web content. It is known for being fairly easy to use and learn. This makes it a popular programming language for small and medium-scale web projects. Developers use <strong>Type script </strong>when they need to scale up their JavaScript development. Its language is more powerful and intuitive, allowing developers to find and correct errors during compile time, rather than only during run-time, as with JavaScript. <strong>TypeScript </strong>is better suited than JavaScript for large applications, but it requires a foundational knowledge of JavaScript to use.<br><br><strong>What careers use Typescript?</strong><br><strong>TypeScript </strong>is mainly associated with development careers. Typical job titles for <strong>TypeScript </strong>developers include senior developer, front end developer, stack developer, and software engineer. Because <strong>react typescript</strong> and <strong>typescript node</strong> is a superset of JavaScript, learning <strong>react typescript</strong> is a great next step for engineers who are already skilled in JavaScript. Programming knowledge is applicable in just about every industry, so developers with an understanding of TypeScript (which implies skill in JavaScript) might work in a wide range of fields building applications for both server-side and client-side execution.<br><br><strong>What is TypeScript and why use it?</strong></p><p>TypeScript features, syntax, and keywords in <strong>nodejs typescript</strong></p><p>Tooling and Framework Options</p><p>How to create a class</p><p>TypeScript variables and functions in<strong> angular typescript</strong></p><p>TypeScript declarations</p><p>TypeScript classes and interfaces</p><p>Much more...</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React.JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><strong>This course is going to take you from the beginning to a further level.

I've seen it all...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But you can stop worrying...right here and now!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>I understand the difference between a passing fad, and what's here to stay.</em><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And do you want to know what's here to stay?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>...Sass!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Sass is what's known as a \"pre-processor\" language, and it basically supercharges your CSS so you can create flexible, clean and incredibly powerful stylesheets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The entire purpose of Sass is to save you time &amp; energy when styling websites and applications.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why is this a good thing?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I've done some experiments and I've discovered that you can style websites 150% faster using Sass vs. CSS...<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For example, let's say a custom web design project takes 50 hours to style in CSS (not unusual!)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In Sass, it would only take you 33 hours to style!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>That's 17 hours of saved time per project...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, if you take on 3 web design projects per month, you'll save 51 hours each month...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>That's the equivalent of...</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>63+ episodes of Downton Abbey</li><li>Taking an entire week off work</li><li>Booking a paid gig at $50/hour = that's an extra $2.5k</li><li>Walking around Central Park 25 times</li><li>Roadtrip from Los Angeles to New York</li><li>Taking on a part-time job at your favourite coffee shop</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The question is, what would YOU do with a 150% increase in web design productivity?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Join <em>The Sass Course</em> today and let's get started!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>...Not convinced?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I've taught more than 180,000 students on Udemy...</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>...and over 26,000 on YouTube!</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I am one of the most reviewed, top-rated coding instructors on Udemy...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I create some of the most popular &amp; engaging web design courses on the web today...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>My courses are known to deliver tremendous results, and keep students coming back for more (and more)!</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>...and this course is no exception!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There are endless courses and instructors out there (even right here on Udemy) claiming to teach you the skills you want to learn, but many of them fail to deliver quality material...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>They waste your time...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>They mumble into the mic...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You barely learn anything...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>...and some of them are so boring that you fall asleep (been there, done that)!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Sass Course is a highly engaging coding course, jam-packed with value and hands-on lessons, and sprinkled with entertainment and humour!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>From beginning to end, you'll be learning by DOING...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Every single minute is valuable, and I guarantee you'll see results from this course!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Don't believe me?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Take the entire course...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>...and if you don't see value, experience results, feel it's not worth your time or money, or fall asleep even once...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You're protected with a 100% money-back guarantee! </strong>Simply request a refund within the first 30-days, and you'll get your investment back, no questions asked.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So, how about it?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are you ready to STOP feeling frustrated, and START taking control of the skills you want to learn to succeed as a web designer today?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Let's get started!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>See you on the other side :)</p>",

We take a bottom-up approach and first study all the elements (actors, endpoints, and tokens) of OpenID Connect. This puts us in an excellent position for the second step: to understand the various OpenID Connect Flows - how the actors, endpoints, and tokens are put together to transmit identity claims securely.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Do you wonder why there are several OpenID Connect Flows?</strong></p><p>Whether we use OpenID Connect from a mobile app, a script in a browser or from a secure backend server, there is an appropriate OpenID Connect Flow with the right tradeoffs in security, functionality, and convenience for each of these scenarios. This course helps you to choose the right one.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Do you think that these OpenID Connect Flows are confusing?</strong></p><p>You are not alone; the OpenID Connect Flows tend to get confusing. However, with this course, we make it clear and easy to understand: We visualize these flows and show how to choose the flow that is appropriate for a given scenario. <em>A picture says more than a 1000 words</em> - that is why we explain the OpenID Connect Flows using easy to understand sequence diagrams.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Do you want to understand how JWT works?</strong></p><p>This course explains what a JSON Web Token (JWT) is, how it is used in OpenID Connect, how it is constructed, what data it contains, how to read it, and how to protect its contents.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Do you wonder why there are so many tokens in OpenID Connect and how to use them?</strong></p><p>There are JWT, JWS, JWE, access tokens, refresh tokens, identity tokens, and authorization codes. This book helps you to make sense of them all. Using examples, we explore how the tokens are used, constructed, signed, and encrypted.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why is OpenID Connect so popular?</strong></p><p>If used in the right way, OpenID Connect is powerful, and everyone loves it:</p><ul><li><p><strong>End-users</strong> don't need to signup and remember a new password</p></li><li><p><strong>Business owners</strong> enjoy high conversion rates</p></li><li><p><strong>Developers</strong> don't get any grey hair over securely storing credentials.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Do you want to increase the conversion rate of your app?</strong></p><p>Signup and login to a new app become so smooth and convenient that end-users are much more likely to try a new app. It is supported, e.g. by Google, Yahoo, or Microsoft.</p><p><br></p><p><br><strong>This course is for you...</strong><br></p><p>...if you want to improve your market value as a Software Engineer and Security Expert. Imagine what could happen to your professional career if you could add OpenID Connect, API Security and OAuth skills to your CV!</p><p>API Security experts and engineers who understand OpenID Connect are in HIGH DEMAND, as companies expand their digital business. Plenty of opportunities are waiting for anyone who has the right skills.</p><p><strong>Do you want to write best-selling iPhone and Android apps?</strong></p><p>The most popular mobile apps integrate with popular social APIs of Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, Paypal and many more. If this is a well-known fact, why do app developers not just do it?</p><p>Many app developers are afraid of complicated OpenID Connect integrations. Identity, Login, and Signup are in fact the biggest hurdle for most mobile app developers.</p><p>With the knowledge gained in this course, you can use the secret of best app developers out there and finally integrate your app with social APIs.</p><p><strong>Do you want to start out on your own, as an entrepreneur, consultant or freelancer?</strong></p><p>Knowing API Security, OAuth, and OpenID Connect allows you to realize the big vision of your company in the field of mobile apps, cloud apps and web APIs, such as Google, Paypal, and LinkedIn.</p><p><strong>Do you want to build exciting solutions with next-generation technology?</strong></p><p>Whether you are a web developer, mobile developer or API developer, an architect or embedded developer for the Internet of Things, today you need to know OpenID Connect to build state of the art solutions.</p><p><strong>What does this course offer?</strong></p><p>This course offers an introduction to API Security with OpenID Connect. In 7 hours you will gain an overview of the capabilities of OpenID Connect and OAuth. You will learn the core concepts of OpenID Connect. You will get to know all 3 OpenID Connect flows that are used in cloud solutions and mobile apps.</p><p>This course explains OpenID Connect in simple terms. The three OpenID Connect flows are visualized graphically using sequence diagrams. The diagrams are then animated so you get to know the interactions step by step and see the big picture of the various OpenID Connect interactions. This high-level overview is complemented with a rich set of example requests and responses and an explanation of the technical details.</p><p><strong>Who should take this course?</strong></p><p>Do you believe OpenID Connect is complicated? OpenID Connect may seem complex with flows and redirects going back and forth. This course will give you clarity by introducing the seemingly complicated material by many illustrations. These illustrations clearly show all the involved interaction parties and the messages they exchange.</p><p>Do you want to learn the OpenID Connect concepts efficiently? This course uses many animated diagrams and sequence diagrams. A good diagram says more than 1000 words.</p><p>Do you want to use OpenID Connect in your mobile app? If you want to access resources that are protected by OAuth, you need to get a token first, before you can access the resource. For this, you need to understand the OAuth flows and the dependencies between the steps of the flows.</p>",
