Simply put, insecure sites being served over HTTP will rank worse than secure sites being served over HTTPS.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Chrome, FireFox and other browser vendors are adding more and more visual cues that make even non-technical folks aware that your site is dangerous to view.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It won't take long until all insecure sites are seen as being malicious and untrustworthy, even if you're technically not doing anything wrong. Although honestly, I would classify not securing your site as doing your visitors a disservice.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Insecure sites allow anyone to intercept and read the traffic between your visitors and your site.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>That's because insecure sites transmit all data over plain text. This makes your visitor's data sensitive to man in the middle attacks, which in turn could be a disaster for both your audience and yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, most people using your site aren't tech savvy, and don't understand that by logging into an insecure site they are leaking sensitive data. If their account gets compromised, guess who they're gong to blame? Yep, your site.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>The good news is, securing your site over HTTPS (with SSL certificates) fixes all of the above problems.</em><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Search engines will recognize that you care about security and they will rank you higher in organic search results.</li><li>Browser vendors will give you a secure green lock icon next to your domain name in the URL bar (just like this site). That's way better than a scary not secure label!</li><li>Your visitor's browsing activity and data will be encrypted. That means anything your visitors send or receive through your site will be protected from anyone trying to read it. In other words, it's secure.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br>Let's Encrypt Is the Best Thing Ever for HTTPS</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>1. <em>Let's Encrypt is its own certificate authority</em>, meaning it has been white listed by major browsers to offer trusted SSL certificates. <em>Most other SSL certificate vendors are just re-sellers</em> who leech off other certificate authorities because it's very difficult to become a trusted certificate authority.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>2. <em>Let's Encrypt allows you to issue SSL certificates for free</em>. You can issue certificates for let's say: <em>example[dot]com</em>, <em>blog.example[dot]com</em> and <em>admin.example[dot]com</em> for free. <em>Other vendors would charge you $30+ / year</em> because you would need 3 separate certs (sub-domains need their own cert).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>3. Let's Encrypt allows you to <em>automate verifying and renewing your SSL certificates</em> and doesn't require setting up any billing details. Other SSL vendors require you to <em>manually renew each individual certificate on a yearly basis</em>, and also keep your billing information up to date.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>4. <em>Let's Encrypt open sourced all of their tools</em> and has a vibrant community built around it. <em>Other SSL vendors keep everything behind closed doors</em> and force you to use their difficult to use website because it's beneficial to them (example: they charge you certificate revoke fees if you mess up).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>5. In 1 year, <em>Let's Encrypt went from having 4+ million active SSL certificates to 40+ million active certs</em> and their growth is exploding. <em>Other SSL vendors are simply not issuing as many certs </em>because people are beginning to realize they don't need to get price gouged to secure their site.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What will I be able to do after completing this course?</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You'll be able to secure your site with HTTPS using Let's Encrypt.

It's a huge win (and secure).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>nginx and Apache are the most popular web servers in the world and they can each do a number of things very well, but here's what you'll learn to do in this course (with both):\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>1. Host static websites with no back-end. An example of this could be sites generated with Jekyll, or any other static site generator. It's just HTML files with CSS and Javascript.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>2. Forward traffic to any popular web framework such as Rails, Express, Flask, Django, WordPress and so on. This is labeled as a \"reverse proxy\" and it's how you link a web app to nginx or Apache.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>You'll even learn how to host more than 1 site or web app on a single server using virtual hosts.</em><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But is this course worth it?</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of spending hundreds of hours furiously Googling around on your own while you second guess every decision, you can sit back and relax while someone who has been in the trenches for 2 decades provides you working solutions. It's like getting instant access to a private consultant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There's also all of the money you'll save by not having to buy and renew SSL certificates every year, but more importantly you're getting a fully automated solution so you don't have to worry about your site breaking out of the blue because you accidentally forgot to renew an SSL certificate.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What makes this course special?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I've been using Let's Encrypt since it first went live. This course has battle hardened configs and scripts that I have been using and tweaking over the years while I've worked as a self taught full stack developer.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You're not just getting theory and lessons. You're getting production ready solutions that you can apply to your projects.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I've also been a teacher for a number of years and well over 20,000+ people have taken one of my courses.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What kind of support can I expect?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The very best.

  "description": "<p><strong>SSL/TLS is often implemented without being fully understood!</strong></p><p>If you've worked in an IT environment of any size and for any period, you've used SSL/TLS at least once. Think of that self-signed certificate you’ve created for the company's internal portal or when the information security department required you to switch to HTTPS for all web communications.</p><p>90% of the time, you follow the steps to implement SSL/TLS, but you don't really get the why and the how. Remember when the information security professional required you to use TLS 1.2 and not 1.1? what’s the difference? Are we using SSL or TLS or both? Why does the browser sometimes show a warning message when you switch to HTTPS although you followed every step in the guide? What is mTLS?</p><p>Do you have time to read books and articles about all that jargon? Probably not.</p><p><strong>This class is here to help you!</strong></p><p><strong>SSL/TLS theory and implementation</strong> was designed for those of us who need to get up to speed with SSL/TLS as soon as possible. But they don’t have time to go through all the books, articles, guides, and manuals.</p><p>The class was created with junior developers, operators, and QA engineers in mind. It is a beginner’s course. So, if you are a seasoned security professional with many years of IT security experience and you’re looking to take your knowledge to the next level, this course is not for you.</p><p><strong>SSL/TLS is the kind of knowledge that will make you stand out of the crowd!</strong></p><p>IT professionals with more than one skill set are <strong>more likely to get hired/promoted</strong>. That’s a fact. Your time is precious, and you need to <strong>widen your skillset as fast as possible</strong>. That’s another fact.</p><p><strong>How to maximize your benefit from this class?</strong></p><p>Some people like to read the theory first, grasp the concept, and build a mental model. Further on, they start implementing what they’ve learned.</p><p>Some other people prefer to get their hands dirty as soon as they can. If they are stuck with something, they refer to the theory and explanation.</p><p>If you’re of the first kind, you can go through the course from start to finish. Sections one and two draw the big picture and lay the ground for what’s next. The rest of the class includes many hands-on exercises for the most common use cases of SSL/TLS.</p><p>Those of you who are less patient can start directly at section three, which is the first section in the “implementation” part of the class.</p><p><strong>What is covered?</strong></p><p>· What is SSL/TLS and the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)?</p><p>· What is an X.509 certificate and how does it fit in the equation?</p><p>· How and when to use wildcard certificates?</p><p>· What is a CA, an intermediary CA, and a leaf/node certificate?</p><p>· How to create a self-signed certificate in just one command?</p><p>· How to deploy certificates on Nginx, Apache web server, and Apache Tomcat application server?</p><p>· How to create your very own certificate authority (CA)?</p><p>· How to create an intermediary CA for enhanced security?</p><p>· How to use free services like Let’s Encrypt to install certificates to your websites?</p><p>· What and how to use mutual TLS (mTLS) for client authentication?</p><p>· How to use SSL/TLS with Kubernetes Ingress Nginx controller?</p><p>· How to use free certificates from Amazon using AWS certificate manager?</p><p>In addition to several quizzes to test your knowledge.</p><p><strong>A note about Extra Lectures</strong></p><p>This class includes more than one lecture which is labeled “extra lectures”. The purpose of them is to provide even more value for the student. However, they may require some additional background that not everyone has. So, they are not strictly required to understand the core concept of the class, but they provide some extra value. For example, using SSL/TLS certificates with Kubernetes Ingress controller requires an understanding of Kubernetes clusters and how they work.</p><p>Again, <strong>SSL/TLS is more implemented than understood</strong>.</p><p>Enrich your knowledge, become an expert in multiple domains, and jumpstart your professional IT career.</p><p>The course offers a <strong>30-days money-back guarantee, no questions asked</strong>.</p><p>Go ahead and <strong>enroll now!</strong></p>",

And HTML and CSS is the entry point to this world!</p><p>If you are interested in front-end development, look no further. This course is the complete beginners that is fully mobile responsive.</p><p><strong>The advantage of this course is that it’s completely project-based</strong> and I use my avatar to clearly describe everything. It makes the lesson absolutely understandable.</p><p>This lecture divides to three sections. We start by exploring HTML5, students learn the composition of a web page and how a web browser interprets html code to display the visual elements of a page. </p><p><strong>The HTML&nbsp;sections covers the following key concepts:</strong></p><ul><li><p>HTML Structure</p></li><li><p>An overview of HTML5</p></li><li><p>Using division tag</p></li><li><p>Creating Ordered &amp;&nbsp;Unordered Lists</p></li><li><p>Inserting Images </p></li><li><p>Creating Links Tags</p></li><li><p>Inserting section</p></li><li><p>Using attributes</p></li><li><p>+ Much More</p></li></ul><p>Here, students will learn to add stunning design elements to really make web pages visually aesthetic. We will also cover CSS attributes and properties for adding style to web documents and make the web pages completely mobile responsive.</p><p><strong>The CSS&nbsp;section of this course covers the following key concepts:</strong></p><ul><li><p>CSS&nbsp;Rules</p></li><li><p>CSS class</p></li><li><p>Divisions</p></li><li><p>CSS&nbsp;id</p></li><li><p>The Box model</p></li><li><p>Font Properties</p></li><li><p>Backgrounds </p></li><li><p>Positioning</p></li><li><p>Link Styling</p></li><li><p>CSS animation</p></li><li><p>Display flex</p></li><li><p>Transition</p></li><li><p>+ Much More</p></li></ul><p>In the last section of this course students will dive into adding interactive client-side functionality using JavaScript. JavaScript is an extremely powerful front-end programming language that can really help take web pages to another level. This section teaches students how to animate images and objects, and manipulate both HTML&nbsp;and CSS&nbsp;elements using the DOM&nbsp;(Document Object Model).</p><p><strong>The JavaScript section covers the following key concepts:</strong></p><ul><li><p>JavaScript output</p></li><li><p>Variable declarations</p></li><li><p>Objects</p></li><li><p>Strings</p></li><li><p>Methods </p></li><li><p>Conditional statements</p></li><li><p>Functions and events</p></li><li><p>jQuery library</p></li><li><p>+&nbsp;Much More</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p>We’ll take the time to&nbsp;<strong>explain every content</strong>&nbsp;that my avatar and I teach, so that you actually learn details.

enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned developers' expertise Questions sent by students to our instructors are answered by our instructors within <strong>48 hours at the latest</strong></p><p><strong><em>Fresh Content</em></strong></p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate New tools are released every day, and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge for being a better React developer You will always have up-to-date content for this course at <strong>no extra charge</strong></p><p><strong>What is Web development?</strong></p><p>Web development is a broad description of the tasks and technologies that go into creating a website It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) Frontend code executes on the user's computer This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a front-end web developer HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer The good news is that web development generally uses lightweight code that is easier to learn than many other languages If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months But good web developers never stop learning A better question might be, \"What can I do to become a better web developer faster?\" The answer to this question is practice Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM) These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML React Native uses React to build mobile applications Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application With this in mind, React is a library It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built</p><p><strong>What is React Native?</strong></p><p>Created by Facebook, React Native is an open-source-based mobile application framework that uses only JavaScript, making it capable of supporting both Android and iOS platforms React, also known as React js, saves time and effort for developers since they only need one programming language The Native element allows developers to create JavaScript components to design software programs that run on various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, smart TVs, and laptops With React Native, developers use the same concepts used in the original React framework to design a rich mobile user interface (UI) for various environments from existing components</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning There are a couple of reasons The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job This alone is another reason it is worth learning Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different In React, web components are generated In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs If your focus is web development, then you should learn React If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular One reason is that Facebook developed it The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs) React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements</p><p><strong>What is Node Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time By using JavaScript, node Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux) Node js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast Examples of applications that use node Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node Js?</strong></p><p>Node Js is open-source, meaning it’s free code for all developers On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node Js environment continues to be enhanced Because Node Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training Node Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run) Node Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required Because Node Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies</p><p><strong>What is microservices architecture and how can Node Js be used for it?</strong></p><p>Microservices architecture is a software development style or method where single-function modules originate Each has a very well-defined operation and interface and can deploy on its own In essence, it’s a way of developing modules that you can repurpose from one program or application to another When you create an application, it’s a collection of modules that have been thoroughly tested and are well-maintained The modules are typically built around different business-specific capabilities and are then loosely coupled to other modules when deployed as part of a program You can use Node Js in microservices architecture as the language of choice for one, some, or all of the microservices (or modules) The beauty of microservices is that you can use the best language for the specific microservice But where highly scalable, fast programs are needed, Node Js would be a top contender</p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our content is created/produced as <strong>high-quality video/audio</strong> to provide you with the best learning

In this course, you will learn how to build a complete <strong>Coffee Shop System</strong> from the ground up in a few hours. I already made sure that every part of this course is concise, elegant, and informative, so don't miss out on this cool opportunity. I also included the files needed in different parts of the course for you to follow along with me step by step.</p><p><br><br>Here is what you are going to learn, first of all, I am going to introduce you to the tools that we are going to be using in this course. And then we are going to build a full authentication system from scratch. While building this system I am going to introduce you to hashing and dehashing passwords. Right after this, we will allow users to book tables and I will add lots of validation points in this area of the course to assure the quality of this function. And then, we are going to build general and cool features inside our own app. It's going to be mainly on selecting and placing data. After this part, We are going to build a cart system where we will allow users to add drinks to the cart so they can order them online. And then naturally to the checkout page and after this, I am going to show you how to pay with PayPal easily and nicely. Since this part is done we will only have some general parts on the user end like grabbing bookings and orders for every user, allowing users to write reviews, and so on. Also, there is a part where we will work with the menu to display more products to the users. And then to the admin panel which is going to be really simple yet very functional and you are going to learn a lot building it. So, to sum up, if that sounds like something interesting to you, go ahead and get the course now.</p>",

  "description": "<p>RESTful APIs are part of our everyday life and most may not even know it. Because most of the design and implementation of these APIs is left up to developers and architects, there are a wide array of opinions and ideas on how things should work. This can create a good deal of confusion. </p>\n\n<p>Writing Beautiful RESTful APIs provides a fundamental overview of REST, best practices for design, and discusses several advanced topics like pagination, search, and authentication. </p>\n\n<p>This course is meant for beginners to API design, but it is also a good refresher for those who are familiar to API design or are hoping to gain a deeper understanding of advanced topics. </p>\n\n<p>By the end of the course, you will understand the fundamentals of REST and you'll be able to start designing your APIs to be \"beautiful APIs\".</p>",

I've always been a big advocate of spreading the basics to as many people as possible, as I believe knowledge and personal growth are some of the best ways to better our world as a whole. Enjoy.</strong></p><p>Welcome to the Modern Three.js for Real Websites course, where you will learn how to develop a premium quality, 3D portfolio site that'll put you leagues ahead of your competition.</p><p>My name is Christopher Lis, and I'm an award winning Full-Stack Engineer with over ten years of web development experience.

If you are a beginner you can enroll in this course as this course starts on with the very basic concepts of Flask website development and slowly move towards the very advanced topics of flask website development. A crash course has also been uploaded at the end of this course so that those students who have no knowledge of python which is a pre requisite to this course can go and learn the basics of python from that crash course. So everything is right here in this course. You do not have to go any where. I hope you will enjoy this course and learn a lot from it and I assure you that at the end of this course you will be on your way to create websites using flask. If you have any queries during the course you are more than welcome to ask and I will be more than happy to answer your questions.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course is all about creating a fully functioning production ready, real time web application! We will learn how to bring together many different libraries and techniques from the JavaScript ecosystem together into a cohesive product that is ready for deployment!</p>\n\n<p>Many courses focus on individual components and small example applications; while this one instead focuses on how everything can work together. If you want to see the development of a completed project working seamlessly with socket.io, nodejs, Reactive Extensions, WebPack (and more!), then this is the course for you!<br>We not only have a focus on our build pipeline - both development and production - but also on creating an architecture that takes advantage of the reactive programming paradigm.</p>\n\n<p>It's impossible to classify this course as a tour of any particular component, since, as you know, real applications are much more complicated than that. But rest assured that we leave no stone unturned as we explore how each component can work seamlessly together.</p>\n\n<p>So if you want to take your JavaScript skills to the next level, if you want to be up to date on the latest development techniques, then this course is a must!</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course is a complete view into building production ready applications using React and Reactive Extensions!</p>\n\n<p>React is a view library created by Facebook that has taken the JavaScript community by storm over the last few years. It's largely responsible for a paradigm shift in web development, emphasizing the creation of reusable, modular components that are easy to understand and manipulate. Used properly, React can eliminate most, if not all, of the error-prone, long-winded, DOM manipulation code you may have had to write in the past!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Reactive Extensions (RXJS) is a library that allows us to write reactive code in JavaScript. As you'll see in this course, RXJS and React go hand in hand to provide a complete, modern, easy to understand architecture for our applications. While we use RXJS in lieu of Redux or Flux, inspiration from both are heavily borrowed; so you will leave this course with a leg up in understanding the core principles of those patterns as well!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This series is a project-based look at using all of the technologies that are becoming commonplace in the web development world. We use Gulp, WebPack, Babel, SASS, and Jasmine to put together a real-world asset pipeline that will support the development and deployment of our application.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course has four main sections:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>React Primer</strong><strong>:</strong> we start with an introduction to React terminology and syntax by putting together a few simple applications.</li><li><strong>Asset Pipeline: </strong>next, we begin our main project in this course by wiring together Gulp, WebPack, Babel and SASS in order to create an asset pipeline that is necessary to support a React application.</li><li><strong>Project Client</strong><strong>: </strong>the \"meat\" of this course; in this section we build all of our client-side code, and use RXJS and React to establish the architecture that will support our project.</li><li><strong>Project Server:</strong> the final main section will focus on the creation of a socket-io server that will provide all of the server-side logic of our application.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, at the end of this course, we will <strong>deploy </strong>our application to a <strong>free</strong> Heroku hosting account!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of this course is simple: to be a start to finish, end to end, complete look at how we can architect an application properly using modern patterns and techniques while taking advantage of the React library!</p>",

The simplest definition of <strong>React </strong>is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong>. These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in <strong>React </strong>can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p><strong>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library.</strong> Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of <strong>React</strong>, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p><strong>React </strong>encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><strong>What is Node.Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications. It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time. By using JavaScript, node.Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript. Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux). Node.js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast. Examples of applications that use node.Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node.Js?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is open-source, meaning it’s free code for all developers. On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node.Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base. Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node.Js environment continues to be enhanced. Because Node.Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment. It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training. Node.Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node.Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs. It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run). Node.Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required. Because Node.Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs. The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time. It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies.</p><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching. </p><p><strong>OAK Academy</strong> based in <strong>London</strong> is an online <strong>education company</strong>.

  "description": "<p>We will journey through <strong>JavaScript</strong> by learning only concepts you'll see most often on the job. This allows you to cut right to the meat of programming and enable you to become job-ready faster. No more learning outdated concepts for the sake of learning them. We'll practice with the latest syntax and use best practices all the way through. I take a practical approach by teaching you the tools you'll need to build apps and websites effectively. We will start off by learning basic HTML &amp; CSS. Then we'll jump into the JavaScript fundamentals to give you a solid foundation. Quizzes will be provided after every video to be sure you don't miss a beat. Before we jump into the projects section we'll go into the <strong>Tools</strong> section where I give you the <strong>JavaScript</strong> tools you'll need to create any app that comes your way. We'll end off by diving into 15+ projects designed to drill in all concepts learned throughout the course. I hope you're ready to finally get this programming language under your belt because you'll leave this course with a wealth of knowledge of <strong>JavaScript</strong> and 15+ projects to prove you are ready to put your skills to use in the real world. I'll see you in the course.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you as fired up as I am? Do you want to build something awesome? Something amazing? Are you a web developer who wants a cool job? If so, then this course is for you. In this course, you will learn how to build a complete hotel booking system from the ground up in a few hours. I already made sure that every part of this course is concise, elegant, and informative, so don't miss out on this cool opportunity. I also included the files needed in different parts of the course for you to follow along with me step by step.</p><p><br><br>Here is what you are going to learn, first of all, I am going to introduce you to the tools that we are going to be using in this course. And then we are going to build a full authentication system from scratch. While building this system I am going to introduce you to hashing and dehashing passwords. And then, we are going to build general and cool features inside our own app. It's going to be mainly on selecting and placing data. After this part, we are going to move to the next crucial part of our app and that's the booking part which is going to be challenging but I am going to guide you through it. it's mainly validations and inserting data. and then we are going to move to pay with PayPal which is also kind of problematic but I am going to help you. The next move is taking care of general things about our website like fixing bugs, grabbing bookings for every user, adding a 404 page, validating, and so on. We are going to move on to the second part of our app and which is the admin panel. And it's going to be huge. We will take care of a lot of things. We will manage bookings, admins, hotels, rooms and so much more. Of course, this is not all. There is a lot to talk about but this is just a simple description of our system. So if you like this, Get the course now. I will see you inside </p>",

EVERYTHING in the same Laravel project.</p><p><strong>Receive recurring payments (subscriptions)<br></strong>Don't stop there.

During the course, you will see the enormous facilities that Laravel offers when implementing complex tasks. Of course, we are using the latest version of Laravel.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why PayPal and Stripe?<br></strong>It's not just about PayPal and Stripe. In the course, everything will be perfectly adaptable to any additional platform that is added in the future or those you need to use.</p><p>Initially, PayPal and Stripe are used with Laravel because both, PayPal and Stripe, are the most popular online payment gateways globally and meet a huge portion of online businesses' needs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What about SCA?<br></strong>Do not worry! I cover you on this too. SCA (Strong Customer Authentication) is a very important security requirement for some regions and it is a good idea to take that into consideration for your projects.

Especially when several are required at once.</p><p>You will want to complete this course since the first class.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is this course for you?<br></strong>This course is probably for anyone (expert or not). This course is for you if you meet any of these conditions:</p><ul><li><p>You are a beginner or want to start using payment gateways to process payments on your online projects.</p></li><li><p>You are a Laravel or PHP developer and you want to integrate the best payment platforms in your projects.</p></li><li><p>You are an entrepreneur, and you want to start creating your online services and receive money with them.</p></li><li><p>You are an expert in web development and you need to integrate multiple payment platforms in the same project, without spending time understanding official articles and documents.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>The benefits you will get</p><ul><li><p>The freedom to implement solutions once and let your products and services sell online without having to be there every time.</p></li><li><p>The feeling of professional growth and building real and incredible projects.</p></li><li><p>Build any Laravel project that can collect payments online automatically, using the most important payment platforms.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>So that said all this...</p><p>Do not wait for more.

  "description": "<p>This course is about writing javascript in functional way with using such a popular library as Lodash. Javascript doesn't have enough functions to cover all our needs so Lodash helps us to write efficient and cross-browser code. The code is written with small, pure functions is easy to support, reuse, improve and test. </p><p>But it's not an easy task because the amount of function in lodash is huge and they cover lot's of different use cases. It's important to understand its principles, the most needed functions and how we can combine and reuse them. The course will help you to learn Lodash step by step from the very beginning to professional developer.</p><p>We won't simply go through all functions or learn the documentation. There are lots of quizzes from real usecases for you to try using Lodash on you own and compare your results with my solution.</p><p>What you will learn in this course:</p><ul><li><p>Array and object transformations</p></li><li><p>Grouping and sorting</p></li><li><p>Composing functions</p></li><li><p>Working with string and arrays</p></li><li><p>Cloning and assigning properties</p></li><li><p>Checking the types</p></li><li><p>Debounce and throttle</p></li><li><p>Extending lodash with own functions</p></li><li><p>And much more...</p></li></ul><p>If you are feeling like you want a deep dive into efficient javascript to improve the quality and scalability of your code then this course is for you.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Unlock the Power of APIs with Python and FastAPI!</strong></p><p>Ready to transform your Python skills into building blazing-fast, production-ready APIs? This hands-on course is your definitive guide to crafting high-performance APIs using FastAPI and Python.</p><p>Go beyond theory and build a complete backend API for a real-world <strong>Delivery Management System</strong>. You'll master essential backend concepts like the request/response cycle, data modeling, databases, asynchronous programming, and dependency injection – all while leveraging the power of FastAPI's built-in features: asynchronous speed, automatic data validation, OpenAPI support, and exceptional developer productivity.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Python</strong></p><p>Even though having a basic understanding of python is required, core language concepts like type hinting, decorator functions, context managers, async programming and others will still be covered.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SQL&nbsp;Database</strong></p><p>We will cover databases and SQL&nbsp;from the basics. Especially if you're a beginner, we will first learn the need for structured databases, what SQL is, how to define tables and write SQL&nbsp;queries.</p><p>Then we will integrate a SQLite database manually with our FastAPI application and then leverage modern tools like SQLModel to define database table schema and FastAPI's powerful dependency injection to provide database session to API&nbsp;endpoints.</p><p>After covering the essentials, we will move onto advanced concepts like asynchronous database (PostgreSQL), manage schema changes with alembic migrations, define one-to-many and many-to-many SQL&nbsp;relationships and link models.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>User Authentication</strong></p><p>FastAPI&nbsp;has built-in support for OAuth2 Scheme. Implement secure user authentication with OAuth2 Password Flow and handle user signups, email verification of registered users, login, control access to endpoints with JWT, allow password resets and logout users.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Email and SMS Notifications</strong></p><p>In our delivery management system, we will send email updates and sms to recipients on shipment updates. Like sending tracking links with email on order placed, shipment status updates, and sending verification codes or OTP as sms to recieve shipments.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>API&nbsp;Testing</strong></p><p>Learn the basics of the pytest - testing framework. Write and run simple tests, and use fixtures to manage test state. Then, write test for API endpoints with FastAPI's built-in test client.</p><p>We will cover required concepts when testing APIs like setting up test databases, overriding dependencies, authentication in test functions and automate testing with schemathesis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Frontend?</strong></p><p>As a bonus, we will also cover frontend web development with React JS. Covering the essentials like components, state management, hooks, context providers and routing. Using modern and meme proof tools like Vite, Axios, React Router, Shadcn UI, and Tanstack React Query.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Docker</strong></p><p>Learn the industry standard tool for packaging applications. We will cover the basics of docker and the essential concepts of containerisation. And run our API&nbsp;Server, PostgreSQL database, Redis and Celery background worker seamlessly with Docker Compose.</p><p><br></p><p>If you're a Python developer looking to create fast, reliable, and modern web APIs, and if you're eager to understand and build the backend yourself, then this course is your perfect starting point.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Join us in the first lesson and start building today!</strong></p>",

You learn how to classify a website in one of the two categories and then apply the right concept in order to scrape the data you want.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Now you will learn how to <strong>export</strong> the scraped data either as <strong>CSV or JSON</strong>. These are some popular formats that can be used for further processing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately many websites try to block scrapers or sometimes you just do not want to be detected. In the section <em>going undercover</em> <strong>you will learn how to stay undetected and avoid getting blocked</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the course you can download the <strong>full source code</strong> of all the lectures and we discuss an <strong>outlook to some advanced topics</strong> (private proxies, cloud deployment, multi threading ...). Those advanced topics are covered in a follow up course I am going to teach.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why you should take this course</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Stop imagining you can scrape data from websites and use the skills for your next web project, you can do it now.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Stay ahead of your competition</strong></li><li><strong>Be more efficient and automate tedious, manual tasks</strong></li><li><strong>Increase your value by adding web scraping to your skill set</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enroll now!</p>",

Unveiling a plethora of functionalities beneath its hood, Django's magical elements expedite the learning curve, enabling users to swiftly get started with their projects. As an adept tool for building basic applications, Django excels in its user-friendly approach. However, as projects evolve in complexity, Django demands a deeper understanding and customization to unleash its full potential.</p><p><br></p><p>The framework boasts exceptional speed, robust security features, and inherent power. A noteworthy feature is its built-in admin panel, a convenient attribute that eliminates the need for developers to create one for their web applications. This pre-built component streamlines the development process, allowing developers to focus on crafting the core features of their applications.</p><p><br></p><p>In the dynamic landscape of website development, Django has witnessed exponential growth over the past seven years. Despite the myriad of frameworks available, Django has emerged as a frontrunner, surpassing the popularity of competitors like Laravel, as indicated by StackOverflow metrics. The framework's continuous improvement, coupled with a thriving community, contributes to its sustained ascent. The momentum has not waned; Django's community continues to expand, making it an ideal choice for those looking to delve into web development.</p><p><br></p><p>The evolving nature of Django, marked by ongoing enhancements and an ever-growing community, positions it as an optimal framework for learning. Aspiring developers can harness Django's prowess to not only keep pace with the dynamic demands of web development but also to stay ahead in a field that is continually evolving. Embrace Django, and join the vibrant community that propels its constant evolution – a journey that promises both current relevance and future-proof skills.</p>",

It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, \"What can I do to become a better web developer faster?\" The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What is JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a curly-braced, dynamically typed, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language. It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.</p><p><strong>Why is JavaScript important?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development.</p><p><strong>What is HTML and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML stands for hyper-text markup language. Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned. Today, HTML is much more complex and dynamic, allowing front-end developers to create any layout or setup they desire.</p><p><strong>Why is CSS and Javascript important for HTML?</strong></p><p>HTML is a formatting language, not a programming language. Javascript is often necessary to make HTML “dynamic.” While HTML can make it so that text is displayed on the screen, Javascript can update this text or make it move. Javascript is used for both front-end and back-end development, hand-in-hand with HTML, to create complex and attractive web designs. Meanwhile, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to organize the look and feel of a website and make the website easier to update and manipulate. Today, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are frequently used to develop responsive web designs — designs that react to a user’s environment for a better user experience.</p><p><strong>What is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)?</strong></p><p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used to style markup language. Markup languages include HTML, XHML, XML, and other XML-based languages. The most common use of CSS is to style HTML web pages. Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it. With CSS, you can target specific elements in a web page and change the look and arrangement on the page. CSS can make an embedded image small or cover the entire webpage as a background. You can enlarge a heading and apply a specific font to stand out from the rest of the page. Other things you can do with CSS include changing the color of elements, making elements float to one side of the page, and the list goes on. Every web page uses HTML, and every web page that has its unique look uses CSS.</p><p><strong>What careers use CSS?</strong></p><p>CSS applies to any career that involves web development. Web designers create the templates, mockups, and styles for a website using HTML and CSS that web developers use to build websites. Front-end web developers use CSS with HTML and JavaScript to build front-end web applications that run in the browser. Fullstack web developers create both the part of a web application that runs in the browser and on the server and need to know CSS to make the front-end look good. Content managers may need to know CSS to apply custom styles to articles they publish through a content management system like WordPress. Other job titles that may require you to know CSS include junior web developer, social media manager, website editor, content editor, website project manager, website support specialist, and webmaster.</p><p><strong>What is React Native?</strong></p><p>Created by Facebook, React Native is an open-source-based mobile application framework that uses only JavaScript, making it capable of supporting both Android and iOS platforms. React, also known as React.js, saves time and effort for developers since they only need one programming language. The Native element allows developers to create JavaScript components to design software programs that run on various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, smart TVs, and laptops. With React Native, developers use the same concepts used in the original React framework to design a rich mobile user interface (UI) for various environments from existing components.</p><p><strong>What careers use React Native?</strong></p><p>Businesses that want to create mobile apps for iOS and Android simultaneously to ensure a seamless rollout need developers with a background in React Native. Careers in mobile app development that rely on React Native can count on professionals who can design and build stunning UIs in multiple platforms since it works hand-in-hand with platforms like Windows and tvOS. React Native developers are also vital to helping iOS, and Android companies update and otherwise modernize their apps with features like push notifications and animation for better effectiveness for mobile app subscribers. Developers with a background in React Native might work in full-stack development, designing and refining web-based games, websites, mobile apps, and more.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and Google Flutter?</strong></p><p>Google Flutter offers developers a UI toolkit that has some similarities to React Native. Flutter also has a native component and compiles web, mobile, and desktop applications from a single collection of source codes. Relying on existing code, Flutter is also a free and open-source framework for developers. Until this point, the two frameworks might sound similar. However, React Native is based on and only uses JavaScript, while Flutter only has a loose connection to the language. Google Flutter primarily uses a new language called Dart. Other differences between the two involve sourcing the tool itself and the installation process, setup and configuration, UI component and development, and community support.</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>What is Node.Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications. It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time. By using JavaScript, node.Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript. Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux). Node.js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast. Examples of applications that use node.Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node.Js?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is open-source, meaning it’s free code for all developers. On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node.Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base. Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node.Js environment continues to be enhanced. Because Node.Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment. It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training. Node.Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node.Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs. It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run). Node.Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required. Because Node.Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs. The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time. It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies.<br><strong><br>No prior knowledge is needed!</strong></p><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong></p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching.</p><p>When you enroll, you will feel our seasoned instructors' expertise.</p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience.</p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now </p><p><strong>Full Stack Web Development with Mern Full Stack Project</strong></p><p>We offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Do you want to develop your skills further as a developer? Did you build a couple of projects with PHP and MySQL, but you still think you are inexperienced and you are missing out on a lot of things when coming to developing bigger projects? If yes, then this course is the right resource for you. This course is very digestible and informative and it was created specifically to enhance your coding skills and knowledge not just in PHP and MySQL, but overall in developing web projects. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Here is what we are going to do in this course. Naturally, we are going to get started by setting up the right tools for our projects. And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that's a URL shortening service. The second project will be about sending emails in PHP and that's very important because it's a feature that almost every website has. The next project will be the starting of something big because it's an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that's a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. The last project will be about building a weather app. All we are going to do is set up a form, allow the user to enter a city, and then give him the current degree of this city. So we will use an API to grab the current degree for this city. If that sounds like something that you are interested in, go ahead and get the course now. see you inside!! </p>",

  "description": "<p>Containers have revolutionized modern software development by enabling faster, more consistent application deployment across environments. However, with this transformation comes a growing security challenge: vulnerabilities and misconfigurations can quickly escalate into major security incidents. As containerized applications increasingly rely on orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, implementing strong security measures is no longer optional—it's critical.</p><p>This comprehensive course provides a practical, structured approach to securing containerized environments, with a particular focus on Kubernetes. This course begins with an overview of the foundational technologies—exploring the architecture of containers and Kubernetes, as well as the typical application development and deployment lifecycle. From there, it shifts to analyzing potential attack surfaces and common threat vectors that can compromise containerized applications.</p><p>To address these risks, we will go over a five-factor security model designed specifically for Kubernetes ecosystems. You’ll learn how to apply this model to protect every stage of your environment—from development to production. The course covers best practices for securing design and code, container images and registries, individual containers and host systems, applications, and Kubernetes clusters themselves.</p><p>Whether you're a DevOps engineer, developer, or security professional, this course equips you with the knowledge and tools needed to build more resilient, secure containerized applications in today’s dynamic cloud-native landscape.\t</p>",

It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, \"What can I do to become a better web developer faster?\" The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What are the most popular coding languages for web development?</strong></p><p>The must-know languages for frontend web development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages are used by nearly every site you visit. JavaScript is a fundamental programming language for adding interactivity to your website. There are many popular JavaScript libraries that you can import and allow you to add useful functionality while dramatically decreasing the amount of code you might write, and offering features that would be difficult or time-consuming to code yourself. Once you are comfortable with JavaScript, you will want to explore the many libraries available. There are many other programming languages that you can use for web development. If you want to write backend code, you will need to learn a language that runs on the server that powers your website (as opposed to the web browser, where frontend code is executed). Consider learning Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. It can be helpful to research which backend language is popular in the field that interests you most.</p><p><strong>What are the skills I need to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>You'll need to be able to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Mastering these three languages is essential for web development. They each serve a crucial function: HTML is the content itself – the words, pictures, etc., CSS controls how all of that content looks, and JavaScript makes a website interactive. Luckily, you can learn all three languages on your own using online tools and courses. To be a good web developer, you'll also need many skills beyond programming languages. A crucial professional skill is problem-solving. Good problem-solving skills will help you to track down bugs quickly and develop algorithms to complete complex tasks. Interpersonal skills are also necessary for the job, such as communication and collaboration. Many web development projects require a team of developers. To succeed in web development, you must work well in team environments.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between front-end, back-end, and full-stack web development?</strong></p><p>Frontend web developers write client-side code. This is all the code that runs on the user's computer when they visit a website. Generally, this includes everything that the user can see. To write frontend code, you need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Backend web developers write server-side code. This is all the code that runs on the website's server. Backend code controls the logic of the website. For example, a frontend developer may code where a username will appear on a website and its style, but the backend developer will write the code that retrieves the username from the database. Backend developers need to know a server-side programming language in addition to HTML and JavaScript. Not all projects have a front and backend web developer. Some projects only have full-stack web developers, which do both front and backend coding. The team composition depends on the needs of the project. Full-stack web developers need to be strong front and backend coders.</p><p><strong>What is Python?</strong></p><p>Python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.</p><p><strong>Python vs. R: what is the Difference?</strong></p><p>Python and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R, you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Python is object-oriented?</strong></p><p>Python is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping. The concept of combining data with functionality in an object is called encapsulation, a core concept in the object-oriented programming paradigm.</p><p><strong>What are the limitations of Python?</strong></p><p>Python is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant making Python even more popular.</p><p><strong>How is Python used?</strong></p><p>Python is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library, although there are currently some drawbacks Python needs to overcome when it comes to mobile development.</p><p><strong>What jobs use Python?</strong></p><p>Python is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.</p><p><strong>How do I learn Python on my own?</strong></p><p>Python has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go. Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals. If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development. If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too. Udemy’s online courses are a great place to start if you want to learn Python on your own.</p><p><strong>What is Django?</strong></p><p>Django is a Python-based Web Application Framework that follows the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. As one of the most popular Web Application Frameworks available today, Django has an extensive amount of documentation and extensions available. It is also built primarily for data-driven websites. A non-profit organization and an active community of developers contribute to Django’s platform, which is both open-source and free. The advantages of using Django are rapid development and less code. Django also provides an administrative interface and many bundled components. Websites such as The Washington Times, Instagram, and Nextdoor used Django for development, and employers frequently seek Django developers and Python specialists for web development.</p><p><strong>What is Django used for?</strong></p><p>As an MVC Web Application Framework, many use Django to develop and deploy web applications rapidly. Django makes it easier for developers to hit the ground running rather than having to build the entirety of their platform from scratch. Mainly, Django is useful for those who are experts in Python — data models, settings, and files all use the Python language. In development since 2005, Django is a mature Web Application Framework with a significant amount of documentation and support, making its utilization attractive to those building complex, data-driven applications. Because Django is well-supported and robust, developers can use Django for large, enterprise-grade applications — but you can also use it for simpler applications.</p><p><strong>Who uses Django?</strong></p><p>Python programmers who are interested in a low code development prefer Django for its “don’t repeat yourself” model. Ideally, Django can create streamlined programs that require little coding to initialize. It has a significant body of architecture within its components and libraries, and you can administer it internally. Developers primarily use Django for web applications that need to balance large amounts of data and significant loads. Over 2,500 packages are available to extend Django’s behavior, making it a particularly robust platform. Developers interested in using Django can check to see if the functionality they desire already exists. Django is also often favored by full-stack developers who want to be able to build web applications from start to finish, as you can use it for both frontend and backend design.</p><p><strong>Is Django frontend or backend?</strong></p><p>Frontend design is related to what the user sees and interacts with. Backend is concerned primarily with the data. Django is both a frontend and backend Web Application Framework, unlike platforms like JavaScript’s Bootstrap, which you can use for frontend design. Django concerns itself primarily with the application’s interior workings, such as data manipulation, but is also useful for end-to-end frontend and backend design. A developer familiar with Django may be able to develop their web application “full-stack,” developing the entirety of the web application from front to back. However, frontend and backend work in Django can be separated if desired, meaning you can use Django for one or the other with some work. When separated in this way, Django is compatible with other frontend or backend technology.</p><p><strong>What are the key considerations when deciding on a Web Application Framework?</strong></p><p>There are both open-source, free Web Application Frameworks and commercial, proprietary frameworks. The latter is more expensive, but it will generally come with more support. Web Application Frameworks usually focus on a specific language. Django works with Python. Additionally, every Web Application Framework has its own level of complexity and learning curve, documentation, and support. Most web developers will want a Web Application Framework in a language they are fluent in. A solid library of extensions and plug-ins is also ideal as it reduces the amount of work the developer will need to do. Since the Web Application Framework has a lot to do with how a system functions, the system's look-and-feel may also come into play, as may other quality of life issues such as the robustness of the administrative panel.</p><p><strong>What is the model-view-controler (MVC) architectural pattern?</strong></p><p>The Model-View-Controller architectural pattern (MVC) is a type of software pattern for creating user interfaces. It standardizes how information flows through an application and makes it easier for developers to control all levels, from frontend to backend. Many Web Application Frameworks today follow the MVC model. Under the MVC architecture, the “model” refers to the data. The “view” refers to the display. Finally, the “controller” refers to the way that both models and views are updated. By retaining this consistency, multiple developers can also work together (both frontend and backend) without potentially retreading ground or overwriting essential items. The MVC model makes it easier to manage interconnected elements while ensuring that the application functions as a whole. MVC is compatible with desktop, mobile, and web application designs.</p><p><strong>What careers use Django?</strong></p><p>As a Python-based web framework, Django is primarily used by web developers. Because developers can use Django for both front- and backend web development, it's useful for frontend developers, backend web developers, and full-stack web developers. Large enterprises such as Instagram, Mozilla, and Pinterest are driven by Django and contribute to the Django community. Everyone from entry-level web developers to senior web architects can make a promising career with Django.</p><p><strong>What are some alternatives to Django?</strong></p><p>In the world of Python-based web frameworks, there are dozens of contenders. Flask is a popular Django alternative. Those who are new to web development may find Flask easy to adapt to, as its structure is clean and rigid. Both are based on Python, but Django requires more individualized knowledge. Another popular alternative to Django is TurboGears. TurboGears does not have the feature set of Django but has some extensive database management support. Other alternatives include Web2Py, Tornado, and CherryPy. When looking at Django, Flask, TurboGears, and other frameworks, it's important to contemplate a few factors: price, support, community, features, and integration. While many are better for niche situations, developers often consider Django to be the best all-around.</p><p><strong>What is HTML and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML stands for hyper-text markup language. Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned. Today, HTML is much more complex and dynamic, allowing front-end developers to create any layout or setup they desire.</p><p><strong>Why are CSS and Javascript important for HTML?</strong></p><p>HTML is a formatting language, not a programming language. Javascript is often necessary to make HTML “dynamic.” While HTML can make it so that text is displayed on the screen, Javascript can update this text or make it move. Javascript is used for both front-end and back-end development, hand-in-hand with HTML, to create complex and attractive web designs. Meanwhile, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to organize the look and feel of a website and make the website easier to update and manipulate. Today, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are frequently used to develop responsive web designs — designs that react to a user’s environment for a better user experience.</p><p><strong>What is an HTML element and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML is designed on a modular basis, meaning every part of the web page has a specific “place.” An HTML element is a part of the page. Common HTML elements include “&lt;p&gt;” for a “paragraph” and “&lt;title&gt;” for the “title” of the page. In fact, the entirety of the HTML page is within the “&lt;html&gt;” element. Elements are begun and ended with tags, so a title would be written: “&lt;title&gt;This is the Title to the page.&lt;/title&gt;” Organizing code this way makes it easier to reference and control. Each element may also have characteristics. For instance, the “&lt;p&gt;” (paragraph) tag can be aligned in a certain direction. These are the basic building blocks of HTML and what most designers should learn first.</p><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching. </p><p>When you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned instructors' expertise.&nbsp; </p><p><strong><em>Fresh Content</em></strong></p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate.

  "description": "<p><strong>As a creative, an online portfolio is an absolute must to establish your career.</strong></p><p>Whether you’re a photographer, fashion director, graphic designer, or architect creating an online portfolio is an absolute must to establish your career. It's what allows you to differentiate yourself from others, showcase your projects and skills, and demonstrate that you can bring something unique to the table. Here are some benefits that every creative professional can enjoy by creating an online design portfolio.</p><p><strong>Increase online visibility</strong></p><p>According to Glassdoor, more and more hiring managers are Googling their applicants before interviews, and not surprisingly, one of the top things they look for is an online portfolio. it’s reassuring to know that you get to decide what comes up on that first page. Will it be pictures of your Friday nights or a professional profile that shows your story and skills? Deck your Google search with social media posts, articles you authored, and most importantly, an online portfolio that showcases the best of your work.</p><p><strong>Open up for potential clients</strong></p><p>If you’re a freelancer, having an online portfolio is the best way to detail your services and open the door wide open for potential clients. This is how Lukas Lienhard, a freelance photographer, attracts clients who wouldn’t have gotten in touch with him if it weren’t for his website. His online portfolio works as a “landing page” for his personal brand, where clients can easily see what his personality, interests, and skillsets are...</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Advantages of a Portfolio</em></strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Online presence</strong> The days of the paper resume are fading fast. Today when employers consider a potential job candidate, a google search is one of the first screening tools they employ. When you have a digital portfolio, you have a powerful tool to shape your online presence.</p></li><li><p><strong>Know what you know</strong> A digital portfolio requires you to write narratives that give details about the skills and experiences that appear on your CV or resume. Writing these narratives gives you a chance to articulate your professional story--the core of your qualifications, the nuances of your professional identity. There's no better preparation for interview questions than creating a portfolio.</p></li><li><p><strong>A deeper look</strong> Today all professionals should have a social media presence. LinkedIn, and Twitter/Facebook. But a digital portfolio goes beyond social media. A digital portfolio lets your LinkedIn profile (and any other social media presence you have) lead colleagues and potential employers to a place where they can explore your career more deeply than any social media profile allows. A job history on LinkedIn--with a link to your digital portfolio added--becomes an in-depth story about your ability to work in a team, lead a project, or innovate in your field.</p></li></ol><p>This is a video course full of real downloadable code examples. You'll be able to take the knowledge, as well as the real working code, to your projects and make sure they stand out.</p><ul><li><p>Responsive Web Design</p></li><li><p>Create Responsive Website Using HTML5 CSS3</p></li><li><p>frontend developers</p></li><li><p>website designer</p></li><li><p>Html Developers</p></li><li><p>Learn Web Development Courses and Tutorials</p></li><li><p>how to make a responsive website using Html CSS Javascript</p></li><li><p>Build a real-world responsive website</p></li><li><p>javascript front end tutorial</p></li><li><p>front end developer course</p></li><li><p>front end development tutorials</p></li><li><p>Learn Web Development Courses and Tutorials</p></li><li><p>responsive website design from scratch 2020</p></li><li><p>Design A Complete Responsive Business Website From Scratch</p></li><li><p>html5 + css3 responsive web design</p></li><li><p>Learn Modern Responsive Web Design With Example Step by Step</p></li><li><p>Responsive Html5 CSS3 Website</p></li><li><p>Web Design For Beginners</p></li><li><p>Build A Modern Looking Responsive Websites</p></li><li><p>Learn Responsive Web Design From Scratch</p></li><li><p>Real World Coding in HTML &amp; CSS</p></li><li><p>Html5 CSS3 and Javascript: A Guide To Web Design From Scratch</p></li><li><p>Web Design HTML CSS Create Single Page Website from Scratch</p></li><li><p>Front End Web Development</p></li></ul><p><strong>Help and inspiration?</strong></p><p>Not only do you get a load of practical, useful starting projects in this course, you can also head over to CSS Animation.rocks for more, and even sign up to a weekly newsletter packed full of tutorials, inspiration, and tips for animating on the web.</p><p><strong>There’s no better time to learn Animations:&nbsp;</strong>You’ve made a smart choice because CSS 3 Animations is the most popular language out there. This is no exaggeration. This popularity and growth mean more jobs and opportunities than ever before.</p><p><strong>Get access to fast support if you get stuck: </strong>There’s nothing worse than getting stuck ten hours into a course and not getting the help you need to continue. Getting stuck is part of the learning process. That’s why I’m here to answer every single question that comes my way.</p><p>I guarantee that this is the most up-to-date and engaging course available, and it comes with a Udemy 30-day money-back guarantee.</p><p>I can’t wait to see you inside, Let's Hope in to the <strong>COURSE</strong>!</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- <strong>B.

Its really important to learn Javascript formally, because it is just so different from most other languages you would have encountered. For instance - Javascript has objects and inheritance but no classes.<strong></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Closures</strong> in Javascript are a rather mind-bending concept - functions that \"remember\" how the world looked when they were created.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Prototypes</strong> are Javascript's way of doing inheritance, and its very different from the C++/Java way of doing it.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>JSON</strong> is not conceptually difficult to use, but it is incredibly important, and you should understand why - because its the glue between backends written in Java or other traditional languages, and front-ends written in Javascript</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The Document-Object-Model</strong> is what ties Javascript back to HTML and CSS.

  "description": "<p>One of the most powerful components of Django is the automatic admin interface. It provides a quick, database centric interface that authenticated users can use to manage content on a Django site.</p><p>However, the Django admin exposes an API which is unique and quite different from all the other components that ship with Django, such as the auth app. This makes it difficult for Django developers to take full advantage of the admin dashboard.</p><p>This course, exclusively on the Django admin, aims at solving that. It will arm the student with expert knowledge on how to master, supercharge and be productive with the Django admin.</p>",

  "description": "<p>React uses declarative instead of imperative syntax. It’s a simpler way of developing apps, and you can learn why here.</p><p>Basically, React is faster to develop with because you don’t need to tell the app how to represent the state — you just need to say what you’d like to happen. It’s quick, it’s easy, and there’s less room for human error.</p><p>You may have heard of the phrase “Write once, run anywhere” before. React Native brings that kind of philosophy to React with “Learn once, write anywhere”.</p><p>Once you understand the basic architecture and thinking behind React, you’ll be able to develop fully functioning apps for both Android and iOS. You won’t have to learn two different ways to represent your app. So after you learn React, you can bring your new product to users not just as quickly as possible, but as widely as possible.</p><p>React has a massive community of dedicated developers. The community helps to maintain and grow the open-source library, with everyone able to contribute their own components to the library.</p><p>The community is also so strong because of the great tools you can work with in React, including React Profiler and React devtools.</p><p>React saves you time and money on development because it’s component-based. You can break down an interface into reusable components that allow you to build dynamic user interfaces.</p><p>This taps into the current thinking behind ‘Design Systems’. These enable developers to provide a single source of truth for designers, ensuring consistency for large companies working across multiple tech platforms.</p>",

I’ve spent over 10,000 hours in the Bubble editor building all of the technology for my startup, and I’m an official Bubble coach and bootcamp instructor that has helped thousands of others build and launch their own ideas.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the most important things that I have learned throughout my experience using Bubble, is that the best way to learn the platform is by learning its core fundamental features - design (front end), workflows (backend), and data (backend), all within the context of building a substantial feature-set of one particular type of application. </p><p><br></p><p>But its not only about becoming proficient at the core features - what separates the good developers from the great bubble developers is learning how to tie together design, workflows, and data, in the unique way that you want, so that you can truly build whatever startup or app idea from scratch!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>In this course that includes 13 hours of content broken down into 8 concise sections, I&nbsp;will teach you how to build GrubMore, a food delivery app. </strong>GrubMore is a fully interactive, dynamic application that would traditionally take tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of traditional engineering time to build. But with Bubble, you'll do it 10x as fast and more than 100x cheaper, and learn what is destined to become the future of programming in the process!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>In particular you'll learn:</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>How to design a landing page</p></li><li><p>How to handle user authentication (signing up and logging in)</p></li><li><p>How to build databases efficiently so that we can keep track of restaurants, menu items, and delivery orders</p></li><li><p>How to display data from the database (backend)&nbsp;on the user interface (front end)&nbsp;of our app</p></li><li><p>How to create programmatic workflows so that we can add interactivity and backend operations to our application</p></li><li><p>How to create an interactive shopping cart and food ordering experience, which is the course capstone that ties together all learning of the core features of the Bubble platform together.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Included with every purchase is the final application template, </strong>so that as you're building the app, you can compare your results to those of the completed application. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>So what are you waiting for?!</strong> Take the leap of faith you've always wanted and join the no code programming movement by beginning your Bubble journey with me today!</p>",

It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.</p><p><strong>Why is JavaScript important?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development.</p><p><strong>What are the main uses of JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used for client- and server-side development. Web developers have used JavaScript since its inception to add simple interactivity to web pages like modals, animated elements, or image slideshows. While that is still one of its primary uses, Javascript has evolved to building complete web applications. SPAs, or single page applications, depend on JavaScript-based frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue to bring a desktop-like application experience to the browser. However, it's important to note that web browsers aren't places that make good use of the programming language. Javascript is also popular for building web services and back-end infrastructure with Node.js. React Native, Xamarin, Ionic, and NativeScript frameworks use JavaScript for developing phone apps as well.</p><p><strong>React vs. Angular vs. Vue: what is the best JavaScript framework?</strong></p><p>Choosing the best JavaScript framework for your web project depends on what you are looking for. React is a popular framework, which means you will find a lot of community support if you need help. It is also considered relatively easy to learn but is being developed at a rapid pace. Angular is a framework that makes data binding easy so that you can template an application faster. It also uses the RxJS library to simplify asynchronous programming and Typescript (which compiles to JavaScript) for a cleaner, less error-prone development process. Some cons of Angular are that it can have a steep learning curve and can be complex. Vue is a lightweight framework, so it is easy to learn, very performant, and flexible. Some cons of Vue are limited plugins, and its flexibility can lead to irregular code.</p><p><strong>What is HTML and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML stands for hyper-text markup language. Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned. Today, HTML is much more complex and dynamic, allowing front-end developers to create any layout or setup they desire.</p><p><strong>Why is CSS and Javascript important for HTML?</strong></p><p>HTML is a formatting language, not a programming language. Javascript is often necessary to make HTML “dynamic.” While HTML can make it so that text is displayed on the screen, Javascript can update this text or make it move. Javascript is used for both front-end and back-end development, hand-in-hand with HTML, to create complex and attractive web designs. Meanwhile, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to organize the look and feel of a website and make the website easier to update and manipulate. Today, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are frequently used to develop responsive web designs — designs that react to a user’s environment for a better user experience.</p><p><strong>What is an HTML element and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML is designed on a modular basis, meaning every part of the web page has a specific “place.” An HTML element is a part of the page. Common HTML elements include “&lt;p&gt;” for a “paragraph” and “&lt;title&gt;” for the “title” of the page. In fact, the entirety of the HTML page is within the “&lt;html&gt;” element. Elements are begun and ended with tags, so a title would be written: “&lt;title&gt;This is the Title to the page.&lt;/title&gt;” Organizing code this way makes it easier to reference and control. Each element may also have characteristics. For instance, the “&lt;p&gt;” (paragraph) tag can be aligned in a certain direction. These are the basic building blocks of HTML and what most designers should learn first.</p><p><strong>What is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)?</strong></p><p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used to style markup language. Markup languages include HTML, XHML, XML, and other XML-based languages. The most common use of CSS is to style HTML web pages. Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it. With CSS, you can target specific elements in a web page and change the look and arrangement on the page. CSS can make an embedded image small or cover the entire webpage as a background. You can enlarge a heading and apply a specific font to stand out from the rest of the page. Other things you can do with CSS include changing the color of elements, making elements float to one side of the page, and the list goes on. Every web page uses HTML, and every web page that has its unique look uses CSS.</p><p><strong>What careers use CSS?</strong></p><p>CSS applies to any career that involves web development. Web designers create the templates, mockups, and styles for a website using HTML and CSS that web developers use to build websites. Front-end web developers use CSS with HTML and JavaScript to build front-end web applications that run in the browser. Fullstack web developers create both the part of a web application that runs in the browser and on the server and need to know CSS to make the front-end look good. Content managers may need to know CSS to apply custom styles to articles they publish through a content management system like WordPress. Other job titles that may require you to know CSS include junior web developer, social media manager, website editor, content editor, website project manager, website support specialist, and webmaster.</p><p><strong>What skills should I have before learning CSS?</strong></p><p>Before learning CSS, you should know the basics of using a computer and how to use a text editor because that is where you will be writing CSS. You should also be familiar with web browsers for browsing the web because it will inform your use of CSS. Since you may end up using specialized tools to write CSS, you should know how to install software on your computer and create and manage files and folders on your computer so you can create a CSS project. Once you have those skills down, the next thing to learn is HTML; after all, CSS is nothing without an HTML page to apply styles. That should be the basics you need to know to get started with CSS.</p><p><strong>No prior knowledge is needed!</strong></p><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching. </p><p>When you enroll, you will feel our seasoned instructors' expertise.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience. </p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong> You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now <strong> Javascript, HTML and CSS | HTML CSS Javascript for Beginners</strong> course</p><p>We offer&nbsp;<strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p>When writing Node.js applications, it’s absolutely imperative that we employ battle-tested guidelines that can help us write efficient and resilient code. These guidelines are known as design patterns. Design patterns are an important part of software development and are a proven way of solving a given problem.</p><p>In this course, you’ll take a comprehensive look at industry-standard design patterns, identify challenges that you would commonly encounter while designing and developing software, and implement solutions in Node.js applications. The efficacy of these patterns has been proven over time and a lot of these standard patterns can be implemented when writing JavaScript apps with Node.js.</p><p>By implementing design patterns, you can write code that is crafted for efficiency and reusability and is resilient against errors and typical pitfalls that result from poorly written code.</p><p>This course uses Node.js 10.8.0, and JavaScript ES8, while not the latest version available, it provides relevant and informative content for legacy users of Node.js, and JavaScript.</p><p><strong>About the Author</strong></p><p><strong>Sachin Bhatnagar</strong> began dabbling with Computer Programming and graphics at the age of 14 on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum that ran the BASIC programming language.</p><p>During the early 2000s, Sachin forayed into Computer Graphics and Visual Effects training and production. From developing world-class curricula to imparting training to over five thousand students in the classroom and over twenty-five thousand online, Sachin has actively contributed to fueling innovation, creating brand identities, and crafting innovative software solutions for corporate companies and individuals alike.</p><p>He has also worked with one of India’s leading media and entertainment training companies as a vice president. Having said all this, Sachin's first love is coding and he strongly emphasizes its importance to one and all. His passion for education and love for coding has culminated in several courses on technology. His expertise lies in JavaScript, Node.js, Vue.js, Chatbots, and the list keeps growing all the time.</p>",

  "description": "<p>In this project-based course, we will build a location-based real estate website. It is going to be a full stack web application with Django powering the backend and React Js the frontend.</p><p>We are going to build the frontend very fast by using Material UI which is a very easy and intuitive React library for building UI components. Throughout the course we will get to use lots of Material UI components that we will easily style.</p><p>We are then going to build the API with Django Rest Framework (DRF) and we are going to make requests to the API with React.</p><p>Leaflet is a JavaScript library for building interactive maps. We will add a geographic aspect to this project by placing the property listings on a map. We are going to achieve that with React-Leaflet which provides a binding between React and Leaflet.</p><p>We are also going to make our PostgreSQL database be spatially aware by adding the PostGIS extension to it. So, on top of making regular queries to the database, we are also going to make spatial queries (geometric information such as distance).</p><p>We are also going to cover user authentication with the Djoser library. We will get end users to add, delete or update property listings from the frontend. We are also going to handle both client-side errors and server-side errors in the forms.</p><p>Once we are done building the website on our local machines, we will then deploy it with Digital Ocean and Namecheap. During deployment, we are going to:</p><ul><li><p>Push our project to GitHub</p></li><li><p>Get domain names for the backend and frontend</p></li><li><p>Setup a mailbox in “private email”</p></li><li><p>Setup an SSL certificate</p></li><li><p>Install and setup Nginx and Gunicorn</p></li><li><p>Store media file in the cloud with Digital Ocean spaces</p></li></ul><p>I will be using:</p><ul><li><p>Windows</p></li><li><p>Python 3.9</p></li><li><p>Django 4.0</p></li><li><p>React 17 (Updated for React 18-Works perfectly fine, check out the lectures on the Bonus section for more details)</p></li><li><p>Material UI 5</p></li></ul><p>The following topics will be covered in this course:</p><ul><li><p>The basics of React</p></li><li><p>React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useRef, useMemo)</p></li><li><p>The basics of Material UI</p></li><li><p>Styling with Material UI</p></li><li><p>The basics of React-Leaflet</p></li><li><p>React-Leaflet hooks (exp: useMap)</p></li><li><p>Building API endpoints with Django Rest Framework</p></li><li><p>Authentication with Djoser</p></li><li><p>Django signals</p></li><li><p>Making spatial queries with Geodjango and PostGIS</p></li><li><p>Calculating distances</p></li><li><p>Django deployment</p></li><li><p>React Deployment</p></li><li><p>Creating a remote server</p></li></ul><p>After completing this in-depth project-based course, you will know how to connect Django and React.

  "description": "<p>Have you been trying to learn how to develop websites? Or maybe you are a designer who would like to offer web dev services to your clients?</p><p>You know, designing is one thing, but turning that design into a real website is another. A more complex one I must say.</p><p>And for many, this may look like some sort of witchcraft. When they think of developing websites they get intimidated and just quit.</p><p>Luckily, this really doesn’t have to be the case. Nowadays creating custom, professional websites is easier than ever before.</p><p>So is this course just about that?</p><p>Let me tell you fist what this course is not:</p><ul><li><p>It is definitely not another Wordpress course. If you are a total Wordpress noob, I advise you to first learn the basics and then get back to this course.</p></li><li><p>Wordpress is going to be an environment in which we’ll be working, but we won’t be focusing on it at all</p></li></ul><p>You will learn how to build any kind of website using Oxygen Builder.</p><p>It is a site builder, which means it allows you to design, develop and control ANY aspect of a website: headers, footers, menus, blogs, sliders… you name it.</p><p>What’s distinct about it is that it gives you total control over the development part: it’s really hard to imagine a design that could not be developed with Oxygen.</p><p>And the vast majority of the designs can be turned into websites without even touching the code – you can use the tools provided and not write a single line of code.</p><p>Sure, if you need something more complex, you can add extra code – Oxygen gives you total freedom.</p><p>At first it may seem intimidating, but after a few minutes, especially if you are familiar with any design tool, everything will start to make sense. And of course, I am here to guide you so… fear not!</p><p>Once we’ve installed Oxygen, we will start developing a site and along the way we you will learn various tools and aspects of the plugin:</p><p>We will</p><ul><li><p>build headers (including sticky headers), footers and menus</p></li><li><p>add sliders, including full width background sliders</p></li><li><p>add galleries, icons, videos and portfolios</p></li><li><p>make everything nicely responsive</p></li></ul><p>To finish the course, we will actually grab a ready-made design and recreate it using Oxygen. We will go from the header, through main sections with images, icons and transitions, all the way to an extended footer.</p><p>If you’ve been looking for a course to teach you how to develop professional, custom websites and that would do it straight to the point, you are in the right place.</p><p>Enroll now and see you inside!</p>",

Mastering AngularJS is a great opportunity that will help you getting a new and better job in the web development industry.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reviews</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong></strong>\"The best AngularJS course I have seen\", \"Great course, with clear explanation, easy to follow and a lot of content\", \"Teaching and Learning Angular at it's best\", \"This course is simply awesome ... , after taking this course, I became aware of what I'm doing and what I'm coding\".  </em><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This <strong>AngularJS course</strong> will teach you how this framework can dramatically  <strong>improve your efficiency</strong>, reduce your coding time and deliver your next project as a <strong>Single Page Application (SPA)</strong>.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong> </strong>You'll learn how to create <strong>AngularJS directives</strong>, <strong>controllers</strong>, <strong>modules</strong>, how <strong>2-way data binding </strong>works and<strong>,</strong> more important, <strong>how to build an AngularJS Web Application from scratch</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You'll learn some of the <strong>best practices</strong> and <strong></strong>how to deal with <strong>common mistakes</strong> that a developer can face when dealing with <strong>AngularJS projects</strong> and you'll dig deeper into the built-in components of this technology.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong><strong>AngularJS </strong>is a Javascript framework used to create <strong>Single Page Applications</strong> (SPAs) with a declarative approach. This means that Angular is completely extensible: you can define, for example, your own DSL (Domain Specific Language) and services.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The framework is developed and maintained by <strong>Google</strong>. At the minute it has more then 1.3K contributors on GitHub and is being used in more than 243.000 live websites (Youtube, IndieGoGo, Aerlingus, Virgin America, Forbes are only a few) and is backed by a wide community (more than 122k questions only on stackoverflow). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty between documentation, tutorials, examples and fiddles in additions to discussion groups, specialized sites and forums where you can find inspiration or solutions to common problems.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you are new to AngularJS, no worries. I will drive you through the main topics and will not assume that you are already familiar with the framework.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, If you  already know AngularJS, you know that it can be as sweet as a rainbow unicorn or as bitter as your worst nightmare: this is why we will teach you a few best practices as well as examples of patterns and anti-patterns all over the course, so that you'll learn a more efficient and clear way of coding your NG apps.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Content and Overview</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course you'll find 7+ hours of video content; source code is provided for each lesson and in general there will be 2 downloadable attachments per lesson: the start and final source code; this will let you double check that your changes are correct as long as you proceed throughout each chapter. Links to external resources are also provided where useful. Last but not least, I will support you with each question you might have.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>T</strong><strong>he course is divided in 16 sections,</strong> each one consisting in several videos (more than 63in total) where we will cover the different components of the AngularJS framework.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of course, you will:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Learn how to setup AngularJS  and how its architecture is built; (Installation, MVW approach)</strong></li><li><strong>Acquire familiarity with the main AngularJS components: modules, controllers, routing,  2 way data binding, dependency injection, prototypical inheritance, scopes,  filter, directives, services and templates;</strong></li><li><strong> We will talk a lot about forms, user data validation and filtering. You will learn how to implement a robust form with validation, thanks to Angular Forms and its built-in validator. In other words you will learn how to improve the user experience of your application;</strong></li><li><strong>Learn how to use $http to query a webserver and handle promises in a response;</strong></li><li><strong>Be able to build a full Backend Mock to test your application, by using the Angular $HttpBackend service in the NgMock module;.</strong></li><li><strong>We will dedicate some lessons to custom directives: first a simple implementation then we will unveil the secrets of the \"link function\", how to isolate the scope and how to make directives reusable with any application.</strong></li><li><strong>Transform your App into a Real Time application, and learn how to use Firebase and Angular to make updated content available in Real Time on any device.</strong></li><li><strong>Learn how to secure your application by building Authentication and Authorisation functionalities.</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What you will obtain at the end of the course</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the course you will have a deep understanding of the basic concepts of AngularJS, and you will be ready to start your next project by using this great framework.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Hello there,</p><p>Welcome to <strong>Full Stack Web Development with ReactJS, React Native, Angular</strong> course.</p><p>Full Stack Web Development with React JS, React Native, Angular, NodeJS, MongoDB, and Learn Mobile App Development</p><p><strong>React</strong> is one of the best choices for building modern web applications. If you are new to React or maybe you've been struggling to learn and truly understand what’s going on then this course is the best way for you to learn <strong>React. </strong>React native, react js, react native typescript, react, reactjs, react native web, reactnative, typescript react native, react js and react native, angular react</p><p>Each aspect of creating websites and applications entails a unique set of skills. Udemy offers a host of courses to bring you up to speed on modern front-end, back-end, and fullstack web development practices and skills.</p><p>The world of web development is as wide as the internet itself. Much of our social and vocational lives play out on the internet, which prompts new industries aimed at creating, managing, and debugging the websites and applications that we increasingly rely on.</p><p>React-Native is a library developed by the React team and it is widely used to create mobile applications for both<strong> Android and IOS</strong>. You do not need to learn Java, Android, Swift, Objective-C, or anything of that.&nbsp; <strong>React and JavaScript is all you need </strong>to create awesome mobile apps that work on both Android and iOS.</p><p>Angular is one of the most popular frameworks for building client apps. If you want to <strong>establish yourself as a front-end or a full-stack developer,</strong> you need to learn Angular.</p><p><strong>Node.js</strong> is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. By learning growing web server technology, NodeJS, you can improve your skills, get a new job and you can build powerful, robust web applications.</p><p><strong>MongoDB</strong> is a cross-platform document-oriented <strong>NoSQL</strong> database program. By using MongoDB, you can build a modern application database for your projects.</p><p> We will take you from beginner to advance level.&nbsp; You will learn&nbsp; <strong>React</strong> development <strong>step-by-step with hands-on demonstrations</strong>. To be able to benefit from this course, all you need is a basic understanding of JavaScript.</p><p>JavaScript is one of the most ubiquitous programming languages on the planet, mostly because it's the backbone of interactive web applications. On top of that, JavaScript is a great language for beginners because it gives them a chance to write code that does something visual, which is exciting and helpful when you're just getting started as a programmer. Dynamic content is the hot topic in web development right now. Dynamic content refers to content that constantly changes and adapts to specific users whenever possible. For example, JavaScript can be used to determine if a website visitor is using a computer or a mobile device before deciding whether or not to render the mobile version of the website. It's these small things behind the scenes that create genuine value in using JavaScript to create dynamic web pages.</p><p>In the course, we are going to tell you what dependencies you need to install and how in detail, to be able to create mobile apps on both MAC and Windows. We are going to use free tools and platforms so you don't have to buy any tool or app. You are going to learn how to run an Android and iOS simulator on your MAC or Windows computer.</p><p>Later on the course, we are going to learn the basics of React.&nbsp; JSX, 'props system' and 'state system' are going to be crystal clear for you at the end of the course. </p><p>We tried to tell all complex topics in very detail on the course. We used some diagrams to tell some important topics and created a nice-looking mobile application. We showed two different ways to create a mobile app. We showed both react-native-cli and expo-cli in our course.</p><p>We'll be creating nice-looking reusable components. So you will be able to use this reusable component on your own future projects.On</p><p>In this course, I explained all the complex topics in very detail but by making them simpler which I believe will help you a lot. I used some diagrams to tell some important topics and created a nice looking mobile application.</p><p><strong>At the end of the course you will learn;</strong></p><ul><li><p>Basics of React, React-Native, React-Navigation libraries</p></li><li><p>How to send an HTTP request from a mobile application,</p></li><li><p>How to use the flex-box system,</p></li><li><p>How to create reusable components,</p></li><li><p>To reach another app on the device from our app and</p></li><li><p>Creating your own mobile app both with react-native-cli and expo-cli</p></li><li><p>To reach another app on the device from our app</p></li><li><p>Creating Context with Class Based and Functional Components</p></li><li><p>How to Consume Context in Class Based and Functional Components</p></li><li><p>How to Use Multiple Context in one single component</p></li><li><p>Hooks Functions(useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext...)</p></li><li><p>Creating Reducer and</p></li><li><p>Using Reducer is going to be clear for you.</p></li><li><p>You'll learn how asynchronous code works in Node and the Node event loop, as well as how to use the event emitter, streams, buffers, pipes, and work with files. </p></li><li><p>We'll see how that leads to building a web server in Node with hands-on examples. </p></li><li><p>The logic behind MongoDB’s data storage</p></li><li><p>The most popular Object Data Modeling Library for MongoDB, Mongoose JS</p></li><li><p>Writing queries for creating, reading, updating, and deleting operations</p></li><li><p>Advanced Features of MongooseJS</p></li><li><p>The best testing framework for NodeJS, Mocha</p></li><li><p>React Native</p></li><li><p>React js</p></li><li><p>React</p></li><li><p>Mobile and web development with react js &amp; native &amp; angular</p></li><li><p>Angular</p></li><li><p>Reactjs</p></li><li><p>React native web</p></li><li><p>Reactnative</p></li><li><p>React js and react native</p></li><li><p>Mobile-and-web-development-with-react-js-native-angular</p></li><li><p>React native mobile development</p></li><li><p>Angular react</p></li><li><p>Mobile and web development with react js native angular</p></li><li><p>Mobile developer</p></li><li><p>Mobile and web development with react js native angular</p></li><li><p>Web development</p></li><li><p>Mobile development</p></li><li><p>React and angular</p></li><li><p>React free</p></li><li><p>React angular</p></li><li><p>Mobile and web development</p></li><li><p>React native mobile</p></li><li><p>React js and native</p></li><li><p>React native and react js</p></li><li><p>React hooks</p></li><li><p>Angular native</p></li><li><p>React native angular</p></li><li><p>Mobile and web with react and react native</p></li><li><p>full stack web development</p></li><li><p>front end web development</p></li><li><p>full stack</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching. </p><p><strong>OAK Academy</strong> based in <strong>London</strong> is an online <strong>education company</strong>.

It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, \"What can I do to become a better web developer faster?\" The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React.JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><strong>What is React Native?</strong></p><p>Created by Facebook, React Native is an open-source-based mobile application framework that uses only JavaScript, making it capable of supporting both Android and iOS platforms. React, also known as React.js, saves time and effort for developers since they only need one programming language. The Native element allows developers to create JavaScript components to design software programs that run on various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, smart TVs, and laptops. With React Native, developers use the same concepts used in the original React framework to design a rich mobile user interface (UI) for various environments from existing components.</p><p><strong>What careers use React Native?</strong></p><p>Businesses that want to create mobile apps for iOS and Android simultaneously to ensure a seamless rollout need developers with a background in React Native. Careers in mobile app development that rely on React Native can count on professionals who can design and build stunning UIs in multiple platforms since it works hand-in-hand with platforms like Windows and tvOS. React Native developers are also vital to helping iOS, and Android companies update and otherwise modernize their apps with features like push notifications and animation for better effectiveness for mobile app subscribers. Developers with a background in React Native might work in full-stack development, designing and refining web-based games, websites, mobile apps, and more.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and Google Flutter?</strong></p><p>Google Flutter offers developers a UI toolkit that has some similarities to React Native. Flutter also has a native component and compiles web, mobile, and desktop applications from a single collection of source codes. Relying on existing code, Flutter is also a free and open-source framework for developers. Until this point, the two frameworks might sound similar. However, React Native is based on and only uses JavaScript, while Flutter only has a loose connection to the language. Google Flutter primarily uses a new language called Dart. Other differences between the two involve sourcing the tool itself and the installation process, setup and configuration, UI component and development, and community support.</p><p><strong>What is Angular and what are its benefits?</strong></p><p>Angular is an open-source, client-side framework for building single-page websites and desktop and mobile applications. It is a full-featured JavaScript application built on TypeScript, which operates across platforms and keeps code clean and consistent throughout the codebase. Angular is an all-in-one rapid application development platform that allows web pages to render efficiently by minimizing communication with servers. The Angular framework offers end-to-end tooling or routing, state management, and form validation, as well as dependency injection and declarative templates. Angular offers out-of-the-box functionality and easy updating, along with an extensive collection of pre-made components. The TypeScript base includes high-quality code that reduces the burden of debugging and allows multiple developers to collaborate across platforms with minimal disruption and less coding.</p><p><strong>Is learning Angular hard?</strong></p><p>Angular is a complex application that contains multiple libraries and cross-platform functionalities, so it can take some time to learn its many features. Angular’s learning curve depends partly on your previous knowledge of web development and your familiarity with the languages used in the Angular platform. If you’re new to Angular, it’s helpful to have some familiarity with the basics of web design and the essentials of HTML and CSS. It’s also useful to know about the other languages that make up the Angular framework. These include basic HTML and CSS, as well as ECMAScript6, or ES6, a general programming language designed to ensure interoperability of web pages across the Internet. It’s also helpful to understand TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript used to write Angular. Learning Angular is even easier if you’re familiar with JavaScript, which is an implementation of ES6 and Angular’s base language.</p><p><strong>What is Angular used for?</strong></p><p>Developers mainly use Angular to build dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) for web, mobile, and desktop. SPAs are web pages based on a single HTML file that is completely controlled by JavaScript. When an action such as clicking a button happens on the page, the code renders it on the page instantly without sending a new request to the server. TypeScript and Angular’s other tools, including routing, state management, and ROM validation, make SPA creation easy and fast. Its open-source JavaScript framework allows developers to reuse code across multiple platforms. Angular’s component-based architecture simplifies the development workflow, making it possible to design apps for deployment in a wide range of environments and update them without extensive recoding.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Angular and React?</strong></p><p>Angular and React are both rapid application development (RAD) platforms based on JavaScript. Angular is a multilayered framework that runs on Typescript and is compatible with many different code editors. It is a full-featured web development platform that requires no additional libraries. This means Angular can independently carry out a full range of development functions such as data binding, form validation, and dependency injection. First introduced in 2013, React is a JavaScript library managed by Facebook, and it works for both single- and multi-page web applications. React is a framework for UI development that’s smaller and faster than Angular. However, it requires other libraries or modules to provide the full range of Angular’s functions. React is easy to install and use for anyone who already knows JavaScript, and because it operates with a virtual DOM, the browser load reduces. Angular operates with a real DOM, which leads to longer runtimes and slower performance.</p><p><strong>Is Angular free to use and where can I get it?</strong></p><p>Angular has both free and paid options, but the developer doesn’t provide pricing information about its paid version for enterprises and large organizations; this information is only available with a custom quote. Individual users can also obtain Angular for free from the developer site. This open-source software is available under an MIT license granted by Google, which gives permission to use the Angular application for any purpose without limitation. New users can also download a free trial version of Angular from the developer. This version is a ready-made standalone app that contains most key features of the platform, and you can install it on any computer without taking all the steps to create the full Angular environment. The free Angular app allows users to get started by learning Angular’s key features and creating a basic app of their own.</p><p><strong>What careers use Angular?</strong></p><p>Angular is one of the most popular web development platforms in use today. Skills in using Angular can be helpful for several careers in fields related to web design and development. Angular skills are most important for careers in practical web development, including specialties like frontend development, which involves designing client-facing web elements such as visual content, UI and UX development, and general software development. Software engineers and site designers can also benefit from learning Angular. It is a JavaScript application, so it’s also useful for JavaScript developers. It’s also possible to create a career around a specialization in Angular development alone. Angular development specialists can work as consultants or independent contractors with multiple organizations needing web development services.</p><p><strong>What IDE is best for Angular?</strong></p><p>An integrated development environment, or IDE, is a software application that consolidates essential web developer tools in a single graphical interface, which streamlines the development process and promotes consistency across all relevant platforms. Many IDEs now support Angular development projects, and there’s an option for every budget. The best paid IDE for Angular is Angular IDE. It was developed especially for the platform, so it supports all its features. Angular IDE is available as a standalone plugin or with an Eclipse plugin. New users can get a 45-day free trial before purchasing. Visual Studio Code is a general-purpose IDE that supports multiple development platforms, including Angular. This free, open-source IDE from Microsoft includes support for TypeScript code and several downloadable Angular plugins.</p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience. </p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p></li></ul><p><strong> You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now!</p><p> <strong>Full Stack Web Development with ReactJS, React Native, Angular</strong></p><p>We offer&nbsp;<strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Welcome to Mastering MUI: Component Customization!</strong></p><p>Whether you're just starting out with React or Material UI, or you've been using MUI for years, you just found <em>the best, most comprehensive course</em> to deepen your knowledge and expand your skills. <strong>Mastering MUI was created by Zachary Reece, a best-selling MUI instructor of over 20,000 students, <em>who has even contributed to the MUI&nbsp;source code!</em></strong> Buckle up for a deep dive into <strong>the most popular React component library used by some of the biggest tech companies in the world like Spotify, Amazon, NASA, and Netflix!</strong>&nbsp;If you're looking to develop a marketable skillset that can get you into these high-earning positions then a new chapter of your journey starts here.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Material UI&nbsp;(MUI)&nbsp;is</strong> <strong><em>the most popular React component library</em> with</strong> <strong>over 90,000 stars on GitHub!</strong>&nbsp;That's more than any competing libraries - even more than TailwindCSS and Bootstrap. <strong>MUI&nbsp;is so popular because it is so powerful.</strong> If you're still relatively new to React then you may ask - what is a component library? I'm glad you asked!&nbsp;A component library is a collection of pre-built React components for all the most common web elements like sliders, switches, ratings, alerts, and so much more. Every application you build requires these basic components. Instead of building them from scratch every time, using <strong>MUI allows you to start out with an entire suite of these ready-to-go components so you can get going faster and focus on building the new, more interesting parts of your web app!</strong> Learn to let Material UI do the heavy lifting for you with its comprehensive customizable component library with integrated styling, theming, layout, and responsive design systems.</p><p><strong>MUI is not just a simple component library.</strong> What makes it so powerful is the fact that <strong>it comes with an entire ecosystem of tools all integrated together which solve all the most common problems you face when working with a large number of components!</strong> MUI&nbsp;has an amazing built-in <strong>styling system</strong> allowing you to customize your components in any way imaginable to match your own custom designs. To simplify your customizations you can centralize all your most commonly used styles in one convenient place and access them from anywhere using the <strong>theming system!</strong>&nbsp;Anything stored in the theme can easily be accessed in any component which streamlines your styles, reduces redundancy, and makes your code more maintainable to update in the future. MUI&nbsp;also comes with an integrated <strong>layout system</strong> to arrange your components on the screen in a consistent and predictable way using the Grid component. Finally, there is an incredible <strong>responsive design system</strong> built into the components, the layout system, and the styling and theming systems to adapt your styles and layouts to the user's device <strong>ensuring your applications look perfect on every screen size.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This is a truly unique course on Material UI - there's no other course like it!</strong> We will examine <em>every single component</em> in the component library. That includes everything about <em>how each component works</em>, specific use cases for <em>when to use one component over another</em>, the <em>underlying DOM&nbsp;elements</em> that each component renders, and <em>advanced techniques</em> for customizing every little detail of each component (even when it's in different states like disabled or focused). <strong>You'll learn customizations that you can't even find in the MUI&nbsp;documentation!</strong></p><p><strong>Not only will you learn every secret tip and trick to every component, but you'll also learn all the foundational core concepts of Material UI&nbsp;and how to get the most out of all its powerful features.</strong> When you're learning anything new it's so important to start with the basics and develop a rock solid understanding of the core concepts. This builds a strong foundation that you can then build on top of by learning more advanced concepts and techniques in the future - that's exactly what this course delivers!</p><p><strong>The course is also full of quizzes</strong> that test your understanding of the functionality and customization techniques for every component to ensure you're learning all of the most important concepts. <strong>The course ends with a final Mastery Assessment</strong> to put all your knowledge to the test and see if you have really <em>mastered MUI!</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Material UI&nbsp;has started expanding beyond just a component library into an entire ecosystem under MUI.</strong> <strong>This now includes</strong> <strong>Base UI, Joy UI, Material UI, MUI&nbsp;X, and MUI&nbsp;System</strong>. As this ecosystem continues to evolve there's more information to learn, it becomes more difficult for beginners to know where to start, and even seasoned developers have a hard time keeping up with all the changes. <em>That's exactly why Mastering MUI&nbsp;was created. </em>We are dedicated to providing you with the most comprehensive MUI&nbsp;education, broken apart into digestible pieces with a clear structure that sets you up for success with deep understanding and practical skills. <strong>This course is your first step along the road to Mastering MUI!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here are some of the main concepts you're going to be learning from our expert instructor:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Learn to use every single component in Material UI (including all important component props)</p></li><li><p>Customize every single detail of every component to override the default styles</p></li><li><p>Develop an easy and repeatable 5-step system to applying any customization for any component</p></li><li><p>Know when to use one component instead of another similar component (like Box vs Paper)</p></li><li><p>Understand the MUI styling system with the SX prop and all of its powerful features and shorthand syntax</p></li><li><p>Dive even deeper to see the DOM elements rendered by every component using the Component X-Ray</p></li><li><p>Breakdown and build complex layouts with responsive design that adapt to screen size using the Grid component</p></li><li><p>Explore the entire MUI&nbsp;ecosystem and how its evolving beyond just a simple component library</p></li><li><p>Apply global styles that affect every component in your project using the Material UI&nbsp;theming system</p></li><li><p>Use a shortcut to writing your styling selectors using the Component Classes object</p></li><li><p>Practice everything you learn with 13 quizzes, 6 assignments, and 1 final mastery assessment at the end</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>After taking this course you will be completely confident in your ability to use and customize any current or future Material UI&nbsp;components all on your own!&nbsp;You'll be ready to start using MUI&nbsp;to build your own projects with stunning design and simple code. <strong>You'll become the expert that everyone on your team will look to for advice when they're still stuck figuring out how to override some default styles!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Along with <strong>lifetime access to <em>24 HOURS</em>&nbsp;of content, </strong>you'll also find <strong>easy access to support through active Q/A. </strong>You've got nothing to lose - this course comes with a <strong>30-day money-back guarantee </strong>in case you aren't completely satisfied!</p><p><strong>Take the first step along your journey to Mastering MUI today and learn real React skills beyond the basics.</strong></p>",

The most flexible and powerful JavaScript framework that allows us to create a Shopify theme from the future. </p><p>The theme built in this course utilizes the best practices for Shopify themes but adds an innovation piece where it is needed the most. The way we will be building this theme will allow for the best customer experience with the least maintenance. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Vue.js?</strong></p><p>Vue.js is the only framework that allows for the kind of flexibility that is needed when building Shopify themes. We are able to inject Vue.js into the parts of the theme where we need it most and keep it away from where we don't need it. Vue.js is also easy to pick up and start using. There is no extensive setup required and no dependencies. It super lightweight and allows us to easily manage state within our theme.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you ready for a treat? Ready for a fantastic journey with me? In this course, you will get to discover the infinite possibilities of PHP and MySQL. In this course, I will show you how to build an amazing e-commerce store from start to finish. After you complete this course, you should have something solid, awesome, and legit to show off on your CV. <br><br>Here is what we are going to build. First of all, I am going to show you how to build a full authentication system with confirm password functionality and that's after creating our config file. After that, we are going to deal with showing data of products and categories neatly on our website and we are going to create a shop page. Now to the cart system where we are going to implement inserting, updating, showing, and deleting products and that's going to be done using Ajax-JQuery. And then to another hardcore part of this project and that is integrating Paypal inside our app. I am going to show you not to only integrate it but also to pay for your first product using it by setting up buyer and merchant accounts. We will see how these whole PayPal configurations work under the hood and before that, I am going to show how to place your first order by creating the checkout page. The last part of the user's side is to allow the user to see his orders and update his data and I am going to show you how to do this securely. In the second part of this course, we are going to take care of the admin panel where I am going to show you how to deal with admins, categories, products, and orders. Of course, there are going to be a lot of details to talk about. So if you think this course is beneficial to you, go ahead and get it now. See you inside.&nbsp; </p>",

It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, \"What can I do to become a better web developer faster?\" The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React.JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><strong>What is React Native?</strong></p><p>Created by Facebook, React Native is an open-source-based mobile application framework that uses only JavaScript, making it capable of supporting both Android and iOS platforms. React, also known as React.js, saves time and effort for developers since they only need one programming language. The Native element allows developers to create JavaScript components to design software programs that run on various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, smart TVs, and laptops. With React Native, developers use the same concepts used in the original React framework to design a rich mobile user interface (UI) for various environments from existing components.</p><p><strong>What careers use React Native?</strong></p><p>Businesses that want to create mobile apps for iOS and Android simultaneously to ensure a seamless rollout need developers with a background in React Native. Careers in mobile app development that rely on React Native can count on professionals who can design and build stunning UIs in multiple platforms since it works hand-in-hand with platforms like Windows and tvOS. React Native developers are also vital to helping iOS, and Android companies update and otherwise modernize their apps with features like push notifications and animation for better effectiveness for mobile app subscribers. Developers with a background in React Native might work in full-stack development, designing and refining web-based games, websites, mobile apps, and more.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and Google Flutter?</strong></p><p>Google Flutter offers developers a UI toolkit that has some similarities to React Native. Flutter also has a native component and compiles web, mobile, and desktop applications from a single collection of source codes. Relying on existing code, Flutter is also a free and open-source framework for developers. Until this point, the two frameworks might sound similar. However, React Native is based on and only uses JavaScript, while Flutter only has a loose connection to the language. Google Flutter primarily uses a new language called Dart. Other differences between the two involve sourcing the tool itself and the installation process, setup and configuration, UI component and development, and community support.</p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience. </p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions<br></p></li></ul><p><strong> You'll also get:</strong></p><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p><p>Dive in now to our <strong>Complete React Native Course with Router, Hooks and Context </strong>course</p><p>We offer&nbsp;<strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Unlock the World of Laravel:</strong> <strong>NEW Complete Laravel for Beginners to Mastery Bootcamp</strong></p><p>Are you ready to dive into the dynamic world of web development with one of the most powerful PHP frameworks available? Welcome to your immersive journey into Laravel, specifically designed for beginners who are eager to learn and excel. Whether you're just starting out or looking to expand your skills, this guide will take you from the basics of Laravel 10 and 11 to the creation of sophisticated web applications with ease and confidence.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Laravel?</strong></p><p>Laravel stands out as a leading PHP framework due to its elegant syntax, robust feature set, and active community support. It’s not just about building web applications; it's about building them efficiently, securely, and with the potential for scalability. For those new to web development, Laravel offers an excellent starting point with a gentle learning curve, allowing you to gradually build your knowledge and skills.</p><p>Getting Started with Laravel for Beginners</p><p>This guide is crafted with beginners in mind, ensuring that you build a solid foundation in Laravel before moving on to more advanced concepts. We’ll start with the basics—understanding the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, setting up routes, and working with migrations. These essential concepts will serve as your building blocks as you progress.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. MVC Architecture</strong><br>The MVC architecture is at the heart of Laravel, and understanding it is crucial for any web developer. We'll break down each component, showing you how models represent your data, views handle your presentation, and controllers process user inputs and interactions. This structure not only makes your code more organized but also more maintainable.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Routing</strong><br>Routing in Laravel is simple yet powerful. You’ll learn how to define routes, manage controllers, and even create route groups for better organization. This section will help you understand how to direct user requests to the appropriate part of your application.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Migrations</strong><br>Database migrations are a game-changer in Laravel. They allow you to version control your database, making it easy to collaborate with others and roll back changes if needed. You'll get hands-on experience creating and managing migrations, ensuring your database evolves alongside your application.</p><p>Moving to Advanced Laravel Topics</p><p>Once you have a grasp on the fundamentals, it’s time to dive deeper into Laravel’s advanced features. This is where you’ll truly see the power of Laravel and how it can transform your web development workflow.</p><p><strong>1. Eloquent ORM</strong><br>Eloquent ORM is Laravel’s built-in tool for working with databases. It simplifies database operations, allowing you to interact with your database using an intuitive, object-oriented syntax. We’ll cover everything from basic CRUD operations to more complex queries and relationships, giving you the tools to manage your application’s data with ease.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Blade Templating</strong><br>Laravel’s Blade templating engine makes it easy to create dynamic, reusable views. You'll learn how to leverage Blade’s powerful features, such as template inheritance and components, to build scalable and maintainable user interfaces. By the end of this section, you'll be able to create clean and efficient front-end code that integrates seamlessly with your backend.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Authentication</strong><br>Security is a top priority in any web application, and Laravel provides a comprehensive authentication system out of the box. We’ll walk you through setting up user registration, login, password resets, and even more advanced features like two-factor authentication. With Laravel, securing your application is straightforward and hassle-free.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. Package Development</strong><br>One of the most exciting aspects of Laravel is its vibrant ecosystem of packages. You’ll discover how to find, install, and use third-party packages to extend your application’s functionality. Plus, we’ll guide you through the process of creating your own packages, allowing you to share your work with the community or reuse it across multiple projects.</p><p>Hands-On Learning: Real-Time Coding and Projects</p><p>This guide isn't just about learning concepts—it's about applying them in real-time. With hands-on coding examples and projects, you'll put your new skills to the test, building functional web applications as you progress. These practical exercises are designed to reinforce your learning and ensure that you’re not just reading about Laravel, but actually using it to solve real-world problems.</p><p>Mastering Laravel: Beyond the Basics</p><p>As you continue your journey, you'll unlock the true power of Laravel. You’ll explore advanced topics like middleware, queues, and event broadcasting, which allow you to build scalable and high-performing applications. By the end of this guide, you'll have the confidence and skills to tackle even the most complex web development challenges.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why This Course?</strong></p><p>When I set out to create this guide, my goal was simple: to make web development accessible to everyone, especially beginners. I’ve structured each section to build on the last, ensuring that you never feel overwhelmed. The lessons are paced to allow you to absorb and apply new information effectively, making the learning process smooth and enjoyable.</p><p>Imagine diving into development with the confidence that every question you have will be answered as you go along. That’s the experience I’ve aimed to create. Whether it’s demystifying the robust features of Laravel or guiding you through complex coding challenges, this guide is here to support you every step of the way.</p><p>Laravel for Beginners: Setting the Stage for Success</p><p>Laravel is more than just a framework—it’s a tool that empowers you to turn your creative ideas into deployable realities. As you work through this guide, you’ll gain a deep understanding of how to use Laravel to build web applications that are not only functional but also secure and efficient.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Choose Laravel?</strong><br>Laravel makes it incredibly easy to integrate JavaScript, CSS, and other tools with just a few lines of code. It’s a framework that simplifies complex tasks, allowing you to focus on what really matters: building great applications.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Community and Support</strong><br>Laravel has an active and welcoming community, which means you’re never alone in your learning journey. Whether you’re looking for advice, feedback, or collaboration opportunities, there’s a whole community of developers ready to help.</p><p>Conclusion: Start Your Laravel Journey Today</p><p><strong>With a 30-day money-back guarantee</strong>, there’s no risk in starting your Laravel journey today.

  "description": "<p><strong>Do you want to be able to test your code and thus become a better programmer?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Welcome to the very <strong>comprehensive</strong> <strong>PHPUnit</strong> (testing framework for PHP) and Selenium for PHPUnit course. <strong>PHPUnit</strong> is a tool for testing code written in <strong>PHP</strong> language. And <strong>Selenium</strong> is a tool for automating web browsers that we will use in this course to test application interfaces. You will learn not only about unit tests but also what integration, functional and acceptance tests are. Particular emphasis will be placed on php unit testing.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Code testing is very important. Here there are most important benefits: </strong></p><ul><li><p>you don't waste time as a web developer for manual testing in a web browser</p></li><li><p>you find mistakes in the code faster</p></li><li><p>what's more, by mastering PHPUnit you will start to write code that is testable (you will learn in the course what is non-testable code!)</p></li><li><p>and your code will be easier to maintain, i.e. it will be easier to adapt it to the changes you might need</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>In short: if you haven't known PHPUnit yet, you'll simply be <strong>a</strong> <strong>better PHP programmer</strong> after completing this course. <strong>PHPUnit</strong> is a very important skill and if you're looking for a job as a PHP developer, it will allow you to increase your chances to get hired.</p><p><br></p><p>During the course, we will be discussing the most important aspects of <strong>PHPUnit</strong> and <strong>Selenium</strong> for PHPUnit on practical examples with hands-on coding, such as assertions, data providers, mocks and others (see the curriculum for more information). You will also learn how to test api clients.</p><p><br></p><p>The most interesting part of this course is building from scratch a real MVC-based application in <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>PHPUnit</strong> using TDD - <strong>Test Driven Development</strong> approach. This is an application for managing product multi-level categories - which is not easy to implement. PHPUnit will be particularly useful here. It will be a very comprehensive TDD - not only unit tests but we will also test the user interface of this application using Selenium WebDriver. The HTML template of this application built using the Zurb Foundation Framework will be available to download (not because I think it is the best, just the template for this particular application was easiest to build using Zurb). We will be coding the backend from scratch using Slim Microframework for PHP. We will also use a great package from Laravel called illuminate/database for Laravel Eloquent ORM, thanks to which database operations are very easy.</p><p><br></p><p>To better consolidate the acquired knowledge the course includes, in addition to lectures, coding exercises, quizzes, assignments and other <strong>practical activities</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>For each lecture that requires coding, there are file resources that you can download and copy &amp; paste, but I encourage you to write code from the screen.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>I promise</strong> that you'll be <strong>a better PHP developer</strong> after completing this PHPUnit course. And even if for some reason you will not like this course, Udemy always offers you a 30-day money back guarantee. But I doubt that you will not like it. I am 100% sure that you will be happy with this course and your <strong>PHP code will be better</strong> from now!</p>",

But in this advanced course, we start building projects together and from Section 4 we start digging into advanced concepts like Basic Auth, CORS and servers.</p><p><strong>Knowing&nbsp; advanced AJAX concepts is crucial if you want to become a serious fullstack developer</strong>, as it will allow you to make asynchronous HTTP requests and listen for incoming data from servers. AJAX can get tricky at times, and I don’t dispute this, but with correct training which includes explaining difficult concepts in a simple way, you will, like me, learn to master and love AJAX.</p><p><strong>What is AJAX in one sentence</strong></p><p>AJAX allows your users to add/delete/view/update content, post comments, submit reviews, submit forms and a ton more, without a page refresh.</p><p><strong>Learn the (advanced) secrets of AJAX in this course</strong></p><p>Understanding the fundamentals of AJAX is important. That's why I created the first part <strong>AJAX&nbsp;Fundamentals</strong> course.&nbsp;I assume that you have either (1)&nbsp;done my AJAX&nbsp;Fundamentals course, or (2)&nbsp;at the very least you've heard of AJAX&nbsp;and know about the XHR object and the Fetch API.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>This AJAX&nbsp;EXPERT&nbsp;COURSE&nbsp;is important, because it goes beyond the fundamentals of AJAX. It allows you to use AJAX to its fullest to advantage you best. It allows you to master AJAX and take your skills to the next level.</strong></p><p>It will equip you to become a highly sought-after programmer. </p><ul><li><p>Learn how to send authentication information using the XHR&nbsp;object and the Fetch API</p></li><li><p>Learn how to take user inputs, convert it into JSON data, and send that data to a server</p></li><li><p>Learn how to retrieve XML, JSON and text data from a server</p></li><li><p>Learn how to take data from server and update the page dynamically using JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Learn how to write great code using modules, writing middleware and defining RESTful AJAX APIs, and more!</p></li></ul><p><strong>Delivering an interactive, asynchronous web experience is challenging.</strong> In this AJAX&nbsp;BEYOND&nbsp;FUNDAMENTALS course, we take a deep-dive into AJAX. Together, we will tackle questions like:&nbsp;How can you use Basic HTTP Authentication with AJAX? What do you do if you get a CORS issue using AJAX? What happens when an AJAX request reaches a server? What are RESTful APIs and how do you set them up? <strong>Answering these questions with confidence will propel you to being confident in AJAX and able to maximize performance.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHAT&nbsp;THIS&nbsp;AAJX&nbsp;COURSE&nbsp;COVERS?</strong></p><p><strong>This course is best done if you have at least a little understanding of AJAX.</strong></p><p>If you have never heard of AJAX, I encourage you to first do my <em>AJAX Fundamentals </em>course. The reason I have done this is that my AJAX Fundamentals course provides everything you need to start using AJAX yourself. It gives you the sound fundamentals and practicals regarding AJAX. It will take you to the point where you will understand where AJAX came from, how to set up an AJAX request using the XHR object and the modern Fetch API.</p><p><strong>THIS&nbsp;AJAX&nbsp;EXPERTS&nbsp;COURSE picks up on my AJAX Fundamentals course<em> </em>and goes further by digging into topics that are more advanced.</strong> My AJAX BEYOND FUNDAMENTALS<strong><em> </em></strong>course<strong> </strong>will captivate you with real life examples and catapult you to the next level and set you well on your way to achieving everything you want to with AJAX.</p><p><strong>What you will learn:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Understand how to use the XHR, Fetch API and Axios to make an AJAX request</p></li><li><p>How to set up Basic HTTP Auth using Apache, PHP and Node</p></li><li><p>How to solve CORS issues</p></li><li><p>How to define your own AJAX library</p></li><li><p>How to use Modules (ES Modules and CommonJS modules)</p></li><li><p>How to build an entire application that makes RESTful AJAX requests</p></li><li><p>How to use middleware (like cors(), express.urlencoded()&nbsp;and express.json())&nbsp;on your server</p></li><li><p>How to set up Routes on your server and send responses back to a browser</p></li><li><p>How to become a better frontend programmer</p></li><li><p>And more!</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>In my <em>AJAX BEYOND FUNDAMENTALS</em> course you’ll learn, in a simple and fun way, about Basic Auth, CORS, SOP, RESTful services, server routes, middleware, modules, and a ton more!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>END GOAL OF THIS COURSE</strong></p><p>You will be confident in AJAX and together we build a fully functional site that performs basic CRUD operations and saves data to a server. This simple application will use the power of RESTful AJAX APIs to speak to a server and perform tasks like adding/deleting/updating and viewing data that is stored on your server. </p><p>In building this application you will learn the following:</p><ul><li><p>Set up a server to store all of your data</p></li><li><p>The server will be set up on a different port number than your frontend code</p></li><li><p>You will have to solve CORS errors</p></li><li><p>Listen for the DOMContentLoaded event to send an AJAX request to populate your table data</p></li><li><p>The users will be able to perform all CRUD operations (create/read/update/delete dog data)</p></li><li><p>All your AJAX code will be written in a module and will be RESTful compliant</p></li><li><p>And a ton more!</p></li></ul><p>How amazing is that?</p><p>By the end of this <strong>AJAX BEYOND FUNDAMENTALS </strong>course, you'll be able to “speak” and “walk” AJAX by gaining an understanding of how you can use it in meaningful and practical ways. We dig deeper in every lecture, and this course has a lot of additional content that will extend your knowledge base and test your skills.</p><p>Through practical examples, I help you understand AJAX piece by piece. And together we use the latest and best features of JavaScript and browsers along the way so you can confidently create what you like using AJAX and stay ahead of the pack.</p><p><strong><em>*** One of the most advanced AJAX courses on Udemy ***</em></strong></p><p>Successful programmers know more than the basics of AJAX. They also know how to solve CORS issues, how to implement authentication and how to set up servers . If you’re wanting to become a full stack developer, you need to know how to send JSON to a server via AJAX (i.e you need to know how to convert your JS&nbsp;objects to JSON), how to define modules and how to use the response data to update the page dynamically. You need to master CORS, and how to allow cross-domain requests, and more! Side by side I take you through all you need to know.</p><p>I want you to gain maximum benefit from this AJAX&nbsp;course<em>, and I am here to help</em></p><p>I want you to be able to easily apply what I teach you in this course to any webpage or challenge of your choosing.</p><p>If AJAX is your interest, this course is perfect for you my dear student.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How is this course <em>different</em>?</strong></p><p>There are lots of great courses that focus on web development. But they never get into the detail about AJAX related issues that will pop up when you start creating more complex sites.</p><p>In this AJAX&nbsp;BEYOND&nbsp;FUNDAMENTALS course, I focus on the more advanced topics of AJAX. This includes understanding why the XHR object allowed a username and password field, why you will sometimes want your frontend running a port number that is different to the server port, how to set up a server, how to implement Basic Auth, how to utilize the power of Modules, and more!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Practice makes perfect</strong></p><p>Theory is theory … but there’s nothing like the real McCoy and getting behind your computer and typing in good code. That’s why we will be coding, laughing and pulling out our hair together as we code real life websites and exercises during this course. From Section 2 and beyond we start building AJAX&nbsp;projects together. </p><p>I love doing practical examples with my students, which is why this course has a number of them. My practical examples offer great lasting benefit to students and that is why I advocate them. My final course project that we will build together is a highlight, it is an application giving a user the ability to add, update, delete and fetch data from a server. </p><p>How much fun isn’t that?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is This Course Right for You?</strong></p><p>This course is perfect for anyone interested in enhancing their web development skills. If you find yourself in any of these categories, you’ll benefit greatly from this course:</p><ul><li><p>You want to deepen your understanding of asynchronous programming.</p></li><li><p>You’re eager to learn how successful developers build dynamic web applications.</p></li><li><p>You wish to explore advanced concepts like CORS and RESTful APIs.</p></li><li><p>You’re looking for hands-on experience with real-world projects.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>WHY START NOW?</strong></p><p>The demand for skilled web developers is growing rapidly. By mastering AJAX today, you'll position yourself ahead of the competition. This course offers memorable learning experiences, actionable insights, and practical examples that will empower you in your development journey.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What do you get?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime access to all tutorial videos.</p></li><li><p>No fees or monthly subscriptions.</p></li><li><p>Q&amp;A support.</p></li><li><p>Quizzes and challenges to help you learn.</p></li><li><p>I’ve allowed you to download all of my lectures for offline viewing.</p></li></ul><p>Let's get excited about becoming a professional web developer, and to be able to confidently apply it to your own websites.</p><p><strong>See you in the lectures.</strong></p><p><strong>Let's get crackin'</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Hugo</strong> is a super fast&nbsp;static site generator that's here to save you time and make your site <strong>fast</strong>, <strong>secure</strong>, and <strong>inexpensive</strong> to&nbsp;host. There's just one catch, your current website is already on WordPress™. This course will guide you through safely migrating your site and your workflow&nbsp;from WordPress to Hugo.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Some of the earlier course content is out of date, because Hugo has continued to advance since I started creating this course a few years ago. There is still a TON&nbsp;of great content here, but a little \"elbow grease\" may be required to get things working on your machine.</p><p><strong>NOTE2: I don't have time to finish and update this course.&nbsp; :'(&nbsp; If you are an experienced course content creator and would like to take over the superhero cape, reach out to me on LinkedIn.</strong></p><p><em>Background</em>:</p><p>WordPress is the most popular website management system in the world. And with good reason: it's easy to get up and running, and there is a rich ecosystem of beautiful&nbsp;themes and feature-enhancing plugins.&nbsp;</p><p>However, (<em>queue the eerie mood music</em>), <strong>WordPress has is faults...</strong></p><ul><li><p>Every year, <strong>security vulnerabilities</strong> are discovered in WordPress and its&nbsp;underlying programming&nbsp;language, PHP.</p></li><li><p>Content is served dynamically, so <strong>site performance suffers</strong>. Getting a solid PageSpeed ranking&nbsp;requires lots of&nbsp;of time,&nbsp;plugins, and&nbsp;hacks.</p></li><li><p>Good hosting options can be quite <strong>expensive</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Its&nbsp;database back-end&nbsp;limits hosting options and complicates backup&nbsp;and recovery.</p></li></ul><p>But here's a secret you probably already know:&nbsp;Today, the vast majority of sites <strong>don't need to be on WordPress</strong>. Most sites serve static, or unchanging, content. For example, I'm doing good if I can publish to my blog once a month or so. So why was I&nbsp;using a Content Management System (CMS) like WordPress? In my case, I didn't want to have to write my posts as HTML, upload them over FTP, update index pages to include my new post, manually add pagination, headers, footers, format images, etc. WordPress automated all of this. For the most part, all I had to do was focus on the content; WordPress took care of the rest. It was glorious!</p><p>That was the early 2000s. Nowadays we have <strong>static site generators</strong> like <strong>Hugo</strong>! With Hugo, I just&nbsp;write my blog post.&nbsp;Then Hugo generates my entire site, including all of those updated&nbsp;links, headers, footers, even a sitemap. And get this: it does it in about&nbsp;<em>1 second</em>. Then, with a single command I can push my updated site to a service like Netlify, and my new post is live within a few minutes.<br></p><p><strong>With Hugo, you get</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Ultra-fast site generation</p></li><li><p>Free hosting options</p></li><li><p>More security because there is no database or run-time to hack</p></li><li><p>Static pages are faster to serve and easy to cache. A faster site means better SEO.</p></li><li><p>Backups are essentially unnecessary if you store your repo on GitHub or GitLab.</p></li><li><p>Change tracking comes for&nbsp;free if you store your site in a Git repo.</p></li></ul><p>Of course, for long-time WordPress users like myself,&nbsp;a number of <strong>questions come up</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>What about my SEO&nbsp;plugin (yoast)? (<strong>Coming</strong>)</p></li><li><p>What about my&nbsp;syntax highlighting plugin&nbsp;(for tech blogs)? (<strong>Coming</strong>)</p></li><li><p>What about my comments!? (<strong>Coming</strong>)</p></li><li><p>What about my cool theme? Can I port it Hugo? (<strong>In progress</strong>)</p></li><li><p>What about help with spelling, grammar, writing&nbsp;style? (<strong>Coming</strong>)</p></li><li><p>What about advanced plugins for asset bundling, minification, etc? (<strong>In progress</strong>)</p></li></ul><p>Learn all this and more with this comprehensive course. Enjoy!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>What is GraphQL?</strong></p><p>GraphQL is a query language for your API and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is backed by your existing code and data.</p><p><strong>What is Apollo?</strong></p><p>Apollo is the industry-standard GraphQL implementation, providing the data graph layer that connects modern apps to the cloud. Apollo will handle data fetching, caching, and state management of out the box!</p><p><strong>What is&nbsp;Next.js?</strong></p><p>Next.js is React framework that provides infrastructure and simple development experience for server-side rendered(SSR) applications.</p><ul><li><p>An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)</p></li><li><p>Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis</p></li></ul><p><strong>What are we going to build?</strong></p><p>We will work mainly on portfolios features. You will learn how to manage client and server data with Apollo and Graphql. Data will be stored in Mongo Atlas Database, to which we will be communicating through the Node JS Server. We will create functionality to create a portfolio, and I will explain how to manage forms efficiently. Then we will look at an update functionality where I will show you how to populate inputs with existing data. After that, works on a delete functionality. All of the features will be reactive and updating views in real-time. You will learn the basics of data fetching and data mutations with Apollo.</p><p>Another significant feature we will be working on will be session-based authentication. We will prepare login and register forms. Users will register, login, and experience features only for authenticated users. You will learn how to manage sessions, protect the pages, and organize an authentication state through your application.</p><p>The forum feature will be the biggest one. You will learn how to create a fully working forum consisting of topics and posts. We will integrate a component used for topic and posts creation. Users will be able to develop various topics, posts, and replies to other posts, all updated in real-time and across the browsers. After that, you will learn how to create a fully working pagination!</p><p>Later in the course, we will create features to get randomized data for the home page, and I will talk about re-usability. We will finish the CV page, and we will get into deploying. After all production improvements are applied, we will deploy our application to Heroku so anyone on the internet can access our portfolio.</p>",

  "description": "<p>My main goal is to <strong>help you understand and master Parcel web application bundler</strong>. This course was specifically designed for those who want to learn Parcel bundler from scratch or improve their current knowledge in this topic. <strong>At the moment this course covers Parcel v1.</strong></p><p>In this course we will build fully functional todo list application from scratch. Along the way we will learn and apply various Parcel features to this application. We will start from the very basics and then gradually move towards more advanced topics like <strong>tree shaking, code splitting and lazy loading</strong>. Large portion of this course is dedicated to optimizing your applications in production. You will learn how to optimize large images, remove unused CSS, and compress your resulting bundles with gzip and brotli.</p><p>We will also cover Parcel integrations with popular JavaScript libraries like React, Vue, jQuery, Bootstrap etc. Each lesson builds on top of the previous ones, so it is easy to follow.

And then we are going to build a full authentication system from scratch. While building this system I am going to introduce you to hashing and dehashing passwords. And then, we are going to build general and cool features inside our own app. We are going to build the topics system. And in this section, I am going to show you how to create, update, show, and delete topics in an easy manner. And now that every topic has a reply we are going to build the replies system so users will be allowed to create and update and delete their own replies. After all of this, we are going to move to other parts of the forum and they are general parts that are related to categories, topics, and replies. Also, there is a section where we are going to take care of the profile system. And then we will dive deeper into creating the admin panel. There is a lot to talk about, but I don't want to make this description too long. So if you like this course, get it right now!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

It runs on your visitor's computer and doesn't require constant downloads from your website. JavaScript is often used to create polls, validation and quizzes.</p><p>JavaScript was originally developed in 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, while he was working for Netscape Communications Corporation. Indeed, while competing with Microsoft for user adoption of web technologies and platforms, Netscape considered their client-server offering a distributed OS with a portable version of Sun Microsystems' Java providing an environment in which applets could be run.[citation needed] Because Java was a competitor of C++ and aimed at professional programmers, Netscape also wanted a lightweight interpreted language that would complement Java by appealing to nonprofessional programmers, like Microsoft's Visual Basic.<br></p><p><strong>What you will learn in this course?:</strong></p><ul><li>Basic fundamentals from scratch (covers everything from scratch)</li><li>JavaScript Objects</li><li>JavaScript Error Handling</li><li>validations</li><li>Debugging</li><li>Multimedia</li><li>Image map</li><li>Animation</li></ul><p>And many more with examples replicating real time scenarios..</p><p>Additional Topics will be added regularly</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>HTML5 Games</strong> run on just about all devices. Learn how to create them from someone who has spent the last 20 years creating casual games. All HTML5 games are based around a knowledge of displaying content on a Canvas using JavaScript. We use the latest JavaScript version, ES6, so as well as learning game development you will also learn the latest JavaScript syntax. In this course we start with the basics of individual images on a Canvas. From there we move onto sprites - developing step by step a <strong>sprite library</strong> that you are <strong>free to use in your own games</strong>. The library allows you to display frame animated sprites that show a flip book of images to display walking and running characters and much more.&nbsp;</p><p>You will learn:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>About physics to <strong>easily</strong>&nbsp;add dynamic collision detection to your games.</p></li><li><p>How to create <strong>platform games, puzzle </strong>and<strong> card</strong>&nbsp;games.</p></li><li><p>How to add multiple layers of audio.</p></li><li><p>How to add a preloader to your games.</p></li><li><p>How to add the <strong>bells and whistles</strong> that make your game stand out.</p></li><li><p>How to handle multiple users via WebSockets.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>All <strong>code is free</strong> to use in your own games. The course contains lots of assets and code examples that you are free to use in your own games. As a course student you also have access to an <strong>online tool</strong> for creating spritesheets and animations.&nbsp;</p><p>Having completed this course you will be ready to develop any 2d game. Only a basic knowledge of HTML and Javascript are assumed, all ideas are explained with examples you can try and <strong>resources you can use in your own games</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Take a look at the trailer to see the kind of content that you will be building once you've studied the course. HTML5 Game Development is great fun to learn and the skills you learn in this course will greatly improve your JavaScript skills which will be useful in your <strong>Web Development career</strong>.</p><p>Student reviews</p><ul><li><p>“<strong>Great Course!!! </strong>I am learning so much. Nicholas is very good at presenting a concept explaining it and then implementing it into code all the while, allowing me the student to code along addressing any nuances that may be there. He is also <strong>very responsive to any questions</strong>. I know that enrolling into this course was a great decision and I already have the confidence to begin planning and developing my first game”</p></li><li><p>\"If you're looking for the stepping stones to becoming a Game Developer with HTML5, this is the best starting stone you could possibly find. <strong>Love this course!!</strong>\"</p></li><li><p>\"This is the first game development course I have been through where I really feel like I am being <strong>taught by an absolute expert/professional in the field</strong>.\"</p></li><li><p>\"I am currently taking a gaming class in college and this course so far has been able to help me understand what the professor was doing as they expected you to know just a proper setup which I didn't, and this course <strong>brought me up to speed very quickly</strong> by just doing the initial setup.\"</p></li></ul>",

developers expertise Questions sent by students to our instructors are answered by our instructors within <strong>48 hours at the latest</strong></p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM) These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML React Native uses React to build mobile applications Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application With this in mind, React is a library It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning There are a couple of reasons The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job This alone is another reason it is worth learning Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different In React, web components are generated In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs If your focus is web development, then you should learn React If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular One reason is that Facebook developed it The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs) React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements</p><p><strong>What is Node Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time By using JavaScript, node Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux) Node js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast Examples of applications that use node Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node Js?</strong></p><p>Node Js is open-source, meaning it’s free code for all developers On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node Js environment continues to be enhanced Because Node Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training Node Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run) Node Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required Because Node Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies</p><p><strong><em>Fresh Content</em></strong></p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate New tools are released every day, and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge for being a better React developer You will always have up-to-date content for this course at <strong>no extra charge</strong></p><p><em>The instructor helped me whenever I needed it, and I've learned a lot in very little time Now I can create simple single-page applications, and I fell in love with CodePen and VS Code!</em></p><p><em>If you are wanting to learn how to; build for production, push to production, have a dev and production version, and learn how to navigate the two, this is the class for you!

  "description": "<p>In this course you will learn very popular programming languages like JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS and NodeJS\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>JavaScript is a programming language that can be run by all modern web browsers. It is downloaded alongside the HTML code of a webpage. Unlike HTML, which can only be used to display content, JavaScript allows web designers to add functionality and interactivity to their websites.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>JQuery is a popular JavaScript library that is used extensively in modern websites. This library facilitates common JavaScript tasks such as animations, event handling, manipulating HTML content, and communication with external servers. In addition to its easy-to-use features, JQuery also takes care of many cross-browser compatibility issues automatically.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>AngularJS is basically a JavaScript framework (an open source web application framework) library, which is distributed as JavaScript file. Mainly used in developing Single Page Application (SPA). It extendes HTML with additional new attributes hence making simple development and making it more responsive at user’s end, since HTML was never design for dynamics views. AngularJS is very easy to understand hence learning it is a fun. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>NodeJs is a powerful JavaScript engine that can be used for a variety of tasks. In this course, we’ll learn the basics of working with NodeJS. We’ll work with the core libraries, but also learn about using npm: the<strong> </strong>Node Package Manager<strong> </strong>to load and work with any third party package that has been developed for NodeJS. We’ll also look at three ways to write and run a simple web server using node. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Course Topics</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<ul><li>JavaScript</li></ul>\n\n<ol><li>Numbers</li><li>Variables</li><li>String</li><li>Arrays</li><li>Functions</li><li>Conditions</li><li>Loops</li><li>Events</li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>jQuery</li></ul>\n\n<ol><li>Selectors</li><li>Events</li><li>Effects</li><li>Animations</li><li>DOM</li><li>Ajax</li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>AngularJS</li></ul>\n\n<ol><li>Expressions</li><li>2 way data handling</li><li>Form submissions</li><li>Filter search</li><li>Form validation</li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>NodeJS</li></ul>\n\n<ol><li>Installtion</li><li>Intro to NPM</li><li>REPL utility</li><li>File input and output</li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br>Prerequisites</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>HTML:<strong> </strong>The student must know how to use HTML tags and attributes. Only a very basic understanding of HTML is assumed.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>Notepad++ (Recommended): Notepad++ is a free, open-source text editor. Although JavaScript and HTML can be written using any text editor, Notepad++ is highly recommended because of features such as syntax highlighting and auto-complete.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Django 4 Masterclass 2022 : Build Web Apps With Django</p><p><strong>Here Is What You Get By Enrolling In This Course:</strong></p><p><strong>Word-By-Word Explanation:</strong> In the entire course, I explain each line of code, without skipping a single line of code.</p><p><strong>Awesome Quality Content:</strong> Over 11+ hours of HD Videos.</p><p><strong>Well Structured &amp; Easy To Learn: </strong>Course has been specially designed to make it easy for the students to learn Django starting from a basic level and gradually moving up to advance concepts.</p><p><strong>24 X 7 Support:</strong> I will always be there to guide you in your journey to become a Django expert.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here Is Everything You Will Learn In This Complete Course:</strong></p><p>In this hands-on course, you will learn how to build complex web applications from scratch using Django.</p><p>The course will teach you Django, right from scratch from a very basic level and will gradually move towards advanced topics like authentication.</p><p>The entire course is divided into 14 major sections.</p><p><strong>Here is a brief description of what you will learn in each section of the course:</strong></p><p><strong>Section 1:</strong> <strong>Introduction and installing required software.</strong></p><p>In this section we will learn what Django is and why it is used. We will also install the tools you will need to start making Django web apps. We will learn how to install Django and setup a Django project both on Windows &amp; Mac individually.</p><p><strong>Section 2:</strong> <strong>Views &amp; URL Patterns</strong></p><p>Django is based on the MVT(Model, Views &amp; Templates) architecture and hence we start learning about what are views, how to create our very first view in Django which will power up our first webpage in Django. We then learn how to attach a view with a URL using URL patterns. We learn what are URL patterns and how they can be used to handle incoming URL requests to our Django app. This view section covers function based views as they are much simpler and offer more functionality, however in the later part of the course we will also learn class based views as well which is another way of implementing views in&nbsp;Django.</p><p><strong>Section 3:</strong> <strong>Database &amp; Models In Django</strong></p><p>After learning about Views and URLs, it's now time to learn about models. In Django models are a blueprint to create database tables. Unlike other backend frameworks, in Django you don't have to create a database connection and then create database tables by writing SQL queries but instead Django provides you with models using which database tables are automatically generated at the backend without having to write a single SQL query. In this section we learn how to create a model and how to map that model to create a database table out of it in the backend.</p><p><strong>Section 4: Django ORM</strong></p><p>Just as you don't have to write SQL queries to create a model, you don't have to write any queries for querying data from the database either. Django comes with a built-in ORM which stands for Object Relational Mapper which allows you to treat database table entries as individual objects. In this section we learn how to add data to database tables using the ORM and also learn how to retrieve data as well from the database using the same. We also learn how to access the Django admin panel by creating a super user from where data could be added by the site administrator. </p><p><strong>Section 5: Views &amp; Templates</strong></p><p>Once we have learned the basics of how views work in Django, we now learn how to populate these views with some database data. We also learn how to connect these views with templates which are nothing but HTML pages rendered dynamically by Django. We also learn how dynamic database data can be injected into these templates by passing context. We also learn how to create detailed views for products and handling hardcoded URLs associated with these detail views.</p><p><strong>Section 6: Adding Styling To Django Project With CSS &amp; Tailwind</strong></p><p>After making a barebones app, we now learn how to style up our Django app. There are multiple CSS frameworks and libraries that can be used for styling apps but the one we will be using is Tailwind CSS. It is one of the most modern ways of styling the webpage. With its utility classes we can style every element of our webpage inline without having to create an external CSS file for it. We will learn how to setup Tailwind for a Django project, how to create a navigation bar with it and also how to stye out Django powered webpages with Tailwind.</p><p><strong>Section 7: Form &amp; CRUD&nbsp;Operations In&nbsp;Django</strong></p><p>Every web application has to perform basic operations like create, read, update &amp; delete data which is also termed as CRUD. In this section we will learn how to design forms in Django so that the end user of our website could perform all these four operations without any issues. Once you learn how to implement CRUD in Django you will be capable of building almost any basic web application in Django.</p><p><strong>Section 8: Authentication</strong></p><p>It important that we limit certain features of our website to registered users and this is exactly what we will be learning in this section. We learn how to register a user to our Django app, how to login a user and how to control access to certain pages and certain actions to just these logged in users. We also learn how to design the logout functionality so that the users could log out of our application. This entire process is called authentication and we will learn how to implement authentication in our Django app.</p><p><strong>Section 9: Creating User Profile</strong></p><p>Every registered user must have their own profile, in this section we will start off by learning how to add a functionality that allows every user to create their own profile. We will then learn how to associate a user with the products which they have posted for selling on our Django web app. This can be done by using relationships and keys between two models. We will connect the user model with the product model so that every product would be associated with a user. We will also create a listing page for every user where they can view all the products listed by them on our web app.</p><p><strong>Section 10: Class Based Views In Django</strong></p><p>We have already learned about the function based view in the earlier part of the course but there is an alternative and a cleaner approach of creating views and that is using class based views. In this section we will re-create every single function based view which is present in our application into a class based view and in the process also learn about the generic views offered by Django such as the ListView, DetailView, CreateView, UpdateView &amp; the DeleteView. we also learn how to add a redirect URL to these views as well.</p><p><strong>Section 11: Customising Admin Panel</strong></p><p>Every Django application we create comes with a built in Admin panel &amp; it provides us with a functionality to customise this admin panel as per our own needs. In this section we will learn how we could modify the admin headers, how to add custom fields to our model in the admin panel, how to add custom search fields and custom actions as well and how to make fields of a model editable inside the admin panel. </p><p><strong>Section 12: Pagination &amp; Search</strong></p><p>Displaying hundreds of products on a single page can be challenging, loading them all on a single page might increase the page load times and here is where pagination comes into picture. Pagination is a process of spreading out items in your database to multiple web pages instead of listing them all on a single page. This ensures a better user experience and quick page load times. In this section we will learn how to implement pagination functionality in our Django application and also implement a search functionality which allows users to search multiple products on our web application.</p><p><strong>Section 13: Payment Gateway Integration With Stripe</strong></p><p>Accepting payments is an integral part of any commercial website, hence in this section we will learn how to integrate stripe payment gateway into our Django app so that end users could pay for products and buy them. We will learn how to create a stipe account, how to add secret keys to our application ,we learn how to design the payment and checkout flow to buy any product on our site and return a payment success view upon successful payment. This payment flow could be integrated into any other Django application which you could create.</p><p><strong>Section 14: Deployment</strong></p><p>This is one of the most interesting part of the course because we will finally be able to deploy our website to the public internet where anyone in the world could access it. We will be using Git &amp; GitHub to initially host our entire project&nbsp; code online and then deploy the same code form GitHub to DigitalOcean app platform. We learn how to create a code pipeline in such a way that code could be deployed from your local code editor, to Git, to GitHub and finally to DigitalOcean app platform. We learn how to set the environment variables to keep our secret app key private and also learn how to host a remote database and then connect it to our deployed Django application. We will also learn how to fix any issues which may arise in the due process.</p><p><br></p><p>So let's begin the journey of becoming a<strong> Django expert.</strong></p><p>In addition to the <strong>Udemy</strong> <strong>30-day money back guarantee</strong>, you have my personal guarantee that you will love what you learn in this course. If you ever have any questions please feel free to message me directly and I will do my best to get back to you as soon as possible!</p><p><br></p><p>Make sure to enrol in the course before the price changes.</p><p>Take yourself one step closer towards becoming a professional Django developer <strong>by clicking the \"take this course button\" now!</strong></p><p>Join the journey.</p><p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p><p><strong>Ashutosh Pawar</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications. <strong>NestJS</strong> is a server-side (backend) application framework beautifully crafted to support developers productivity and make their lives happier. Well, it's not only a framework, it's an enabler of entering the world of advanced engineering concepts such as Domain Driven Design, Event Sourcing, Microservices architecture.</p><p>I spent a good few years in my career developing large scale apps and it didn’t let me down any single time. It’s well written, having quality as an objective, modular web framework with a good documentation, delivering nice developer experience. Exactly the same way I’d describe Nest.</p><p>NestJs is built on the top of Typescript and Express.js. It also combines some elements of Object Oriented Programming and functional programming.</p><p>Here comes NestJS, a framework which is fully written in TypeScript (it supports JS too, but types are good), it’s easily testable and brings in all the necessary stuff you always think about but you don’t know what to choose.</p><p><strong>Why NestJs?</strong></p><p>NestJS doesn’t try to limit you to a particular way of doing things, it just provides the tooling you need. It doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel, it utilize existing tools you already know. For example, it uses express behind the scenes which makes your app compatible with the majority of express middlewares.</p><p>Here are some good reasons why NestJS shines:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Dependency Injection </strong>— NestJS provides DI straight out of the box, increasing efficiency, modularity and testability of applications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Modularisation</strong> — NestJS provides a modular structure for organizing code within the same domain boundary into separate modules.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flexibility</strong> — NestJS provides structure, which helps large teams build complex applications and yet comes in as lightweight as possible, so how you want to build is your choice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Familiar APIs you already know</strong> — NestJS is heavily inspired by Angular, it is also quite similar to much established frameworks like Spring and .NET. This provides a shorter learning curve and lower entry threshold for developers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Community</strong> — NestJS is the fastest rising framework, already with 14K stars surpassing HapiJS. Also, with NestJS leveraging on the <em>Angular way of doing things</em>, things can only get better for the community.</p></li></ul><p>In this course, I will teach you the foundations/fundamentals of NestJs. I will teach you how to build RESTFUL&nbsp;APIs step by step. You will also learn how to plan, design and deploy APIs. I have also another separate section of GraphQL.</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>This course is designed to teach students the foundations of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and React.js. By the end of the course, students will have the skills necessary to build a fully customizable e-commerce site on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. The entire infrastructure will be highly available and scalable using Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) and Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs). <br><br>The course begins by introducing students to AWS and the various services it offers. This includes a brief overview of the AWS management console and how to navigate it. From there, we delve deeper into the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. EC2 will serve as the backbone of the e-commerce site we build using React.JS. Students will learn how to launch and configure EC2 instances, as well as how to connect to them securely using remote connection utilities like PuTTY and Terminal. <br><br>Next, we will cover AWS Storage, including Elastic Block Store (EBS) and Elastic File System (EFS). Here, students learn to create and manage storage volumes, and how to securely connect them to EC2 instances. We also explore the different types of storage available on AWS and when to use each one.<br><br>After covering the basics, students learn to create Elastic Load Balancers and integrate them with Auto Scaling Groups for workload distribution. Here, we demonstrate how to create a highly available and scalable infrastructure for the e-commerce site which will be built in the last section of the course. The infrastructure will automatically scale based on traffic and overall load. Traffic will only be distributed to healthy nodes in the network, based on parameters that are established during configuration. <br><br>Finally, students learn how to build a fully customizable e-commerce site using React.js. Here, students will create and manage a React project, as well as effectively use React components to build a dynamic user interface. We also explore how to integrate the e-commerce site with other AWS services such as AWS storage, to efficiently scale capacity based on application requirements.<br><br>Throughout the course, students will work on hands-on projects to apply the concepts they have learned. These projects include building a simple e-commerce site to start and scaling up to a more complex site with advanced features such as product search, and product categories.<br><br>By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the basics of AWS and React.js. Students will be able to build a fully functional and customizable e-commerce site on an EC2 instance. This includes having the knowledge and skills necessary to continue learning more advanced AWS and React.js concepts and being able to build out new projects independently.<br><br>This course is designed for developers and IT professionals who want to learn how to build scalable and highly available applications on AWS using React.js. No prior experience with AWS or React.js is necessary, but basic understanding of web development and programming concepts is recommended.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Do you want to learn Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)? Perhaps you already have basic knowledge and want to deepen and expand it? <strong>Congratulations!</strong> You are on the right track. </p><p>This course provides the most complete and detailed information on the Scalable Vector Graphics standard of the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) specification. </p><p>Today, 99% of the World Wide Web sites actively use this standard. Take a look at some of <strong>the benefits of SVG:</strong> </p><p>- scales without loss in image quality, which means it is ideal for responsive sites (graphic elements of such sites should be displayed without distortion at any screen resolution);</p><p>- has a small \"weight\" due to the ability to good compression (any site, ideally, should load quickly);</p><p>- supported by all modern browsers (SVG is fully compatible with web technologies and therefore becomes an organic part of sites); </p><p>- easy to use and easy to modify (the format allows you to set the necessary settings for color, shadow, blur and other design effects, both in a graphics editor and on the page itself using CSS, JavaScript); </p><p>- animated and made interactive (adding objects to the digital description of the picture and connecting scripts of the Javascript programming language to them); </p><p>- SVG is a text format, so you can optimize the file for SEO without external meta tags by directly entering keywords into the image code </p><p>And believe me, that's not all! To appreciate all the advantages of SVG, you need <strong>to work with it</strong>. But first, <strong>you should study it! </strong></p><p><br></p><p>A <strong>classic academic learning model</strong> awaits you, allowing you to activate thinking, creativity and create new things. </p><p>In the video lessons of this course, you will become familiar with the theory of Scalable Vector Graphics (language elements, syntax, structure,&nbsp; algorithms, data types). </p><p>All the practical part is attached to the lessons. Here you will find pdf documents summarizing lecture materials as well as homework modules (HTML &amp; CSS files), where specific practical goals will be set for you. You will also find modules with answers (showing one of the possible options for the implementation of the task). </p><p>The academic model of training has proven itself all over the world for a long time and today there is no alternative to it in terms of <strong>the effectiveness of training specialists</strong>. </p><p>Basically, if you are looking for a hands-on course to learn a few tricks using SVG then DON'T take the course. Find the course where the instructor types the code and repeat. Everyone else: <strong>you should take the course, today!</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>Do you want to develop your skills further as a developer? Did you build a couple of projects with PHP and MySQL, but you still think you are inexperienced and you are missing out on a lot of things when coming to developing bigger projects? If yes, then this course is the right resource for you. This course is very digestible and informative and it was created specifically to enhance your coding skills and knowledge not just in PHP and MySQL, but overall in developing web projects. </p><p><br></p><p>Here is what we are going to do in this course. Naturally, we are going to get started by setting up the right tools for our projects. And after that, we are going to build our first simple yet very interesting project and that's a payment page with Paypal. The second project will be about a simple forum system. They are going to be also a couple of generic projects like the full CRUD&nbsp;app and so on. After this, the next project will be the starting of something big because it's an authentication system where I am going to teach you how to develop a login and a register page, how to hash and de-hash passwords, how to do validation and so much more. After this, we are going to build a comments system and this will be the biggest project in this course. We will begin first by doing a post system and then we will grab comments for every post that we have of course we will use Ajax-JQuery for inserting, deleting, and showing comments. after that, we will integrate a rating system into the previous two projects to make a bigger project. So, I will show how to download a JQuery plugin, how to integrate it and how to use it to do the rating system for every post, and so on. And the rating system is going to be implemented of course using Ajax-JQuery. The upcoming project is going to be also created with Ajax and JQuery and that's a live search system and we will combine it with our big project. There are a lot of projects along the way but it's going to take a very long time to talk about them. So I will let you discover the many benefits of this course. If that sounds like something you are interested in, get the course now</p>",

creating a website It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) Frontend code executes on the user's computer This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design <br><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?<br></strong>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website <br><strong>How long does it take to become a Web Developer?<br></strong>The answer to this question will depend on you The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months But good web developers never stop learning A better question might be, \"What can I do to become a better web developer faster?\" The answer to this question is practice Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding <br><strong>What is React?<br></strong>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM) These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications <br><strong>What is React used for?<br></strong>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML React Native uses React to build mobile applications Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware <br><strong>How does React work?<br></strong>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places <br>Is React a framework or library?<br>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application With this in mind, React is a library It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built <br><strong>Is React worth learning?<br></strong>Yes, React is worth learning There are a couple of reasons The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job This alone is another reason it is worth learning Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework <br><strong>Is React hard to learn?<br></strong>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp <br><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?<br></strong>React, or React JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different In React, web components are generated In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs If your focus is web development, then you should learn React If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native <br><strong>Why is React so popular?<br></strong>There are many reasons why React is popular One reason is that Facebook developed it The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs) React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong></p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching</p><p><strong>OAK Academy</strong> based in

  "description": "<p>Django is free, open source and written in Python. </p><p>Django is a Python framework that makes it easier to create dynamic web sites using Python. </p><p>Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template). Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible. </p><p>With Django, you can take web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours. Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. </p><p>Django includes dozens of extras you can use to handle common web development tasks. Django takes care of user authentication, content administration, site maps, RSS feeds, and many more tasks — right out of the box. </p><p>Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking. </p><p>Django user authentication system provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords. Some of the busiest sites on the planet use Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale to meet the heaviest traffic demands. Companies, organizations and governments have used Django to build all sorts of things — from content management systems to social networks to scientific computing platforms.</p><p>This course provides developers with a thorough knowledge in developing Web Applications using Django MVT architectural Pattern.</p><p>In this course by development expert Kameswara Sarma Uppuluri, you'll learn essential concepts that you need to know to build&nbsp;Modern Web Applications using Django 5.0.</p><p>This course provides step-by-step walk-throughs and coding demos that you're encouraged to code along with to enhance the learning process.</p><p>This course is broken down into 39 Modules with each module providing source code so that you can follow along with Kameswara Sarma Uppuluri.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you as fired up as I am? Do you want to build something awesome? Something amazing? Are you a web developer who wants a cool job? If so, then this course is for you. In this course, you will learn how to build a complete booking system from the ground up in a few hours. I already made sure that every part of this course is concise, elegant, and informative, so don't miss out on this cool opportunity. I also included the files needed in different parts of the course for you to follow along with me step by step.</p><p><br><br>Here is what you are going to learn, first of all, I am going to introduce you to the tools that we are going to be using in this course. And then we are going to build a full authentication system from scratch. While building this system I am going to introduce you to hashing and dehashing passwords. And then, we are going to build general and cool features inside our own app. It's going to be mainly on selecting and placing data. The next step is showing how a booking system is created professionally and then we are going to move to one of the most crucial things in this course and that's Processing the payment with Paypal in the easiest yet most efficient way possible. And then, we are going to build a search form to search for booking deals with multiple inputs. After this, we are going to move to the next part and that's the admin panel. In the admin panel, we are going to finish up every part of our website. We are going to complete the admins, countries, cities, and book parts. So it's going to be fun!! Of course, there is a lot to talk about, but this is just a short description of the course. So if you like it, what are waiting for? Get it now!! </p>",

Try it out on Udemy, there's nothing to lose if you don't like it. </p><p><strong>Beginner friendly:</strong></p><p>This course is designed for beginners. You should already know some HTML and a little CSS at this point and that will make learning JavaScript a lot easier. </p><p>JavaScript is nothing like HTML or CSS&nbsp;though because JavaScript is a REAL programming language, whereas HTML and CSS&nbsp;are not programming languages.</p><p><strong>Modern JavaScript included:</strong></p><p>Just because this is a beginner-friendly course doesn't mean you shouldn't learn the ins-and-outs of modern JavaScript. You will learn about modern JavaScript concepts such as:</p><ol><li><p>let/const variables</p></li><li><p>template literals </p></li><li><p>fat arrow functions </p></li><li><p>forEach function-based loops </p></li><li><p>object literals</p></li><li><p>node selectors and query selectors</p></li><li><p>and much more </p></li></ol><p><strong>Practice:</strong></p><p>There is A&nbsp;LOT&nbsp;of practice (hands on coding) in this course. And you'll be writing code from the very first lesson!&nbsp;</p><p>Plus there's a very interactive project at the end of this course. </p><p>In this course you will learn these major concepts:</p><ul><li><p>JavaScript syntax</p></li><li><p>Where to put your JavaScript and how it affects your page </p></li><li><p>How to debug your JavaScript using developer tools (Inspect tools, console logging, and more)</p></li><li><p>Storing variables with var, let, and const JavaScript variable types (Variables)</p></li><li><p>How to tell a computer what to do based on certain circumstances (Conditionals)</p></li><li><p>The Document Object Model (DOM)</p></li><li><p>Making custom sentences with string concatenation and template literals </p></li><li><p>Data types and structures and why they're important (Data structures)</p></li><li><p>How to make lists and take an action on every item in that list (Iteration)</p></li><li><p><strong>How to select elements on your web page and change them </strong></p></li><li><p>Functions, function parameters, and how to use JavaScript rests</p></li></ul><p><strong>Final Project:</strong></p><p>Lastly, there's a final project that will make use of almost everything you will have learned in this course. </p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><p>To start learning JavaScript you should know a little HTML and CSS. These aren't <strong>hard</strong> requirements, but I&nbsp;strongly suggest knowing the basics of HTML and CSS before learning JavaScript. </p><p>JavaScript is how you make your page interactive, so you'll need to know how to make a basic webpage first. </p><ul><li><p>Basic HTML</p></li><li><p>Basic CSS&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Who is JavaScript 101 for?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you've never written any JavaScript in your life, <strong>this course is for you.</strong> </p><p>If you just finished learning HTML and CSS, <strong>this course is for you. </strong></p><p>If you want to learn modern JavaScript in an easy way, <strong>this course is for you. </strong></p><p>If you want lots of hands on practice writing JavaScript, <strong>this course is for you. </strong></p><p>––</p><p>If you already know JavaScript, <strong>this course is NOT for you. </strong></p><p>If you know about features such as fat arrow functions and object literals, <strong>this course is NOT&nbsp;for you. </strong></p><p>If you already know how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript, <strong>this course is NOT for you.</strong></p><p><strong>Testimonials</strong></p><p>I've produced several JavaScript courses with a total of over 80,000 JavaScript students. Here are what some of them have to say about my other courses (and you can trust this course will be even better <strong>because it's new!</strong>)</p><ol><li><p><em>\"Almost there. A lot to learn and Kalob makes it easy and interactive with the video and files. But he also pushed you to try it on your own for homework and mini projects.\"</em></p></li><li><p><em>\"Its a great course! Love the way Kalob teaches, very clear understanding.

  "description": "<p>Welcome to <strong>Complete full stack web development course with Django 3 as backend and ReactJS in front end</strong>. Along with this we will use a <strong>payment gateway </strong>to configure our t-shirt selling store.</p><p>Full Stack web development is really high in demand and in this course, we are bringing 2 of the most popular programming languages together, <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. We will start by installing python and a virtual environment. After that we will install Django and will work on backend. We are using a scalable approach of dividing project into multiple Django apps. Further we will create API from our backend so that in future you can modify front end without any issues. Django development is very fast and you will quickly realise it.</p><p><br></p><p>We will use core Django framework as well as Django <strong>REST</strong> framework to create backend <strong>API</strong>. We will also learn to modify framework so that we can sign up custom user in this application</p><p><br></p><p>Moving to front end, first we will take some crash courses in react, bootstrap and react navigation so that you can come to speed. After that we will create a react project and will structure front end to talk to backend. We will create a modular structure for front end so that in future multiple team can work on front end too. We will learn to create request to multiple URLs of backend and provide authentication to some routes.</p><p>When we sign up and sign in from front end, we will learn <strong>JSON</strong> based request as well as <strong>form data</strong> based request. We will also learn to protect some routes, so that only authenticated users can access it.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally we will also learn to integrate payment gateway both at backend and front end of the application. We will study the documentation of the payment gateway and flow of payments. After that user will be able to place order from our store.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is packed with lots of information and you will enjoy the learn process!</p><p><br></p><p>See you inside the course</p>",

  "description": "<p>You want to learn how to build websites? If answer is yes and If we would say on that, this is a good starting point, it would be cliché, right? But also, that would be even lie because if you want to learn how to build websites this is not good point to start, this is where you need to start. Every website on the internet have been built completely or on some way with HTML. So, learning of&nbsp; HTML is the first step that you need to make if you want to learn how to build websites.</p><p>This course is made for all of you without any previous experience with HTML and for all of you that want to improve your previous, basic knowledge about HTML. We know how tough is to start with learning of something new, so we will not overwhelm you with bunch of other technologies. Something like, you know HTML is cool but do you know what is even more cool than that, to use some JavaScript and jQuery and maybe some Bootstrap! Don’t worry we will not do that. We will do our best in this course to teach you all that you need to learn about HTML. From what is HTML, through how to create HTML documents (web pages), to the how to create complete HTML website from the scratch. Once when you feel comfortable with all that you know about HTML we are sure that you will continue with learning of all that other technologies, but until then we will provide you pure and simple HTML with just basic information about CSS and JavaScript, like why to use it and where to use it in your websites.</p><p>In this course every lesson contains four parts.</p><p>1. In the first part of lesson we’ll introduce you what we going to learn in that lesson.</p><p>2. In the second part we will catch little bit of theory related with that topic.</p><p>3. In the third part we will implement all that in code, in some real-life example.</p><p>4. And in the fourth and the last part of the lesson, we will recap all that we have learned in that lesson.</p><p>Learning of HTML is super easy and super fun and we have done our best to make this course just like that! So, if you are ready to start, we are here for you and we are honored to be the part of this journey with you. For all your questions we will provide answers as soon as possible and we are continuously working on improvement of our materials.</p>",

The ecosystem process includes project bootstrapping, development operations/tools, testing, and build support.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the best features of Angular framework is that it is quite flexible when it comes to usage of external libraries apart from the scalability it provides. With Angular framework adoption being high, performance management of the application is community driven indirectly driving better job opportunities.

  "description": "<p>                Hello and welcome to this course. This course is about AWS Lambda function in C#. So now, for sure, you are wondering what Lambda Functions is and how you can use them. Let me please explain.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the leading cloud provider in the world. It offers more services than any other competitors do and many of these services are connected and easy to use. As the rise of the serverless architecture, the Lambda Functions provide a good point to create a service that can be called and run when needed and execute a certain command. Instead of having to allocate servers for a certain events, Lambda can handle multiple request upon a certain limit instead of adding servers to it.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Lambda functions are easy to create via Visual Studio. Moreover, the people in AWS have a good support for it. You will find it easy to create a certain lambda project and uploading it to the cloud. Also, you only pay for what you use not for hosting. So if you use your function for 200 millisecond (That’s right pricing is per millisecond so cheap!) you will only pay for this amount of time no more.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> Lambda function can be exposed from inside AWS different services such as S3, DynamoDB. In addition, you can connect to it via any .NET application (Console, ASP.NET, etc.). Integration is easy and you will need only to provide your API keys and set the region. You are all set to go to connect to your function and do whatever operation needed for it.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Using C#, you will find it much easier to handle AWS Lambda Functions instead of trying to achieve the same result using other languages. And the NuGet packages for AWS SDK will expose many of the needed functionality for your Lambda Function.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course will cover all the needed steps for you, starting from creating the project until unit testing. We will walk you through the needed steps to make sure that you can create a successful AWS Lambda Function in C#.\n\n</p>",

And then you will be confident in using <strong>ReactJS</strong>, and if you ever get stuck, we will be there to help.</p><p>HTML, or hypertext markup language, is computer code used to create web pages and emails. Web developers, email marketers, web writers, and many others use HTML.</p><p>JavaScript is one of the most ubiquitous programming languages on the planet, mostly because it's the backbone of interactive web applications. On top of that, JavaScript is a great language for beginners because it gives them a chance to write code that does something visual, which is exciting and helpful when you're just getting started as a programmer. Dynamic content is the hot topic in web development right now. Dynamic content refers to content that constantly changes and adapts to specific users whenever possible. For example, JavaScript can be used to determine if a website visitor is using a computer or a mobile device before deciding whether or not to render the mobile version of the website. It's these small things behind the scenes that create genuine value in using JavaScript to create dynamic web pages.</p><p>Angular is one of the most popular frameworks for building client apps with HTML, CSS.

It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, \"What can I do to become a better web developer faster?\" The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What is HTML and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML stands for hyper-text markup language. Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned. Today, HTML is much more complex and dynamic, allowing front-end developers to create any layout or setup they desire.</p><p><strong>Why is CSS and Javascript important for HTML?</strong></p><p>HTML is a formatting language, not a programming language. Javascript is often necessary to make HTML “dynamic.” While HTML can make it so that text is displayed on the screen, Javascript can update this text or make it move. Javascript is used for both front-end and back-end development, hand-in-hand with HTML, to create complex and attractive web designs. Meanwhile, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to organize the look and feel of a website and make the website easier to update and manipulate. Today, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are frequently used to develop responsive web designs — designs that react to a user’s environment for a better user experience.</p><p><strong>What is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)?</strong></p><p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used to style markup language. Markup languages include HTML, XHML, XML, and other XML-based languages. The most common use of CSS is to style HTML web pages. Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it. With CSS, you can target specific elements in a web page and change the look and arrangement on the page. CSS can make an embedded image small or cover the entire webpage as a background. You can enlarge a heading and apply a specific font to stand out from the rest of the page. Other things you can do with CSS include changing the color of elements, making elements float to one side of the page, and the list goes on. Every web page uses HTML, and every web page that has its unique look uses CSS.</p><p><strong>What careers use CSS?</strong></p><p>CSS applies to any career that involves web development. Web designers create the templates, mockups, and styles for a website using HTML and CSS that web developers use to build websites. Front-end web developers use CSS with HTML and JavaScript to build front-end web applications that run in the browser. Fullstack web developers create both the part of a web application that runs in the browser and on the server and need to know CSS to make the front-end look good. Content managers may need to know CSS to apply custom styles to articles they publish through a content management system like WordPress. Other job titles that may require you to know CSS include junior web developer, social media manager, website editor, content editor, website project manager, website support specialist, and webmaster.</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React.JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><strong>What is React Native?</strong></p><p>Created by Facebook, React Native is an open-source-based mobile application framework that uses only JavaScript, making it capable of supporting both Android and iOS platforms. React, also known as React.js, saves time and effort for developers since they only need one programming language. The Native element allows developers to create JavaScript components to design software programs that run on various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, smart TVs, and laptops. With React Native, developers use the same concepts used in the original React framework to design a rich mobile user interface (UI) for various environments from existing components.</p><p><strong>What careers use React Native?</strong></p><p>Businesses that want to create mobile apps for iOS and Android simultaneously to ensure a seamless rollout need developers with a background in React Native. Careers in mobile app development that rely on React Native can count on professionals who can design and build stunning UIs in multiple platforms since it works hand-in-hand with platforms like Windows and tvOS. React Native developers are also vital to helping iOS, and Android companies update and otherwise modernize their apps with features like push notifications and animation for better effectiveness for mobile app subscribers. Developers with a background in React Native might work in full-stack development, designing and refining web-based games, websites, mobile apps, and more.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and Google Flutter?</strong></p><p>Google Flutter offers developers a UI toolkit that has some similarities to React Native. Flutter also has a native component and compiles web, mobile, and desktop applications from a single collection of source codes. Relying on existing code, Flutter is also a free and open-source framework for developers. Until this point, the two frameworks might sound similar. However, React Native is based on and only uses JavaScript, while Flutter only has a loose connection to the language. Google Flutter primarily uses a new language called Dart. Other differences between the two involve sourcing the tool itself and the installation process, setup and configuration, UI component and development, and community support.</p><p><strong>What is Angular and what are its benefits?</strong></p><p>Angular is an open-source, client-side framework for building single-page websites and desktop and mobile applications. It is a full-featured JavaScript application built on TypeScript, which operates across platforms and keeps code clean and consistent throughout the codebase. Angular is an all-in-one rapid application development platform that allows web pages to render efficiently by minimizing communication with servers. The Angular framework offers end-to-end tooling or routing, state management, and form validation, as well as dependency injection and declarative templates. Angular offers out-of-the-box functionality and easy updating, along with an extensive collection of pre-made components. The TypeScript base includes high-quality code that reduces the burden of debugging and allows multiple developers to collaborate across platforms with minimal disruption and less coding.</p><p><strong>Is learning Angular hard?</strong></p><p>Angular is a complex application that contains multiple libraries and cross-platform functionalities, so it can take some time to learn its many features. Angular’s learning curve depends partly on your previous knowledge of web development and your familiarity with the languages used in the Angular platform. If you’re new to Angular, it’s helpful to have some familiarity with the basics of web design and the essentials of HTML and CSS. It’s also useful to know about the other languages that make up the Angular framework. These include basic HTML and CSS, as well as ECMAScript6, or ES6, a general programming language designed to ensure interoperability of web pages across the Internet. It’s also helpful to understand TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript used to write Angular. Learning Angular is even easier if you’re familiar with JavaScript, which is an implementation of ES6 and Angular’s base language.</p><p><strong>What is Angular used for?</strong></p><p>Developers mainly use Angular to build dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) for web, mobile, and desktop. SPAs are web pages based on a single HTML file that is completely controlled by JavaScript. When an action such as clicking a button happens on the page, the code renders it on the page instantly without sending a new request to the server. TypeScript and Angular’s other tools, including routing, state management, and ROM validation, make SPA creation easy and fast. Its open-source JavaScript framework allows developers to reuse code across multiple platforms. Angular’s component-based architecture simplifies the development workflow, making it possible to design apps for deployment in a wide range of environments and update them without extensive recoding.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Angular and React?</strong></p><p>Angular and React are both rapid application development (RAD) platforms based on JavaScript. Angular is a multilayered framework that runs on Typescript and is compatible with many different code editors. It is a full-featured web development platform that requires no additional libraries. This means Angular can independently carry out a full range of development functions such as data binding, form validation, and dependency injection. First introduced in 2013, React is a JavaScript library managed by Facebook, and it works for both single- and multi-page web applications. React is a framework for UI development that’s smaller and faster than Angular. However, it requires other libraries or modules to provide the full range of Angular’s functions. React is easy to install and use for anyone who already knows JavaScript, and because it operates with a virtual DOM, the browser load reduces. Angular operates with a real DOM, which leads to longer runtimes and slower performance.</p><p><strong>Is Angular free to use and where can I get it?</strong></p><p>Angular has both free and paid options, but the developer doesn’t provide pricing information about its paid version for enterprises and large organizations; this information is only available with a custom quote. Individual users can also obtain Angular for free from the developer site. This open-source software is available under an MIT license granted by Google, which gives permission to use the Angular application for any purpose without limitation. New users can also download a free trial version of Angular from the developer. This version is a ready-made standalone app that contains most key features of the platform, and you can install it on any computer without taking all the steps to create the full Angular environment. The free Angular app allows users to get started by learning Angular’s key features and creating a basic app of their own.</p><p><strong>What careers use Angular?</strong></p><p>Angular is one of the most popular web development platforms in use today. Skills in using Angular can be helpful for several careers in fields related to web design and development. Angular skills are most important for careers in practical web development, including specialties like frontend development, which involves designing client-facing web elements such as visual content, UI and UX development, and general software development. Software engineers and site designers can also benefit from learning Angular. It is a JavaScript application, so it’s also useful for JavaScript developers. It’s also possible to create a career around a specialization in Angular development alone. Angular development specialists can work as consultants or independent contractors with multiple organizations needing web development services.</p><p><strong>What IDE is best for Angular?</strong></p><p>An integrated development environment, or IDE, is a software application that consolidates essential web developer tools in a single graphical interface, which streamlines the development process and promotes consistency across all relevant platforms. Many IDEs now support Angular development projects, and there’s an option for every budget. The best paid IDE for Angular is Angular IDE. It was developed especially for the platform, so it supports all its features. Angular IDE is available as a standalone plugin or with an Eclipse plugin. New users can get a 45-day free trial before purchasing. Visual Studio Code is a general-purpose IDE that supports multiple development platforms, including Angular. This free, open-source IDE from Microsoft includes support for TypeScript code and several downloadable Angular plugins.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience. </p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong> You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now <strong>Front End Web Development with React JS, Angular, Bootstrap </strong>course</p><p>We offer&nbsp;<strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you as fired up as I am? Do you want to build something awesome? Something amazing? Are you a web developer who wants a cool job? If so, then this course is for you. In this course, you will learn how to build a complete Restaurant booking system with food ordering in the same web app from the ground up in a few hours. I already made sure that every part of this course is concise, elegant, and informative, so don't miss out on this cool opportunity. I also included the files needed in different parts of the course for you to follow along with me step by step.</p><p><br><br>Here is what you are going to learn, first of all, I am going to introduce you to the tools that we are going to be using in this course. We are going to build a class that will help us throughout the whole project and then we are going to build a full authentication system from scratch. While building this system I am going to introduce you to hashing and dehashing passwords. And then, we are going to build general and cool features inside our own app. It's going to be mainly on selecting and placing data. After this part, We are going to build a cart system where we will allow users to add food items to the cart so they can order these items online. And then naturally to the checkout page and after this, I am going to show you how to pay with PayPal easily and nicely. After this part is done I am going to show you how the booking part is done with clean elegant code and full validation. Since this part is done we will only have some general parts on the user end like grabbing bookings and orders for every user, allowing users to write reviews, and so on. And then to the admin panel which is going to be really simple yet very functional and you are going to learn a lot building it. So, to sum up, if that sounds like something interesting to you, go ahead and get the course now.</p>",

You will learn about the actor system, how to create hierarchical structures in Akka, and how to make routes in order to send messages to other actors. We will look at other use cases such as building an actor that can change its behavior during runtime. You will then create stateful actors, work with a cluster system, and work with remote actors. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Then, this Learning Path will make you understand how to build Reactive microservices using Akka and Akka HTTP, which adhere to the principles underlying the Reactive Manifesto. You will delve deeper into concepts such as Responsive, Resilient, Elastic, and Message-Driven and will see how microservices should be designed to adhere to those principles. By the end of this Path, you’ll be well-versed in creating applications and microservices.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The goal of this course is to make you efficient at building applications and microservices with Akka.</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This Learning Path is authored by some of the best in the field.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Salma Khater</strong> is a senior software engineer with over 5 years of professional experience in development and deploying applications on the JVM using both functional and object-oriented paradigms including Scala and Java.

  "description": "<p>From this course, you can learn <strong>Web Development in Java.</strong></p><p>There are a lot of other courses on this topic. <strong>So, why would you choose exactly this course?&nbsp; </strong>Here are just a few reasons:<br><br><strong>- Coding examples</strong></p><p>To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Being able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO&nbsp;and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you. Probably you always dreamed about running your startup?&nbsp;In this course, you will be able to find the team who will teach you how to do that and (in particular cases) will be glad to help with implementation! </p><p>Hope you enjoy this course! And remember, we appreciate all your feedback! Your feedback will help us to become even better!&nbsp;Your feedback will help us to create to best Java course ever! </p><p>See you at the lessons!&nbsp;:)</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>An <strong>API</strong> is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. It’s sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an information user—establishing the content required from the consumer (the call) and the content required by the producer (the response). For example, the API design for a weather service could specify that the user supply a zip code and that the producer reply with a 2-part answer, the first being the high temperature, and the second being the low.&nbsp; </p><p>In other words, if you want to interact with a computer or system to retrieve information or perform a function, an API helps you communicate what you want to that system so it can understand and fulfill the request. </p><p>You can think of an API as a mediator between the users or clients and the resources or web services they want to get. It’s also a way for an organization to share resources and information while maintaining security, control, and authentication—determining who gets access to what. </p><p>Another advantage of an API is that you don’t have to know the specifics of caching—how your resource is retrieved or where it comes from.</p><p>A <strong>REST API</strong> (also known as Restful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with Restful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.</p><p>REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.</p><p>When a client request is made via a Restful API, it transfers a representation of the state of the resource to the requester or endpoint. This information, or representation, is delivered in one of several formats via HTTP: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is the most generally popular file format to use because, despite its name, it’s language-agnostic, as well as readable by both humans and machines. </p><p><strong>Python </strong>is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn’t specialized for any specific problems. This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming languages today.</p><p>Python, one of the most popular programming languages in the world, has created everything from Netflix’s recommendation algorithm to the software that controls self-driving cars. Python is a general-purpose language, which means it’s designed to be used in a range of applications, including data science, software and web development, automation, and generally getting stuff done.</p><p><strong>Django</strong> is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It is free and open source, has a thriving and active community, great documentation, and many options for free and paid-for support. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Flask</strong> is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.</p><p><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features .</p><p><strong>Postman</strong> is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This is not a Netflix clone and not even close. Why?&nbsp;Netflix is a complex system of engineer that no one class could ever fully cover. If I told you that you could build a Netflix clone in less than 40 hours, I would be lying to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead, this is a foundation of what a Netflix-like service could be. This foundation only matters as it serves a roadmap to understanding Django on a whole new level.</p><p><br></p><p>Django is the most popular web framework in the world written in Python and for good reason: <strong><em>Django is incredibly simple and incredibly complex</em></strong>. </p><p><br></p><p>Models, Views, Forms, User Auth and Templates are fundament to Django. After completing one of my Try Django series, you'll see that creating rich web applications is, well, pretty simple.&nbsp; Models map to database tables. Views essentially handle a url and render templates. Forms help validate data and templates are essentially HTML with a little programming built it.</p><p>If the paragraph above is unclear, this course is not for you.</p><p><br></p><p>Django's complexity comes with the layers of abstraction you can start to build within your projects. To me, these layers come from Generic Foreign Keys &amp;&nbsp;Proxy Models.&nbsp; The complexity on the surface might be intimating (it was for me)&nbsp;but after you get familiar with them you'll come to find their complexity to be less daunting and potentially, no longer complex.</p><p><br></p><p>The goal of this course is to introduce your to a number of concepts you may have never seen before while building the foundation for a service that could potentially grow into Netflix. </p><p><br></p><p>Here's some topics we'll cover:</p><ul><li><p>Proxy Models</p></li><li><p>Generic Foreign Keys</p></li><li><p>Generic Relations</p></li><li><p>Automated Unit Testing</p></li><li><p>ManyToMany&nbsp;Fields vs Foreign Keys vs Generic Foreign Keys</p></li><li><p>Through models for ManyToMany</p></li><li><p>Reverse Relationships</p></li><li><p>Creating a Rating System (user ratings)</p></li><li><p>Complex Search Lookups with Q Lookups</p></li><li><p>Re-usuable model receiver functions</p></li><li><p>Custom template tag for rending a rating form</p></li><li><p>and much more</p></li></ul><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>With this course, you will learn to build a NodeJS (HapiJS) JSON-based Restful API backend for sentiment analysis and a ReactJS client that interacts with the API. HapiJS, a rich and configuration-centric server framework for NodeJS allows  us to build powerful and configurable applications. Moreover, sentiment analysis allows automated reasoning about sentences to determine whether they are positive, negative or neutral. A popular use case is to find out how people feel about a product or service. This is course introduces you to a powerful Python package, NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit), that allows you to do more than sentiment analysis. Aside from learning and building together a HapiJS API and ReactJS App, we learn how to integrate the NLTK Python package (and for that matter any other Python package) into a NodeJS application.</p>\n\n<p>We will start by first building a HapiJS server that can receive texts and send simple responses. We will interact with our server via Chrome's Postman plugin. Then, we will integrate VADER NLTK sentiment analysis into the server, that will allow the server to determine the sentiments of sentences in English. Afterwards, we will build a ReactJS client that allows us to enter and send sentences to the server and display the sentiment of a our sentence.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So, in summary, this learning by doing doing course is prepared for you to:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>learn the HapiJS framework of NodeJS for building API backends.</li><li>learn to use the VADER module of the NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit) for sentiment analysis.</li><li>learn to integrate Python modules into NodeJS.</li><li>learn to build apps in ReactJS.</li><li>understand the new concepts in JavaScript (e.g Promise, arrow functions, etc).</li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>Software is everywhere. We interact with it in our daily life activities knowingly or unknowingly. Each time when you use an app like Instagram, send an instant message, or check the stock prices on your phone, you're using an API. The world still needs more software to make our life easier. But creating great software is hard for everyone and yet developers need to master more than one skill. </p><p>This problem can be solved by API (Application Program Interface). It is a software-to-software interface that enables two applications to exchange data among each other. Just like any buttons on the remote does have a unique function. It is true almost all applications using API to interact with each other.</p><p>Understanding how the API works to deploying API is the objective of this course. In this course you will learn fundamentals of the API like http requests, endpoints, routes, CRUD operations and much more in pragmatic style.</p><p>In this course you will learn how to create a simple API for different HTTP methods like get, post, put, patch and delete. Also learn how to efficiently store data to the database using flask SQL alchemy.</p><p>To test API's, you will also learn to use Postman. Postman is an API client that makes it easy for developers like you to create, share, test and document APIs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You'll be able to...</strong></p><ul><li><p>Build rest API using flask and sqlalchemy</p></li><li><p>Test API using Postman</p></li><li><p>Perform CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update and Delete</p></li><li><p>Build different HTTP methods- Get, Post, Put, Patch and Delete</p></li></ul><p>This course has short and concise lessons in pragmatic style to make you confident over REST api. Hope this course help you to learn something new and take your skill to the next level.</p><p>All the best. Keep Learning and keep moving ahead. </p>",
