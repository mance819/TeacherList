  "description": "<p>  \t We built an immersive game development course that teaches you all of the fundamentals so you can build your own games on iPhones and iPads. We combine videos, notes, collaborative discussion forums, and challenging assignments to have students build real apps. Teaching online is not new to us. Our highly successful Beginner iOS Bootcamp (over 18k students and 5 star review) teaches students the basics of programming iOS apps. We use the same proven pedagogy to teach game development.  </p>  <p>  \t The course will include over 120 hours of content (30 hours of video plus notes and challenges), an active discussion forum where students and teachers answer questions, and multiple fully coded example projects that you can download.  </p>  <p>  \t Topics covered:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Introduction to Game Development , Sprite Kit , Scenes and Nodes, Coordinates, Game Loop</li>  \t<li>Sprite/Texture Creation, Sprite Theory, Atlas Files</li>  \t<li>Animation, Parallax Scrolling, Character animation</li>  \t<li>Physics Bodies, Physics Properties, Bit Fields, Collisions, Contact Response</li>  \t<li>User Input, Input Handler</li>  \t<li>Character Movement/Physics, State machines, Player Physics, Jump Curve, Double Jump, Boost, etc.</li>  \t<li>Tile Based Game World, Tile Sprites, Tiled + Kobold Kit, Creating and Loading Tiled files</li>  \t<li>Collision Detection, Axis Alined Bounding Box, Collision Bit Masks</li>  \t<li>Obstacles &amp; Enemies, Basic Enemy AI</li>  \t<li>Collectables, Power Ups</li>  \t<li>Effects, Particle Effects</li>  \t<li>Sound, Adding Music, Adding Sound Effects</li>  \t<li>Scoring, HUD, Stats/Progress Tracking, Score Board</li>  \t<li>Game Menus, Saving/Loading Game Progression</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t Reviews from our iOS course  </p>  <p>  \t &quot;I must say that so far, this course is awesome. Having the challenging assignments, daily discussions and feedback from the instructors, has been the missing piece that I have been looking for. I have read a handful of books, watched hours of video &amp; typed in a bunch of tutorials, and finally, having to work through tough assignments and applying what I have been learning, it is all starting to click - Finally!&quot; <em style=\"\">- Mark S.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t “Code Coalition&#039;s discussion board is one of the best resources for a beginning iOS developer.

I feel it&#039;s been well worth the investment. ” <em style=\"\">- Herdy H.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t &quot;Wow, @CodeCoalition! Moving quickly! Week 2 is so different than week 1...and I like it :) Thnx for the challenge&quot; <em style=\"\">- Melissa B.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t “Just discovered @CodeCoalition! An excellent resource for anyone who wants to make their first iPhone app.”<em style=\"\"> -Novall K.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t “Can&#039;t reiterate it enough how this course is helping me with my iOS dev skills. I think using protocols and delegation is finally becoming second nature. Fingers crossed :-)”<em style=\"\"> -Alex P.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t “I am really loving the class. I have taken classes at Code School &amp; Treehouse and both were missing a key element. The ability to ask questions as you complete a section and get an answer. “ <em style=\"\">-Lisa A.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t “Your training is the best out there so far. I wish I had the time away from regular job to follow along.” <em style=\"\">-Christian S.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t “Im loving this.. I have been through at least 5 books, and many online deals. Yours is super so far. Finally, i can get from start to finish on a lesson without wondering why on &quot;Everything&quot; thank youCant wait to do more.. “<em style=\"\"> -Kevin R.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t Why take this course and how much time does it take to complete?  </p>  <p>  \t iOS game development, and software development as a whole, is a booming career. The demand for new developers at all levels far outweighs the supply. Barrier to entry is not as high as one would think - though passion and hard work are necessary, a degree in computer science or any other technical field is not required.  </p>  <p>  \t We aim to take you from complete beginner to junior game developer in three months. The apps you create in this course can be used on your portfolio so you have something to show when you apply for jobs. Not only that, you can throw your apps on the app store and be the next Flappy Bird!  </p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>This course was funded through a massively successful Kickstarter campaign.</strong></p><p>In this course, you learn how to build small VR Games and one Big Mobile Game using Unity® and Blender. This course is unique because we make both the code and the art for the game from scratch. ​<strong>We teach you the fundamentals of designing, coding, and modeling a mobile game.</strong></p><p>First you design the game and its functionality in Unity®. You learn how to code in C# and build video game levels. Don't worry if you've never coded before. We ​<strong>start simple</strong> and add more to the game as the course goes on.</p><p><strong>Why Unity®?</strong></p><p>Unity® is one of the most popular platforms in game development. You can use Unity® to build 2D and 3D games. Unity® is cross-platform, which means it is easy to use with other platforms.</p><p>Then you create the art for the game in Blender. You build all the art assets for the game. You learn how to integrate your art from Blender into Unity®.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why Blender?</strong></p><p>Blender, like Unity®, is a popular production suite that is free to download. Blender is a revolutionary tool for making 3D art digitally. With Blender, you can make art assets for games, like we do in this course.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Is this course for me?</strong></p><p>Even if you're not an artist, you can make basic art models. You may have heard of Axiom Verge and Stardew Valley. These games are million-dollar successes. But did you know that only one person made each?&nbsp;</p><p>Usually it takes a whole team of people to build a game. But creators Thomas Happ and Eric Barone developed and designed their games by themselves. Now they're millionaires. You can do it, too.</p><p>Also now included in these bundles are our extra courses. If you want to learn to use other programs such as Camtasia or Sketch, you get more content than what you paid for this way!</p><p>We really hope you decide to purchase this course and take your knowledge to the next level. Let's get started.</p><p><strong>Enroll now to join the community!</strong></p>",

Lots of people play them and every year more people are making them.&nbsp;If you have ever played a computer game and thought, “I wonder how they do that?”&nbsp;or, better yet, “I want to make something like that,” then this&nbsp;course&nbsp;will get you started.&nbsp;Game development is what got many developers into programming. But how many of us actually ever learned how to create games? Creating games can be challenging, but it doesn’t have to be that way! </p><p><strong>MonoGame</strong> is a cross platform gaming framework&nbsp;based on Microsoft’s XNA framework that’s extremely easy to learn. MonoGame is a simple and powerful&nbsp; framework for creating games for desktop PCs, video game consoles, and mobile devices using the C# programming language. Best of all, games you build with MonoGame will run on iOS, Android, Mac OS X, tvOS, Windows, Linux, PlayStation 4, and more—write once, play anywhere.&nbsp; It has been succesfully used to create games such as Streets of Rage 4, Carrion, Celeste, Stardew Valley, and many other.</p><p>It is a re-implementation of the discontinued Microsoft's XNA Framework, and it provides the following features:</p><ul><li><p>Game framework</p></li><li><p>2D and 3D rendering</p></li><li><p>Sound effect and music playback</p></li><li><p>Keyboard, mouse, touch, and controller inputs</p></li><li><p>Content building and optimization</p></li><li><p>Math library optimized for games</p></li></ul><p>There’s no shortage of options when it comes to game development environments. From full-featured engines like Unity to comprehensive and complex multimedia APIs like DirectX, it can be hard to know where to start. MonoGame is a set of tools, with a level of complexity falling somewhere between a game engine and a grittier API like DirectX. It provides an easy-to-use content pipeline, and all the functionality required to create lightweight games that run on a wide variety of platforms. </p><p>MonoGame is a \"bring your own tools\" kind of framework, which means that it provides the building blocks to build your own engine and tools, but it isn't quite an engine itself.</p><p>If you are expecting a scene editor (like Unity or Unreal), MonoGame is not that.</p><p>If you love coding and understanding how things work under the hood, MonoGame might be what you are looking for. And fear not, getting a game running with MonoGame only takes a few minutes.</p><p>Best of all, MonoGame apps are written in pure C#, and you can distribute them quickly via the Microsoft Store or other similar distribution platforms.</p><p><strong>Our focus will be working with Visual Studio Community (Compatible with Versions 2019/2022) on Windows machines </strong></p><p><strong>*** Update 2023 **</strong><br>All MonoGame Demos have now been updated to <strong>Version 3.8</strong> (released late 2022) <br>Previously MonoGame installed on your machine through an installer, but from 3.8 onwards everything is installed through NuGet packages and Visual Studio Extensions. The <strong>most notable change</strong> for existing users is that MonoGame will <strong>only support .NET 6 and Visual Studio 2022</strong> moving forward.</p><p><strong>Note:<br></strong>MonoGame 3.8 project templates are not compatible with earlier versions of MonoGame. If you wish to work on or build older MonoGame projects, then you will still need to install MonoGame 3.7.1 or earlier to open them. WindowsDX and DesktopGL templates now use SDK-style projects in MonoGame 3.8 <br><em>The 3.7.1 demos are still maintained in the course.</em></p><p>This&nbsp;course&nbsp;assumes that you’ve done a little bit of&nbsp;&nbsp;programming in C# but&nbsp;&nbsp;all the material starts at the most basic level. That means that anyone should be able to join in&nbsp;and work their way through the material. That’s the good news.<br><br>The bad news is that programming is hard work, especially at first. If you truly want to learn how to program, you’ll need to write programs yourself and struggle through some rough spots before some topics really click for you. Just as you can’t learn how to ride a bicycle by reading about it – you have to actually do it, probably with some spills along the way – you can’t learn to program just by reading about it or watching a video. If you were hoping to watch and&nbsp;&nbsp;learn how to program without doing any programming yourself, it’s not going to happen... But having said that don't feel you are alone, I will be available daily for extra help should you need it.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This&nbsp;course is&nbsp;<strong>project-based</strong>, so you will not just be learning dry programming concepts, but applying them immediately to real games as you go. All the project files will be included, as well as additional references and resources&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here's how I will help you to succeed:</strong></p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each lecture starts with a list of objectives/speaking notes</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every example covered in the lecture is available for download in the resources section &nbsp;… including the objectives/speaking notes</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost every lecture has a set of Practice problems with full solutions provided</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My style of writing and teaching follows the KISS principle :<strong><em> Keep It Super Simple</em></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I try to stay away from fancy computer terminology and try to teach like am speaking to a brand new user with little to no previous knowledge on the subject matter.... and &nbsp;I am always available for help … replying most times within a day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>.... And finally please do not judge a book by it's cover ... don't judge the course by the title or this small description section, if you want to know exactly all the topics covered please go to: </strong></p><p><em>COURSE CONTENT <br>Sections <br>Lectures&nbsp; (press the down arrow) ... This will open up literally thousands of lines of very detailed lecture descriptions leaving no doubt what is and what is not covered.</em><br></p><p>... So are you ready to start making your first games ? Lets get started !</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>This course is made with the latest content and newest technics used in modern Game Development (Unreal Engine 5 2022)</strong></p><p>The best way to learn anything is by doing it in a <strong>really fun way</strong> and this is where this course comes from. If you want to learn how all these <strong>incredible games</strong> you see are made there is no better place to start than this course. </p><p>We made sure that this course has everything you need to take you from a beginner <strong>(even with zero codding experience)</strong> and slowly take you to intermediate level.</p><p>I chose the main project in this course to be a <strong>3D First Person Platformer </strong>because it not only has a vast library of game development concepts that we can implement and learn.</p><p>Also because it's very <strong>simple (especially if you are a beginner) </strong>to delve in and get started on your <strong>game development journey.</strong></p><p>Everything in this course has been <strong>meticulously crafted</strong>, review and recrafted to provide you with the <strong>best experience</strong> possible and maximize your learning as much as possible. </p><p>So not only will you have a great time learning you'll also get the <strong>MOST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK</strong> by going away from this course with a lot of tools in your arsenal to continue you journey in the <strong>wild west</strong> of game development.</p><p><strong>Section 1: Introduction</strong></p><p>We'll start off by downloading Epic Games Launcher. Downloading Unreal Engine 5 and we'll lay the ground. We'll understand a bit of history about the Unreal Engine and we'll make our First Game just to get ourselves into the mood. </p><p><strong>Section 2: Building Virtual Worlds Level Editor</strong></p><p>In this section we are going to start learning the very basics of the viewport. We'll understand how to move around the viewport, use the various navigations and learn what each every single window we see infront of us does. </p><p><strong>Section 3: Unreal Architecture Actors</strong></p><p>In this section we will learn about Actors. We'll understand static mesh actors, geometry brushes, volumes and Materials. We finish off by creating and learning to set up the lighting and atmosphere instead of using the one we are given. </p><p><strong>Section 4: CyberSpy 3027 - Building Our World</strong></p><p>This section will be a culmination of what we learned in the previous 2 sections. We'll be setting up the light, atmosphere and skyline. We'll create our first level and build our inner basic structure to start working with future features. </p><p><strong>Section 5: Blueprint Visual Scripting</strong></p><p>Time to understand the concept of Blueprint Scripting in a very easy way. We'll understand what the windows in the interface mean, go though nodes, connect them and create a flow control between them. We also delve into timelines for simple animations.</p>",

You'll learn to <strong>create epic explosions</strong> and break things like a pro. By the end, <strong>you'll be demolishing buildings and making cars go boom</strong>. It’s all about making chaos look awesome.</p><p>But it's not just about explosions. We'll get into the nitty-gritty of Blender's rigid bodies and particle systems. You’ll <strong>understand how to make objects collide and interact with realistic physics.</strong> It’s like playing with digital Legos that can explode!</p><p>Imagine jets flying across water, leaving waves behind. Yeah, we’ll teach you that too. You'll be able to add splashes and other effects to make your scenes come alive. <strong>It's all about making your animations or film look as cool as possible.</strong></p><p>This course is perfect if you’re <strong>tired of your scenes looking flat and boring</strong>.

Whether you’re a complete beginner, have dabbled in Verse, or have experience in other programming languages, this course will equip you with the skills to bring your creative game ideas to life—and maybe even turn your creativity into a source of income.</p><p>We’ll start from the basics, covering essential programming concepts such as data types, if-else statements, loops, arrays, and maps. But it’s not just about learning theory—you’ll apply these concepts to real-world projects. By the end of this course, you’ll have completed multiple projects you can publish and share with the world.</p><p>This course also focuses on the most critical skills for programmers: problem-solving, research, and trial and error. I’ll take you through my entire problem-solving process, teaching you how to debug and resolve issues step-by-step. You’ll gain the confidence to tackle challenges head-on and improve through hands-on practice.</p><p>What’s this course <em>not</em> about? It’s not an advanced course for seasoned professionals, nor does it cover artistic building techniques or in-depth UEFN design. Instead, it’s a beginner-friendly journey that takes you from no coding experience to confident level of proficiency in Verse programming.</p><p>If you’re ready to turn your creative ideas into reality, click enroll, and let’s get started.

  "description": "<p>Have you ever wanted to implement a parkour system in Unreal Engine but found existing tutorials too complex or lacking explanations? This course is designed to bridge that gap by teaching you how to create a <strong>fully modular parkour system</strong> from scratch using <strong>Blueprints, Motion Warping, and Animation Montages</strong>.</p><p>We’ll start by building a <strong>parkour detection system</strong> using Sphere Traces, allowing the character to detect obstacles dynamically. From there, we’ll measure <strong>obstacle height and depth</strong> to determine the appropriate parkour action—whether it's <strong>climbing, mantling, or vaulting</strong>. You'll also learn how to work with <strong>custom collision channels</strong>, ensuring precise interaction with parkour objects.</p><p>To make our system <strong>fully modular</strong>, we’ll implement it inside an <strong>Actor Component</strong>, allowing you to easily integrate it into any Unreal Engine project. We’ll refine animation blending, implement <strong>Motion Warping for smooth transitions</strong>, and dynamically control <strong>Foot IK using Animation Curves</strong> to maintain realistic movement.</p><p>Finally, we’ll <strong>export our parkour system</strong> and integrate it into a <strong>custom Unreal Engine project</strong>, demonstrating how to transfer and adapt the system to different environments and characters.</p><p>By the end of this course, you’ll have a <strong>reusable, game-ready parkour system</strong> that can be adapted to any Unreal Engine project with ease.<br><br>Join the <strong>Discord community</strong> to get instant help, share your progress, and connect with fellow developers working on the same parkour system. Whether you have a question, need troubleshooting advice, or just want to discuss new ideas, our community is there to support you.

  "description": "<p><strong>Simple inventory system with multiplayer.</strong></p><p>Make a simple inventory system from start to finish in Unreal Engine 5 multiplayer. The inventory made in this course is a multiplayer RPG inventory system similar to Zelda, Maplestory, and Minecraft. We will do that without writing a single line of code thanks to Unreal Engine Blueprint.</p><p>This Unreal Engine course requires no previous game development experience. I will guide you through the process step-by-step. Creating an inventory system is crucial in almost every game. It is crucial to know how to set up an easy inventory system as an Unreal Engine developer, as it is a common feature in almost every game.</p><p>Whether you are a beginner or an experienced Unreal Engine developer, this course is for everyone who wants to learn how to make a simple inventory system in Unreal Engine 5.</p><p>Get started on your simple inventory system today, and let's not waste any time!</p><p><strong>What makes me qualified to teach you?</strong></p><p>I am an experienced game developer with nine years of experience. To summarize my work without boring you:</p><ul><li><p>I have released a Steam game I directed from start to finish with a team of 8.</p></li><li><p>I have created 11 game development courses with 40,000+ students and an average rating of 4.8+ out of 5 stars.</p></li><li><p>I am currently solo-developing Farmtale 2 from start to finish.</p></li><li><p>I also work as a freelancer on various game projects, specializing in programming, lighting, game optimization, and more.</p></li></ul><p>I am deeply passionate about game development and have made it my full-time job. I would love to teach you everything about Unreal Engine 5 with good game development practices and keep you updated with the latest information.</p><p>If you want to learn <strong>how to publish a game on Steam</strong>, check out the course I have released on the topic.</p><p><strong>Make games without coding.</strong></p><p>Unreal Engine Blueprint is the powerful Unreal Engine scripting language used in Unreal Engine 5. It allows you to make games without coding. This means that even if you are a beginner, artist, or designer without programming experience, you can easily create your own online game.</p><p>Unreal Engine Blueprint is just as powerful as any programming language. If you become proficient in Unreal Engine Blueprint, you won't need to learn any other language to develop your game.</p><p>This course doesn't require any programming or Unreal Engine experience. We will start with the basics of Unreal Engine Blueprint and gradually move on to developing more complex game mechanics. Doing so will teach you how to develop games from start to finish.</p><p>You can start this Unreal Engine course as a beginner and learn step-by-step how to create a simple inventory system from scratch.</p><p><strong>Unreal Engine 5 multiplayer.</strong></p><p>Getting into online game development in Unreal Engine 5 is very easy. It is similar to the single-player Unreal Engine Blueprint but with an extra step added. When you learn how to make an inventory system, you'll also learn about Unreal Engine 5 multiplayer. Prior experience is optional, as I will guide you through the basics and advanced concepts of Unreal Engine networking.</p><p><strong>Make inventory in games like a pro.</strong></p><p>In this course, you'll learn everything about making an inventory system in Unreal Engine 5. The inventory is done in multiplayer. It's easy to make mistakes while making a game inventory, which you can see in many indie games. The inventory is either lagging or contains bugs.</p><p>Even though it's a simple inventory system, you will learn complex inventory mechanics during the course. We will make the inventory with optimized code and free from bugs.</p><p>You will learn the best programming practices when making the RPG inventory and interaction system. Making the simple inventory system will make you skilled enough to create any RPG-style inventory for your future game projects.</p><p><strong>What you will go through in this course.</strong></p><p>While learning how to set up an inventory system, you will go through many inventory mechanics you will need for your game projects:</p><ul><li><p>Create the inventory UI, including the inventory slots and categories.</p></li><li><p>Learn to design and program inventory in games using Unreal Engine 5 multiplayer.</p></li><li><p>Learn how to move items around correctly in your inventory.</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create stackable items with options to adjust the stack amount.</p></li><li><p>Create different item types such as consumables, food, weapons, and more.</p></li><li><p>Create inventory categories to sort the items correctly.</p></li><li><p>Learn how to loot and drop items from your inventory.</p></li><li><p>Learn to control all inventory and item values, such as item loot amount, item stack size, item inventory icon, and more.</p></li></ul><p>The simple inventory system will teach you everything you need to know about creating an inventory system in Unreal Engine 5.</p><p><strong>Take this course and get certified.</strong></p><p>Completing the simple inventory system course earns you an Unreal Engine certification. You can use it to strengthen your portfolio as an independent game developer or use it when applying for game development jobs. The Unreal Engine certification can be downloaded and saved locally and is valid indefinitely.</p><p><strong>How do you continue when completing the course?</strong></p><p>The simple inventory system provides the skills and knowledge to advance toward challenging topics. You can use this RPG style inventory when you create your own online game. For instance, you can use the easy inventory system in the course on learning <strong>how to make a Platformer game</strong>. You can also use the simple inventory system in the course on <strong>how to make a FPS game</strong>. If you wish to try out single-player Unreal Engine game development, you can look at <strong>how to make a clicker game</strong>.</p><p>Whatever you decide, it's important to take more game development courses to further develop your Unreal Engine Blueprint skills. Getting better at game development is all about repetition.</p><p><strong>Join our supportive community.</strong></p><p>Unreal Engine game development can be a frustrating experience at times. For example, you might need to look for an unchecked box somewhere, leaving you feeling lost for hours. Alternatively, you might require moral support and ideas from fellow game developers like yourself. That's why we offer live support 24/7 in the Q/A section or in our <strong>community Discord server</strong>. You can also join us to chat casually about game development in general or share your work with others. We are always here to help you whenever you need it.</p><p>Let's start with the simple inventory system without any delay. I am looking forward to seeing you in the first lesson.

  "description": "<p>In this course, you’ll learn to <strong>create a third-person melee combat system in Unity with features like combos, counterattacks, intelligent enemy AI</strong>, etc. <strong>We'll design this system in a modular, data-driven, and scalable way using clean coding practices</strong>. So in this course, you’ll not only learn to build this system, but you’ll also learn lots of <strong>valuable game programming concepts that you can use throughout your career</strong></p><p><br></p><p>So the combat system that we’re going to create will be a <strong>free-flow combat system</strong>. That means <strong>enemies won’t attack the player mindlessly; instead, they’ll attack in a coordinated way by circling the player and attacking one at a time</strong>. This is the type of combat used in modern-day games like Assassin's Creed, Batman Arkham series, Marvel’s Spider-Man, etc. This combat system will also be easily customizable, so if you want to use punch and kick attacks instead of sword attacks, you can do that easily without changing a single line of code</p><p><br></p><p>So we’ll be building all this step-by-step from scratch. <strong>We’ll start by making a basic third-person controller</strong>. We’ll not use any assets for it; we’ll build it from scratch because it’s a good way to learn the fundamentals of gameplay programming. And then we'll give our character the ability to attack. <strong>We’ll architect the attacks using scriptable objects in Unity so that the designer will be able to create and edit different attack combos without changing the code</strong>. Then we'll start building the enemy AI. <strong>We'll be architecting the enemy AI using a finite-state machine</strong>. It's a technique that’s been used for building AI in games for the last 25 years. It's used in popular games like Last of Us, the Batman Arkham series, and many more. So we'll build a Finite-State Machine from scratch and create our enemies using it. We'll start by creating simple enemy behaviors like Idling and Chasing the player, then we'll implement more advanced behaviors like circling the player and attacking him in a coordinated way. Once we're done with the Enemy AI, we'll implement the counterattacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout this course, you’ll learn lots of game programming skills. You’ll learn lots of <strong>intermediate-level C# concepts like Generic Classes, Dictionary, LINQ, Inheritance</strong>, etc. You’ll also l<strong>earn to use Mathematical concepts like Trigonometry, Dot Product, Cross Product</strong>, etc. So the <strong>skills and techniques that you learn from this course will be really helpful for you if want to pursue a career as a game programmer</strong>.</p>",

  "description": "<p>If you struggle with the <strong>new Input System</strong>, or you want to transfer your projects from the old input system and create a <strong>functional rebinding system</strong>, then you are at the right place. </p><p>You can easily follow the course by downloading Unity projects: <strong>2D Platformer </strong>and<strong> 2D top-down RPG </strong>perspective. After you download them, unzip them and open them through Unity Editor. Then you are ready to start following the lectures. Of course, if you wish, you can use your assets. We will also quickly analyze the input of Unity's official 3D asset and see which workflow they use. </p><p>In this course, you will learn how to use the new Input System in 4 main ways:</p><ul><li><p>Direct</p></li><li><p>Embedded Actions</p></li><li><p>Actions Asset</p></li><li><p>Player Input Component</p></li></ul><p>Some of the main ways have iterations within them, and of course, we will go through all those iterations. This gives you knowledge and options to choose what is the best option for your game and coding style. </p><p>In the last part of the course, we will create a custom rebinding system. This system is really important if you want to make<strong> serious commercial games. </strong></p><p>Trust me, I have seen it multiple times, you can get negative reviews on Steam if you don't have a rebinding system. User experience is limited if players can't adjust the game and controls for their needs. So, every commercial game needs a rebinding system. </p><p>The rebinding system from this course is unique, you won't find tutorials about it anywhere else. <strong>The system will automatically detect and swap duplicate bindings</strong>. The changes are persistent, meaning they will be preserved between play sessions. </p><p>So, improve your game development skills, learn the new input system in the right way, and create a professional rebinding system that players can use to set up custom controls. </p><p><strong>Customer Support:</strong></p><p><strong>I respond to all messages if you get stuck anywhere or need help.</strong></p><p><strong>Thank you for your time and see you in the course lessons.</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>Making games is fun but there is nothing more frustrating than adding new code to create a new game mechanic just to have the old code break. At this point it stops being fun and bug search begin - which honestly is the least fun thing to do when you could instead design a new level for your game. That is why it is so important to learn how to create maintainable and extensible code base for your game. If you search for a solution you will find Design patterns and SOLID principles. If you have every tried to learn design patterns you surely know that it is not intuitive when to use it. Each presents a solution but requires time and additional code to work. Implementing them just for the sake of it is just a waste of time - so when should we use them?&nbsp;The answer is - when adding new features or extending the old ones seems like a lot of work and effort.</p><p><br></p><p>In this course you will learn how to use state pattern as a base to create your character controller and how to refactor your code to other design patterns when you can see that adding new feature starts to be \"painful\" and unintuitive. At the end you will know the way of thinking behind the refactoring process and behind the decision when to use design patterns.</p><p>You will learn how to write decoupled classes - meaning that class A doesn't rely on Class B but if they both exist they can communicate witch each other to create our desired game mechanics.</p><p>This is an Intermediate course about creating a maintainable and extensible codebase and in effect a full 2d platformer game. You should know your way around Unity and feel comfortable coding in C# using Visual Studio IDE.</p><p>You will learn how to:</p><ul><li><p>Create a character that can move and jump and extend it's character controller with new features like:&nbsp;climbing behaviour, attack logic etc.</p></li><li><p>How to reuse players character controller for enemies </p></li><li><p>How to create 3 types of enemies as well as a end level boss</p></li><li><p>How to use factor method pattern to make your code more maintainable</p></li><li><p>How to use Strategy pattern to implement simple AI system </p></li></ul><p>Specific platformer features that we will implement:</p><ul><li><p>picking up resources</p></li><li><p>respawn system</p></li><li><p>adding platforms with one-way collider</p></li><li><p>creating parallax effect for our level</p></li><li><p>melee and throwable weapons</p></li></ul><p>and much more!</p><p>If for any reason you don't enjoy the course you have 30 days from the purchased date to get your money back - no questions asked.</p><p>I hope to see you in the course :)</p><p>-Peter</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Important Note:</strong><br>All source code provided in this course remains valid and compatible with the latest versions of Android Studio and Android SDKs.<br>Please note, however, that the course was originally created using an earlier version of Android Studio and the Android SDK.</p><p>If your goal is to:</p><ul><li><p>Learn <strong>game development logic</strong> from the ground up,</p></li><li><p>Build a <strong>game loop</strong> from scratch,</p></li><li><p>Create your own <strong>custom game framework</strong> to develop future games more quickly and efficiently,</p></li><li><p>And you wish to <strong>code entirely in Java</strong> without relying on external game engines,</p></li></ul><p>— then this course is ideal for you. Otherwise, we recommend exploring other courses that better match your needs.</p><p><br>Hi, welcome to the Android Game Development Course. Here, we'll be creating these 4 games from scratch, using only Android Studio and Java: 1) <strong>Retro Ping Pong </strong>game, 2) <strong>Bird Hunt</strong> game 3) <strong>Balloon Shooter</strong> game and 4) <strong>Duck Hunt</strong> game. I only except you know a little bit of Java programming like using variables, loops, objects, etc. Other than that, I expect that you have the latest version of Android Studio installed on your Pc. </p><p><strong>Some Amazing Reviews From Our Learners</strong></p><p>- Very good introduction to game development without other tools. Haven't done anything with Touch-Control and it was nicely presented by Sandip. The translation/transsript is not allways clear but if you have basic/good English Skills it should be easy to follow. Overall thumbs up and 5 stars.</p><p>- Detailed descriptions of how to work within Android. Excellent so far!</p><p>- Wow, very good course for an all level of developer where you can learn about canvas, working with velocity, the fun of doing coding in a logical way with animation.

  "description": "<p><strong>Unreal Engine 5 Steam Multiplayer - Learn Everything</strong></p><p>This FREE course will teach you how to add Unreal Engine 5 Steam Multiplayer into your game using the advanced sessions plugin. You can accomplish all this without writing any code, as it is done entirely using Unreal Engine Blueprint.</p><p>You don't need previous experience in the advanced sessions plugin or in Unreal Engine 5 Multiplayer. We will go through everything from scratch, step by step. For this Unreal Engine course, you can use your own custom project if you have one. Or you can follow along with one of the standard unreal engine game development templates.</p><p>The main objective of this course is to teach you how to implement advanced sessions to your game project as well as the Unreal Engine Steam integration process. At the end of this course, you'll have the skills to create your own online game with a server browser, join and host servers, and more.</p><p>Let's not waste any time and jump right into the process of integrating Unreal Engine 5 Steam Multiplayer.</p><p><strong>What makes me qualified to teach you?</strong></p><p>I have nine years of experience as a game developer. To summarize my work without being boring:</p><ul><li><p>I directed a team of 8 to release a game on Steam.</p></li><li><p>I have taught over 40,000 students game development through 11 courses, earning an average rating of 4.8+ stars out of 5.</p></li><li><p>I am currently developing Farmtale 2 all by myself, from the beginning to the end.</p></li><li><p>I work as a freelancer on game projects, specializing in programming, lighting, and optimization.</p></li></ul><p>I am a full-time game developer passionate about teaching everything about Unreal Engine 5 with good game development practices and keeping you updated with the latest information.</p><p><strong>Learn all about Unreal Engine 5 Steam Multiplayer.</strong></p><p>This course will teach you every step of using Advanced Steam Session for Unreal Engine 5 Steam Multiplayer. Many game development courses online lack detail and don't go in-depth with the subject. They also teach bad coding practices, leaving your game unoptimized.</p><p>This course will cover everything in detail and help you do things correctly. The key steps covered in this course:</p><ul><li><p>Learn to install Steam Advanced Sessions.</p></li><li><p>Learn to add the Advanced Sessions plugin to your project.</p></li><li><p>You'll master Unreal Engine UI design and create the Main Menu, Host Server, and Server Browser UI.</p></li><li><p>Learn to program the functionality of the Main Menu.</p></li><li><p>Learn to host an online server on Steam.</p></li><li><p>Learn to join a hosted game server through the Server Browser.</p></li><li><p>You'll learn to update values dynamically in real-time, such as the number of players in the server and the game map being played.</p></li><li><p>Learn advanced mechanics such as searching for a specific game server, refreshing the server browser, or hiding empty servers.</p></li><li><p>Learn to package the project for friends and family to play together.</p></li></ul><p>By the end of this course, you'll be equipped with everything you need to know about Unreal Engine 5 Steam Multiplayer and the Advanced Sessions plugin. As a result, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of how to make a game on Steam with multiplayer.</p><p>Let's begin the course without delay and begin our work!</p><p><strong>Make games without coding.</strong></p><p>Unreal Engine blueprint is the powerful Unreal Engine scripting language used in UE5. It allows you to create your own online game from start to finish without writing a single line of code. That means you can easily create your own online game even if you are a beginner, artist, or designer without programming experience.</p><p>This course doesn't require any programming or Unreal Engine experience. We will go through the Unreal Engine blueprint basics and slowly advance to developing more complex game mechanics. By doing so, you will learn how to develop games from start to finish.</p><p>You can jump into this course as a beginner as you will learn how to add Unreal Engine 5 Steam multiplayer step-by-step.</p><p><strong>Unreal Engine 5 multiplayer.</strong></p><p>Getting into online game development with Unreal Engine 5 is very easy. It is similar to the single-player Unreal Engine blueprint but with an extra step added. While learning how to implement Unreal Engine 5 Steam multiplayer, you will learn everything you need to know about Unreal Engine 5 multiplayer. You don't need prior experience as I will teach you basic and advanced Unreal Engine networking.</p><p>After this course, you'll be able to learn how to add Steam Multiplayer and everything about releasing a game on Steam.</p><p><strong>Learn how to publish a game on Steam from any platform.</strong></p><p>This Unreal Engine course is about adding the Advanced Sessions plugin for UE5. That will allow you to create servers on Steam as well as join them.</p><p>However, if you wish to learn <strong>how to publish a game on Steam</strong>, check out my new course on the subject. You'll learn everything about publishing a game on Steam.</p><p>Even though the course is about publishing on Steam through Unreal Engine, you can do the same process using other game engines such as Unity, Godot, or Game Maker.</p><p>I recommend taking Unreal Engine 5 Steam multiplayer first and then afterward continuing with the course on <strong>how to publish a game on Steam</strong>. With these two courses combined, you'll be able to get into Steam online game development as well as publishing and playing with friends and family.</p><p><strong>How do I continue after this course?</strong></p><p>When finishing this Unreal Engine course, you can apply the Unreal Engine 5 Steam multiplayer to any multiplayer game. You can continue with the multiplayer courses I have released. The first is <strong>how to make a FPS Game</strong>, and the second is a multiplayer 2d course on <strong>how to make a Platformer game</strong>.</p><p>For multiplayer, you can also continue making a <strong>simple inventory system</strong>, which is needed in most games today. You can use the inventory system for both 2D and 3D games.</p><p>If you wish to get into single-player, it's worth looking at <strong>how to make a Clicker Game in 2D</strong>.</p><p>Whatever you decide, it's always good to continue with another course to keep developing your Unreal Engine skills. Keep up the excellent work, and you'll be a pro in no time. Practice and repetition are key.</p><p><strong>Take this course and get certified.</strong></p><p>Completing the Unreal Engine 5 Steam multiplayer course earns you an Unreal Engine certification. You can use it to strengthen your portfolio as an independent game developer or use it when applying for game development jobs. The Unreal Engine certification can be downloaded and saved locally and is valid indefinitely.</p><p><strong>Join our supportive community.</strong></p><p>Unreal Engine game development can be a frustrating experience at times. For example, you might need to look for an unchecked box somewhere, leaving you feeling lost for hours. Alternatively, you might require moral support and ideas from fellow game developers like yourself. That's why we offer live support 24/7 in the Q/A section or in our <strong>community Discord server</strong>. You can also join us to chat casually about game development in general or share your work with others. We are always here to help you whenever you need it.</p><p>Let's begin adding Unreal Engine 5 Steam multiplayer without any delay. I am excited to see you in our first lesson. Let's get started!</p>",

In this course, we will look at the Unity Game Engine.  </p>  <p>  \tBy the end of this course you will understand what a game engine is, how it works and how you can use game engines to create incredible realistic games. If you're interested in Unity game development, the information in this course is very valuable.  </p>  <p>  \tYou don't need to know a single thing about game development to take this course.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong> So What Is a Game Engine?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t A game engine is framework which facilitates the kinds of tasks which need to be done when writing a game. So what are the kinds of tasks we want to do? We would probably want to display images on the screen (in game terminology, an image which is displayed on the screen is called a sprite). We may need to draw menus or text on the screen. We might want to organise our sprites so that some are behind others. Often games use realistic physic so objects collide or fall with gravity. A game engine will help us do these things and many more.  </p>",

  "description": "<p>This Course is broken Down into 8 Sections. We first begin with a brief Introduction to Unity’s Universal Render Pipeline (URP) with an overview of Shader Graph. Next, we create a Unity project with the URP Template and use this as a building block to learn more about unity’s shader types. After a quick review on the types of shaders and understanding the basics of Shadergraph and exploring the user interface we move on to create our first graph which is a TV Flicker effect. The next few sections focus on creating various shaders which include a cartoon style water shader, Vortex Shader, a Dissolve shader, light flicker effect and more. We Finally wrap up the course with a mini project where we create an electric shader for a game asset. The course is created for a beginner audience new to unity so its slow paced but packed with useful tips on how to use the engine. See you in the Course.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Welcome</strong></p><p><strong>Vulkan is the newest and most popular graphics API</strong> out there. It is the successor of the already <em>deprecated </em>OpenGL, and it is the future for any kind of cross-platform graphical applications. It is extremely performant, which makes it perfect for game and game engine development.</p><p>With this course I aim to teach you the very basics of computer graphics with Vulkan in some short and simple lessons. I believe everyone can learn and it is especially important to have easy to understand chunks that can be consumed in short bursts.</p><p>This course will cover: setting up your C++ project, creating a window, initializing Vulkan, rendering a simple triangle, compiling shaders, debugging issues, rendering vertices, basic transformations for 3D.</p><p>I will not go as far as to teach complex topics like post-processing or shadows since the course aims to be short and accessible. The course will get regular updates, though that will cover any major changes in the specification.</p><p>The course is taught on Microsoft Windows, but most of the knowledge gained can be used on any platform.</p><p><strong>Technologies Used</strong></p><ul><li><p>Vulkan SDK—the main topic of the course is the Vulkan graphics library specification. This is what \"talks\" to the GPU of your PC and renders any graphical information that you send to it.</p></li><li><p>GLFW—Abstracts handling windows so that we don't have to call native platform functions. This way the course would be mostly accessible to people on any platform.</p></li><li><p>GLM—A mathematical library that will help with the transformation of 3D information.</p></li><li><p>CMake—for managing and compiling the project. We will use a modern setup that is straightforward to understand and use.</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>You’re making a game, and it’s awesome. But let’s be real—does it <em>sound</em> awesome? You could grab some generic tunes off the internet, but where’s the fun in that? <strong>Your game deserves music that’s as epic as it is!</strong></p><p>Welcome to our Sound Music Production for Games course! Here, you'll <strong>learn how to create custom tracks that fit your game perfectly</strong>. From retro adventure vibes to epic RPG boss battle bangers, you’ll craft tunes that level up your game’s atmosphere.</p><p><strong>Don’t worry if you’re starting from scratch</strong>. All you need is Reaper (a digital audio workstation), and we’ll hook you up with a sample and preset library to kick things off. No fancy studio? No problem. We’ve got you covered.</p><p>We’ll take you on a quest through four distinct music genres. First, you’ll create a retro adventure track. Then, dive into the deep with an underwater platformer tune. Feeling spooky? We’ll conjure up an atmospheric horror score. And for the grand finale: an epic RPG boss battle theme. Boom.</p><p>By the end, you’ll not only have killer tracks but also the<strong> skills to edit and prepare them for playback in your game engine of choice</strong>. Yes, we’re talking Unity, Unreal and Godot.</p><p>Stuck thinking, “But I’m not a musician” or “What even is a DAW?” Chillax. <strong>We’ll guide you through using Reaper to program virtual instruments and mix tracks like a pro</strong>. Whether you’ve got game engine skills or just a dream to make original music, this course is for you.</p><p>If the thought of writing music makes your palms sweaty (knees weak, arms are heavy. Vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti...), you’re not alone. That’s why <strong>we break everything down step-by-step</strong>, so you can start small and build big. No need to spit lyrics like Eminem —just bring your passion for gaming.</p><p>This course is <strong>perfect for aspiring game devs who want to add music to their skill tree</strong>. Maybe you’re a coder who’s curious about sound. Or a musician itching to compose for games. Whoever you are, we’re here to help you smash your goals.</p><p>So, ready to crank up the volume on your game? Let’s make some music that gets players hyped, scared, or maybe even teary-eyed. Grab your copy of Reaper, and let’s do this. <strong>Your game deserves a soundtrack that’s as epic as the adventure itself!</strong></p>",

This course is a beginner’s guide to learning the basics of computer science and creating your own engaging and interactive games.</span>  </p>  <p>  \t      You will learn how to make a character respond to input from your computer keyboard, and how to get onscreen objects to interact with each other in increasingly complex ways. Along the way, you will create more visual variety, more interactive possibilities, and have more fun.  </p>  <p>  \t<span>Following on from this, you’ll learn how to create a simple catch-and-avoid game, a ball-and-paddle “Breakout” game, a base-defence game, a point-and-click “escape the room” adventure game, and a maze game. You’ll learn to upload or create the artwork, how to control an onscreen object with a mouse, keyboard, or even by waving your hand in front of a webcam. We’ll also cover how to create some animation tricks, such as making a falling ball squish when it hits the floor, and making a character’s mouth move in synch with your own voice. Along the way, you’ll learn important computer science principles, such as if-then loops, iterative design, object-oriented programming, and debugging strategies.</span><br style=\"\">  </p>  <p>  \tWhether you are looking for a gentle introduction to computer science, a first step towards learning about the profession of computer programming, or you just want to have fun making games, this video course is here to help you at every step of the way.  </p>  <h4 style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">About the Author</strong></h4>  <p>  \t<span><strong style=\"\">Dennis G.

  "description": "<p>Hi, I’m <strong>Nik Lever</strong> and I’ve been working with the URP team at Unity since September 2021. In this course I’ll show you how to use <strong>Unity’s Universal Render Pipeline</strong> (URP).</p><p>In 2018, Unity released two new Scriptable Render Pipelines (SRPs): the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) and the Universal Render Pipeline (URP). At some stage URP will replace the Built-in render pipeline so it makes sense to <strong>learn how to use the new pipeline</strong>. I’ll show you how easy it is to customise the render using features of URP.</p><p>This course is intended to help Unity developers and technical artists get the best from the Universal Render Pipeline (URP). You’ll learn how to:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Set up URP for a new project, or convert an existing Built-in Render Pipeline-based project to URP.</p></li><li><p>How to set up lighting in URP</p></li><li><p>About shaders, and special effects for URP.</p></li><li><p>We’ll look at the callbacks in URP and how they differ from the Built-in Render Pipeline.</p></li><li><p>And we look at performance optimisation in URP, and more.</p></li></ul><p>As you’ll learn in this course using SRP architecture provides <strong>deep flexibility and customization</strong>, enhanced performance across the gamut of supported and future platforms, and <strong>quick iteration</strong> to unleash your creativity.</p><p><strong>Multiplatform deployment </strong>is a key factor in the success of many games. Players often play the same game on different devices, such as console and mobile, meaning Unity developers require rendering options that scale up and down for numerous devices, with as few steps and little complexity as possible. <strong>URP is a perfect solution.</strong></p><p>After several years of dedicated development, URP technology is now <strong>solid and production ready</strong>. This course will help you leverage its benefits for the successful development of your games. As I said, in the future the <strong>default pipeline for Unity will become URP</strong>, so it’s high time you understood this technology.</p><p>To work along with the course, you’ll need <strong>Unity 2021 LTS</strong> or more recent.&nbsp; The course resources come as two projects, <strong>URP Course – Complete</strong> and <strong>URP Course – Code Along</strong>. If you want to code along with the videos, then use the code along version. But, I’m guessing you worked that out already.</p><p><br></p><p>It's time to make the switch to URP and I'll make it as <strong>easy as possible</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Student feedback:</p><p>\"Been fumbling my way around URP on my own for a while. This course <strong>clarified a lot of things</strong> for me and introduced me to some new options and concepts. ... I<strong> learned a lot</strong>. More than I was expecting. And I definitely see myself coming back to sections of this course for reference in the future.\"</p><p>\"Great and <strong>deep course</strong>, including lots of subjects in quite some depth and never going easy on the student. I was hoping to get an overview over what URP was roughly about and instead got a deep dive that I never expected in such a short time, with lots of points for where to go next with web links, PDFs, docs and videos. <strong>Highly recommended!</strong>\"</p><p>\"<strong>Really useful information</strong> on Unity's URP. <strong>Well presented and clearly explained</strong> with lots of practical examples to work through.\"</p><p>\"This is an amazing God send. Knowledge is flowing!!! <strong>Awesome course</strong> for getting up to speed on URP in the modern age. The <strong>Teacher is an expert</strong> on the subject matter and if you follow the course you might be too.\"</p>",

Well look no further than this course. In this course you will learn how to go from nothing to a fully-fledged game that works on both Android and iOS. You will learn how to implement ads and Google Play services.

If any one get's to the middle the game is over. To eliminate these balls you must spin the wheel so the color on the wheel matches with the same colored ball, if this occurs you score one point. If you match correctly with a special ball you earn 2 points.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>AdMob ads</li><li>Google Play Services</li><li>Publish to Android App Store</li><li>Publish to Apple App Store</li><li>How to fix common Xcode errors when porting a Unity3D project to Xcode</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>This course is all about the creation of <strong>Visual Effects for Games </strong>with <strong>Godot Engine</strong>. It will take you from a Beginner standpoint to an Intermediate level in Game VFX. <br><br>We will begin with something easy like some <strong>Sparks </strong>so we can have an <strong>overview of how the Particle System </strong>works in Godot. <br><br>Then we will proceed to more elaborate abilities, like a <strong>blue mage Area of Effect </strong>and eventually a <strong>Fire Projectile</strong>. We will also see how to create variations for both of this magic abilities, like a Fire AoE and an Electric Projectile. Besides learning a lot about how the particle system works, you will also learn how to create shaders in Godot with the <strong>Visual Shader</strong> tool. <br><br><strong>Texture creation</strong> is also very important step when it comes to creating special effects for games, and on this course you will learn a lot about it. We will create hand-drawn textures with <strong>Krita</strong>, but a big portion of texture creation is done using node based tool called <strong>Material Maker</strong>, a fee and powerful substance designer alternative.<br><br>And at the very beginning we will have a <strong>theory chapter.</strong> Where we have a brief overview of the type of effect that most commonly exist, as well as a interesting view of the VFX Fundamentals, a great foundation of <strong>Realtime VFX</strong>.</p>",

Using <strong>Substance Designer</strong>, we will create 3 materials entirely from scratch which we can then add to our material library in <strong>Substance Painter</strong> for re-use later on any project we choose! Finally, we will use Blender and <strong>Marmoset Toolbag 4</strong> to capture excellent renders of our hard work to be able to show our friends, family and future employers exactly how great our game development skills are!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Learn Unity Game engine and C# by making a complete racing game. What can be more fun way of learning programming by making your own racing game? In this course we will start from scratch and at the end we will have a complete racing game developed. We will develop AI which will compete with players. You will learn how to make a virtual currency system in your game to buy and unlock cars. You will also learn how to implement unity ads in your game. We will implement reward ads which player will be able to watch to earn in game virtual currency. That is not all, there is lot more to learn in this course.</p><p><br></p><p>8 Gamedev &amp; Unity Essential Beginner Tips!</p><p><br></p><p>1. Don’t reinvent the wheel, use the built-in engine tools</p><p><br></p><p>When working on any engine, as Unity or Unreal Engine, some developers, mainly coming from a computer science field, can have a tendency to head down and start working on huge algorithms or structures without knowing if they already exist in the engine.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Google is your friend, documentation too</p><p><br></p><p>Once you start your game production up, you will encounter problems and lack experience in many things. When you do, your first reflex should be to look into the documentation.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Share your experience with others</p><p><br></p><p>Another great source of help and inspiration is of course other creatives, from your surroundings or on the internet. Indeed, game development as many other activities can take so many forms and projects that you’ll always have something to learn.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Do Game Jams</p><p><br></p><p>Game jams’ process isn’t classic game development but that’s all its force. Indeed, as it takes place during a really short and fixed period of time, you must prototype, think and decide quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>5. Constantly re-evaluate your work</p><p><br></p><p>Always remember to re-evaluate and criticize what your have created! With a fresh eye you can analyse your previous work, observe its forces and flaws, and improve it based on your new knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>6. Be organized and rigorous</p><p><br></p><p>Some people have an organized nature, and others not, but you must be rigorous and organized, otherwise you (or your team) may encounter trouble down the road.</p><p><br></p><p>7. Use versioning tools</p><p><br></p><p>Once you’ve settled down on your hierarchy and you’re ready to work, you should use a versioning tool to easily merge everyone’s work.</p><p><br></p><p>8. Plugins can save your life</p><p><br></p><p>Last but not least, use plugins! Especially when working on Unity, search in the Asset Store what plugins may be useful or even save your life!</p>",

In this course <strong>I’ll teach you how to use Unreal Engine 5’s Localization Dashboard</strong> to easily add translations to your game so you can reach a worldwide audience.</p><p><br></p><p>The best time to learn about localization is now. The earlier in development your game is, the better. <strong>There are a lot of pitfalls</strong> and design choices that developers make when they fail to plan ahead and develop their games with translation in mind. <strong>I’ll be sharing my real world experience</strong> from shipping multiple translated games and all the best practices and tips that can <strong>save you weeks of implementation time</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if you’re already midway through developing your game, or if it’s already finished, it is by no means too late to learn how to translate your project. My game My Beautiful Paper Smile was half way done when I learned about, and started making the game more translation friendly. Sure, it was a little more difficult than if I had already known all of the stuff in this course, but it was still well worth it!</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout the course I’ll teach you about the relevant <strong>Project Settings that are required to get your translations running properly</strong>, Walk you through <strong>setting up the localization dashboard to work with your project</strong>, demonstrate the two <strong>different methods for adding translated text into your project (and which one is best)</strong>, as well as how to <strong>set the active translation through Blueprint.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>If you’re looking for information on how to find companies, teams, or individuals to translate your game, I won’t be teaching that here.

  "description": "<p>Do you know&nbsp;<em>basic C# concepts, and know&nbsp;your&nbsp;way around loops, conditional statements, arrays, and very basics of object oriented programming</em>, but never really had a chance to incorporate any of it into a game project?. If that describes you, then this is a course for you.</p><p>Full disclosure: we won't be creating any earth shattering games. What we ARE going to be doing is LEARNING how to use with C# in game projects, and how to THINK like a game programmer.&nbsp;All games will use <strong>Winforms (Windows Forms)</strong> as the game board.</p><p>The goal of this course is three fold</p><ul><li><p>First, is to show you how things work</p></li><li><p>Second, help you understand how things work under the hood.</p></li><li><p>And third, to drill the basics so that they become a second nature to you.</p></li></ul><p>This course concentrates&nbsp;<strong>solely on creating game logic and algorithms in C#. </strong></p><p>We will use Windows Forms as the game board and we'll use&nbsp;events to code the application logic to. This way, we won't get distracted with million other little things that come into play when you try to learn the game programming and a framework such as Unity at the same time. Like I said, the goal here is to&nbsp;<strong>LEARN&nbsp;</strong>the basics, and to&nbsp;<strong>RETAIN&nbsp;</strong>the knowledge. What good is it for a beginner to game programming to watch someone build a complex game&nbsp;when three quarter of the stuff presented goes right over your head? Not in this course.&nbsp;</p><p>If you go through this course, and if you code along, I am absolutely sure that at the end, you will have great foundation to build on, and you will be able to move to more sofisticated applications and coding styles.</p><p>The course consists of four games, and more will be added later if there's enough interest.&nbsp;</p><p>The first is a <strong>Hungry Snake game.</strong></p><p>It's a great game to use to learn basics of drawing on the board, dynamic animated movement, collision, score keeping, dynamic changes to the game, key press events and more. You'll be surprised how little code is needed, yet at the same time, how much of all the mentioned concepts you will understand at the end of this section.</p><p>Second is a <strong>Bubble Breaker game.</strong></p><p>We'll get into details of defining a path for a selection triggered by a player's mouse click. I will show you both loop and recursive solution. We'll learn how to draw bubbles and paint them using gradient colors. You'll understand how 2D arrays relate to 2D x and y coordinates. We'll go into details of Graphics class of C#.&nbsp;We will make the game dynamic and allow for variety of bubble sizes and number of bubbles on the form.&nbsp;We will learn more about mouse events and how to branch the game logic based on user clicks. We will enhance the game with keeping the historical scores in a text file and allowing player to enter his/her score into the file. And in the process, you will not only learn game programming, but become a master of arrays, loops, and Enums.&nbsp;</p><p>Third is <strong>Pong game</strong>. (added June 2018)</p><p>A simple game that everyone is familiar with. But, we will go deeper, and I will show - and explain - how to move objects on the form, how to change direction of the movement upon detecting a collision, how to manipulate the speed of an object, how to generate new objects and keep track of their position in real time and much more!</p><p>Third is <strong>Brick Breaker (Arkanoid clone) game</strong>. (added August 2018)</p><p>A classic game with a little twist. Our version of the game features randomly placed bricks of random colors and sizes. We will also bounce the ball off the paddle based on what part of the paddle intersects with the ball - left part will bounce the ball to the left, right part to the right, and middle part straight up. Our scoring system will be based on brick colors and as the game progresses, the speed of the ball and paddle increases. And everything will be coded using OOP principles.</p><p>This whole course is designed as follow along course. Meaning, you are&nbsp;<strong>encouraged to code along with me</strong>. Everything is on the video, there are no code snippets being magically pasted into the Visual Studio. Also, I don't&nbsp;want you to just learn the concepts and then forget them a week later.&nbsp;<strong>I want you to remember and retain what you learn in this course.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>And let's face it - that is possible only when you code along.&nbsp;</p><p>And one more thing that makes or breaks learning to program -&nbsp;<strong>using what you learn, and using it frequently</strong>. Therefore, I code even the repetitive things from scratch and I don't simply just refer you to previous lessons. But that means, that some parts may feel slow and repetitive. However, if you actually code along, I guarantee you will learn, and also&nbsp;<strong>REMEMBER what you learned</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>But, If you prefer more instructional videos, that show everything once and move faster, then this course is NOT for you. Please keep that in mind before purchasing the course. I encourage you to watch some of the sample videos so you get a feel for the course structure, topic difficulty,&nbsp;and my teaching style.</em></strong></p><p>Now, I made the videos short and to the point. Most videos are only around 5 minutes long. That is deliberate, so each video is a small learning step that is easy to follow.</p><p>Alright, there's a lot of coding to be done. So let's code some games!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>UPDATE&nbsp; - Source is now 3.4 compatible!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>THIS COURSE&nbsp;GETS&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;BEGINNER&nbsp;TO&nbsp;ADVANCED&nbsp;AS&nbsp;FAST&nbsp;AS&nbsp;POSSIBLE</strong></p><p>This was designed to be a fast based course.&nbsp; Instead of bumping up the hours of the course, this course is designed to get you into advanced topics quickly. We start out with very beginning topics so even a new programmer can use this course, but we waste no time getting into advanced Godot topics.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm aware that many students search for courses with lots of hours in the hopes of equating it to more material. You will often find those courses will spend exhaustive time on basics and editor tools that are available in the community or on YouTube.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>THIS COURSE&nbsp;FOCUSES&nbsp;ON&nbsp;GAME&nbsp;ARCHITECTURE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;DESIGN</strong></p><p>While we begin with simple programming concepts the course continually refactors and improves the game architecture as new functionality is added. Learn how to create a sophisticated game architecture that involves products, cities, prices that can change by city, buying/selling, and of course a prototype of a pirate battle. Learn to use signals decouple objects and refine your game design. </p><p><strong>LEARN&nbsp;PROTOTYPING&nbsp;AND&nbsp;REFACTORING&nbsp;SKILLS</strong></p><p>This course follows the process you would use in real world iterative game design. We build simple prototypes that we can get up and running quickly. Then as we better define our gameplay we refactor and implement improved game architecture so we can add more features. The result is a course that will help you with any game you wish to build out.&nbsp; Finding the right balance between rapid progress and prototyping and creating a solid game architecture you can build on is a key to successful game design.</p><p><strong>FOR&nbsp;STUDENTS&nbsp;THAT&nbsp;DON'T&nbsp;WANT&nbsp;TO&nbsp;TAKE&nbsp;A&nbsp;30 HOUR&nbsp;COURSE&nbsp;TO&nbsp;LEARN&nbsp;ADVANCED&nbsp;TOPICS</strong></p><p>There are a lot of great courses on here but long 30 hour courses are not for everyone. Instead of lectures that spend a lot of time in theory,&nbsp; explaining the course itself, or exhaustively covering basic features you will find in other courses... this course just jumps in and starts building a fun Pirate Trading Game like Taipan. We start with very simple features like variables, creating functions, and using basic signals. But we quickly move right into the meat &amp; potatoes of what it takes to make a solid game architecture.</p><p><strong>LEARN&nbsp;TO&nbsp;SEPARATE&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;DATA&nbsp;OBJECTS&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;USER&nbsp;INTERFACE - And when it may not be worth the time</strong></p><p>This course takes a practical approach to building game prototypes. That said, there is a time when you must refine your game architecture and work to improve the design patterns you are using to build up your game. In this course we learn how to use signals, static methods, and dependency injection techniques to encapsulate your data making it easier to create far more robust game architectures. We also explore when it useful to break some of the rules in the interest of brevity and creating a working prototype. </p><p><strong>This course teaches you the skills you need so you can build games in a way that suits your own development style.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>CONSIDER&nbsp;MY&nbsp;IDLE&nbsp;TYCOON&nbsp;COURSE&nbsp;IF&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;ARE&nbsp;NEW TO&nbsp;GAME&nbsp;ARCHITECTURE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;DESIGN</strong></p><p>My other Godot course, Idle Business Tycoon course has a bit more simple game design and is likely more suitable to absolute beginners.</p><p><strong>See the power of Godot first hand</strong></p><p>You will see quickly why so many game developers are looking to Godot for their indie game projects. &nbsp;We create the project, the scene and begin scripting in the very first lecture!&nbsp;By the second lecture we are using lists to manage our cities. By the third lecture we are already using objects and building up a complex game architecture.&nbsp; </p><p>The engine is particularly well suited for games that are interface intensive. There are many user controls and they are very easy to script. </p><p>If you have ever wanted to learn Godot and enjoy pirate trading games like Taipan you are in luck. This course walks you through the design of making a Pirate&nbsp;Trading&nbsp;Game prototype from scratch. Step-by-Step. &nbsp;</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the \"<strong>Godot 4.x Canvas item Shaders</strong>\" course on Udemy! This course will guide you through the fascinating world of <strong>2D shaders</strong>, where you'll learn everything from the essentials to advanced techniques. <br><br>That being said, the series is split up between a beginner and an intermediate course. <strong>You are now looking at the first part of the series</strong>. It will take you <strong>from a beginner to intermediate in a matters of hours</strong>.<br><br>What makes this series unique is that it covers everything there is to know about 2D shaders in Godot 4. it's the most complete 2D shader series to date.&nbsp; It starts by teaching you the syntax and formatting rules following the community standards. Then you learn each concept with theoretical and practical examples, slowly building up from simple shaders to more advanced examples. It's also packed with \"try by yourself\" challenges to not just copy and paste the code but really learn how to do it on your own. <strong>The goal of this course is to teach you how to create any 2D shader you envision from scratch</strong>.<br><br>The content of the course is fully compatible<strong> with Godot 4.3! </strong><br><br>In this part of the series we'll start by exploring canvas item shaders, Godot's unique shading language, and look into <strong>essential data types</strong> like floats, integers, arrays, vectors, matrices, etc. You'll learn concepts like:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Color channels</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Texture mapping</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Uniforms</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Wrapping modes</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Formatting</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Built-in functions</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Hints</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>UV Coordinate system</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Fragment &amp; vertex functions</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Render pipeline</strong></p></li></ul><p>And more advanced topics like:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Pre-processing shaders</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Debugging-shaders &amp; -techniques</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Interaction with GDScript</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Randomness</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Animation Graphs (CurveTexture)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Interpolation</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Vector operations</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Branch divergence</strong></p></li></ul><p>And the list goes on and on. We will explore these topics through a blend of theory and practical coding exercises.<br><br>The course is structured to provide a <strong>comprehensive understanding of shader language</strong>. It exists out of two project, a project where we mostly focus on the theory and create random shaders that fit the subject, and we'll have a actual game project, our \"<strong>Zombie project</strong>\", this is where we learn to apply our knowledge to create visual effects (VFX) for your 2D games. We'll take a detailed look at every built-in shader function that we'll be using in our code, explaining every single line. Every time a new functionality is introduced, We'll have a full <strong>explanation using coding examples, slides and follow up questions</strong>. Plus, it's important to know that the <strong>course follows community best practices</strong>.<br></p><p><strong>By the end of this course</strong>, you'll not only have a <strong>solid foundation in shader programming in Godot </strong>but also a fun, interactive project to showcase your new skills. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enroll now</strong> to start our journey into the colourful world of shaders! <br><br><strong>Im happy to welcome you to the course!</strong><br><br>Kind regards,<br>Sam</p><p><br></p><p><em>As a final note:<br><br>At this point in time the second part of the series is still under development. I will be working on both this course to make sure it's up to date and the new course. This way you will be able to advance from intermediate to advance level once the second part is finished. <br><br></em><strong><em>Topics that will NOT be discussed</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>in this course</em></strong><em>, but will be included in the upcoming part 2 are: </em></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><em>Applying matrices on vertices</em></p></li><li><p><em>Screen space shaders</em></p></li><li><p><em>Canvas space shaders</em></p></li><li><p><em>Screen texture</em></p></li><li><p><em>Post-processing shaders</em></p></li><li><p><em>Advanced vector operations</em></p></li><li><p><em>Global uniforms</em></p></li><li><p><em>Coordinate space transformations using transform matrices (world to screen space, etc)</em></p></li><li><p><em>Back buffer copy</em></p></li><li><p><em>Advanced UV mapping</em></p></li><li><p><em>Light function </em></p></li></ul><p>And other advanced topics.

I'll teach you the key concept of that genre of game, including:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Finite State Machine</p></li><li><p>Using Blend tree</p></li><li><p>Looting coin when hitting a chest</p></li><li><p>Using keys to open locked doors</p></li><li><p>Creating caves</p></li><li><p>Creating a UI system displaying the number of lifes and coins</p></li><li><p>Creating a system of resources gathering</p></li><li><p>Creating an inventory</p></li><li><p>Creating a crafting system to create a new weapon</p></li><li><p>Switching weapons by pressing a key</p></li></ul><p>You can check the curriculum to learn more about the content of the course.</p><p>I'm focusing on making video that are straight to the point, giving you all the basics you need to understand key concept (while showing you how to use them) without overloading you.</p><p>Being a big fan of the Zelda series, it is a big blast for me to be able to teach you how to make a game of that genre, which is known to be quite difficult, but so rewarding and satisfying to play! At the end of this course, you will have a working RPG game prototype that you'll be able to develop, you will have learn the key concept of programming that type of game and - if you are a completely new to programming - you will have learn all the key concept of programming.</p><p><br></p><p>Then in the second part of this course you will learn how to create a simple 3D retro game. This is an introduction to 3D, by no mean a full blown course about how to create a full 3D game, but you will learn the following:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>How to import 3D assets</p></li><li><p>Dealing with animations</p></li><li><p>Creating sword attack</p></li><li><p>Creating enemy that can patrol, chase and attack the player</p></li><li><p>Creating state machine to handle complex behavior</p></li><li><p>Collecting coin and object</p></li><li><p>Display the number of life and coin collected</p></li></ul><p>And way much more. To have an overview, check the curriculum to see everything we are going to do together.</p><p>You don't need to have any prior experience, although a basic understanding of programming is a plus. I will teach you all the primary concept and explain you in details (without overloading you with no relevant concept) every line we are going to create for this game.</p><p>If all of this sounds like fun to you, enroll in this course and I'll see you in the first lecture!</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the second installment of the Complete Game Development Series, Project Infinite Runner! Throughout this course, we will delve into the fundamentals of Unity, the widely utilized game engine, as we construct a fully developed infinite-runner game.</p><p>Our journey begins with an exploration of the core aspects of the Unity editor, encompassing basic manipulation of objects, game objects and their components, the game loop, and asset importing. As the game takes shape, we will progressively explore advanced concepts such as the new input system, physics, animation controllers, prefabs, shader graphs, audio, and more.</p><p>This tutorial emphasizes thoroughness. No steps will be omitted, and we will refrain from relying on third-party code or plugins. Every element, including the player controller, world generation, shader graph, player profile, and leaderboard system, will be implemented from the ground up. Our goal is to maintain clean and extensible code throughout the entire process.</p><p>Beyond Unity, we will briefly touch on basic modeling using Blender to provide insights into other facets of the game development workflow.</p><p>Upon completing the tutorial, you will possess a robust understanding of Unity and game development, coupled with a comprehensive infinite runner project. This knowledge will empower you to tackle more advanced projects and progress through the series seamlessly. Brace yourself for a thorough, enlightening, and continuous game development journey!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Bonus: </strong>All assets used in this course are included for free.</p><p>Hi, and welcome to the Unity Game Analytics course, my name is Yohann and I'm famous for helping thousands of students makes apps and games and publish them to the app stores while some of my students's games reached the top 10 in iTunes and google play store.</p><p>This course is all about hands on training, if you're like me and like to learn by doing it yourself rather than listening to a teacher then this course is for you.</p><p><strong>About the course:</strong></p><p>By taking this course, you will learn how to integrate google analytics to any of your Unity games. Thanks to Unity and Google Analytics, you will be able to capture data about your users behavior and user engagement. Then you will be able to analyze this data and find ways to make your game more engaging which will ultimately increase your revenue.</p><p>For example, when you use analytics in your game, you can figure out if too many players stop playing a certain level in your game, maybe this level has a bug, or it's too hard or even to boring! By adding analytics to your game, you don't have to pray the gods to have users play your game, now you know how to improve your game based on real scientific data.</p><p>By the way, all the games out there like Minecraft, candy crush,&nbsp; and clash of clan, they all use analytics in their games.<br>\n</p><p>The course is broken down in short, easy to digest chunks. Now right at the beginning we go straight into downloading Unity and work on the captain rocket Unity project that's based on a game that is published in the app stores. You get to work on a real professional game, not just some random project. You can follow along whether you're using a Windows computer, Linux or Mac. We'll start with the basics of integrating analytics within your game then we'll go into advances topics such as tracking in-app purchases transactions, code exceptions, bugs, or the time a player spends on a level.</p><p>If you've never heard of any of these terms or never got to use them, then this mammoth course is for you.</p><p>As my current students already know, I'm always around in the forums and I'll be there to help you out whenever you get stuck. But you get a lot more than just the best Unity Analytics course available online. As a bonus you get a copy of the Captain Rocket source code that is a professional endless 2D platform runner that you can use any way you'd like.&nbsp; This bonus is worth well over $500.</p><p>Are you ready to be successful at mastering game analytics in Unity ? Then join this course now. you're gonna love it.</p><p>***</p><p><strong>What is Google Analytics?</strong></p><p><strong>Google Analytics</strong> is a freemium&nbsp; <strong>analytics</strong> service offered by <strong>Google, </strong>originally meant for website that tracks and reports website traffic. <strong>Google</strong> launched the service in November 2005 after acquiring Urchin. <strong>Google Analytics</strong> is now the most widely used web <strong>analytics</strong> service on the Internet.</p><p> The great thing about Google analytics, is that it's an all-in-one solution, it works for the web, for the Android smartphones and tablets, for the iPad, for the iPhone.</p><p>On top of that, Google Analytics can be combined with Google Admob advertising networks and Google Adwords too, which means you can analyze and gets pertinent reports about how your app is used as well as how the advertising within your app is working. You get analytics for banner ads, full screen ads, and also analytics for video ads (rewards too!)<br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why would you want to use Google Analytics in your Unity 3D game ?</strong></p><p>You need to understand and measure what your users do inside of your game — a key to engaging and monetizing users in the long run. You cannot expect to publish a game and cross your fingers or pray the gods that your game will make money. You need to analyze your user behavior and engagement and update your game to be more attractive and engaging for the game players.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Google Analytics allows developers to send raw user interaction data directly to Google Analytics servers. This allows you, the game developer to measure how users interact with their business from almost any environment. Developers can then use the data to:</p><ul><li><p>✅ Measure user activity in new environments.</p></li><li><p>✅ Tie online to offline behavior.</p></li><li><p>✅ Send data from both the client and server</p></li><li><p>✅ See how many players come daily to your game.</p></li><li><p>✅ Add custom events to track actions that players make on your game.</p></li><li><p>✅ See the results of custom events through the funnel.</p></li><li><p>✅ See where the players get stuck in your game and fix it</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Thanks to Unity 3D, you can now track user activity on iOS, Android, desktop games ( Windows or Mac or Linux ) Playstation and Xbox ! Even the Apple TV and the Virtual reality devices like Samsung VR and Oculus Rift ! It's it amazing?!</p><p><strong>Unity Analytics works seemlessly with Google Ads</strong></p><p>Have you ever wondered how games such as “Candy Crush” were able to become financially successful? Implement ads that the players would like to see using an ad network targeted specially for gamers, show only game related videos to your player and forget about the intrusive banner ads in this tutorial for intermediate users you will learn in no time how to monetize that free game you have.</p><p>Make revenue out of your game</p><ul><li><p>Target the right player audience with pertinent advertising.</p></li><li><p>Choose between showing ads that will reward the player or not.</p></li><li><p>Show an Ad to the player after he or she performs a specific action.</p></li><li><p>Navigate through the ads online dashboard to see the revenue of your game.</p></li><li><p>Make money out of your game without affecting the player's experience.</p></li></ul><p><br></p>",

You'll learn about:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Course Introduction<br></strong>This section of the course outlines the rest of the course material and introduces you to the tools with which you'll be working -- including how to get everything installed and running so you can write your first custom C# script.</li><li><strong>Programming Basics</strong><br>Become familiar with the foundational concepts of programming, including working with data in variables, calling methods, evaluating conditional statements and working with collections of data.</li><li><strong>C# Specifics</strong><br>Dive into object-oriented programming (the basis of C#), including how things like inheritance and polymorphism make classes more versatile. We'll also cover how to declare and define custom classes, and best practices when writing code in C#</li><li><strong>Unity-Specific Objects</strong><br>This section is a primer on the most commonly used objects that are unique to Unity's environment. It's an essential stepping stone to working with more complex features and classes in Unity</li><li><strong>How Scripts Communicate</strong><br>A program -- particularly one built in Unity -- is a network of various scripts communicating with each other to create an engaging system. Here, we'll cover all the ways that scripts can interact, using explicit commands, manual assignments or relying on events in Unity to connect essential components</li><li><strong>Going From Script to Scene</strong><br>Bring your scripts to life as we go in detail on how the classes we write interact with and inform the GameObjects they attach to in the game Scene. We'll also cover non-component elements like data classes and ScriptableObjects to expand our scripting toolkits.</li></ol><p>Course features:</p><ul><li><strong>Learn at your own pace:</strong> Every video is under 15 minutes long, and most are less than 10 minutes, so you can make progress at any time</li><li><strong>Illustrated concepts: </strong>In addition to hands-on exercises in most sections, lectures include visual aids to help describe advanced concepts</li><li><strong>Adaptable content:</strong> These core fundamentals will help you across all programming, not just a specific feature or project</li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>Want to <strong>make game levels using procedural generation</strong>? It's one of the most powerful ways to <strong>create infinite, dynamic game worlds</strong> without designing every single detail by hand.</p><p>Learn how to <strong>code your own algorithms</strong> and <strong>build replayable levels</strong> that feel fresh every time! No more designing every corner—let the code do the heavy lifting!</p><p>You'll start by generating a dungeon layout with rooms and hallways. Using Scriptable Objects, you’ll <strong>customise layouts effortlessly</strong>, making sure no two levels feel the same. Say goodbye to repetitive level design—your game world will evolve with every play-through.</p><p>Next, you’ll <strong>turn your 2D layouts into a fully realised 3D game level</strong>. We’ll harness the power of the Marching Squares algorithm to create detailed levels with only 16 tiles. If you’re a solo dev or working with a small team, this trick will save you heaps of time and effort.</p><p>Navigation is key, so we’ll dynamically generate a NavMesh at runtime.This means your player can <strong>seamlessly explore every new dungeon layout without breaking immersion</strong>. Whether you're building an RPG or a roguelike, this skill will come in handy!</p><p>But what's a dungeon without loot and baddies? Using a rule-based system, you’ll <strong>populate your levels with treasure, enemies, and decorations</strong>. You’ll also learn techniques to prevent everything from looking too repetitive—because variety keeps players engaged.</p><p>Along the way, we’ll <strong>level up your C# skills</strong> with advanced concepts like lambda expressions, expression-bodied members, and System.Linq. If you've got the basics of C# down and want to push your coding skills further, you’re in for a treat.</p><p>This course is perfect for anyone who knows their way around Unity’s UI, GameObjects, and Prefabs. If you can handle loops, classes, and variables in C#, you're ready to level up your skills with procedural generation.</p><p>By the end of this course, you’ll have a robust system for procedural level design, plus a sharper understanding of advanced C# concepts. Ready to <strong>apply these techniques to your own projects </strong>and build infinite game worlds? Let’s dive in and start coding!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Do you want to make your first fully functioning game but feel overwhelmed by coding?</strong> Well, don’t worry — this course is designed exactly for you!</p><p>In this <strong>hands-on, beginner-friendly course</strong>, you'll learn how to create a complete <strong>First Person Shooter (FPS)</strong> game using <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong> and <strong>Blueprints</strong> — Unreal’s powerful visual scripting system that lets you build games without writing a single line of code .</p><p><br></p><p>You’ll create a <strong>zombie survival game</strong>&nbsp; where enemies chase you and attack in waves, testing your skills as you fight to survive. The game will feature <strong>7 switchable weapons</strong>, each with its own purpose and personality:</p><p> <strong>AK-47</strong> — the iconic assault rifle, reliable, fast, and perfect for mowing down enemies at medium range.<br> <strong>USP Pistol</strong> — a sleek, semi-automatic sidearm for when you need quick backup and precise shots.<br> <strong>AWP Sniper Rifle</strong> — slow but deadly, perfect for picking off zombies from a distance with one powerful shot.<br> <strong>Axe</strong> — when the ammo runs out, nothing beats the raw satisfaction of getting up close with a heavy melee weapon.<br> <strong>C4 Explosive</strong> — plant it, step back, and enjoy the chaos as you blow up groups of enemies.<br> <strong>First Aid Kit</strong> — your lifeline in the heat of battle, quickly restoring health when things get rough.<br> <strong>Flashlight</strong> — not every good thing is in plain sight; light up dark areas and uncover valuable assets.</p><p><br></p><p>Each weapon comes with its own <strong>custom-made animations</strong>&nbsp; for shooting, reloading, and equipping — all of which we’ll create together inside Unreal Engine 5. We’ll also add <strong>ammo pickups</strong>, <strong>win and lose conditions</strong>, <strong>impact visual effects</strong>, and <strong>ragdoll effects</strong> to bring the world to life .</p><p><br></p><p>This course is organized into <strong>three structured sections</strong>, designed to take you from complete beginner to building your own playable game step by step:</p><p> <strong>Section 1: Unreal Engine &amp; Blueprint Basics</strong><br>We’ll start with the foundations. You’ll learn how to navigate <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong>, understand the basics of <strong>Blueprints</strong>, and create your first simple game functionalities without writing any code. We’ll also import all the assets we need for our project, so everything is ready for development.</p><p> <strong>Section 2: Unreal Engine Animation Framework</strong><br>In this section, you’ll dive into Unreal’s animation system. You’ll learn how animation assets work, and more importantly, we’ll create the animations we need for our game ourselves. That includes equip, fire, and reload animations for each weapon, so you won’t depend on any external animation packs — everything will be built from scratch.</p><p> <strong>Section 3: Putting It All Together</strong><br>This is where it gets exciting! We’ll combine everything we’ve built and bring the game to life. You’ll learn how to set up <strong>weapon switching</strong>, <strong>shooting and reloading mechanics</strong>, <strong>enemy AI</strong>, the <strong>game HUD</strong>, and a <strong>wave-based game mode</strong>. We’ll also implement <strong>win and lose conditions</strong>, and finally, <strong>package the project</strong>, so you have a complete, polished game ready to play or showcase.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Computer programmers are the unsung heroes of the modern world. From smartphones to laptops, traffic systems to bank cards, their hard work touches almost every aspect of our lives. Behind each technological advance is a team of creative coders.</p><p>Over the past 30 years, computer games have become one of the most exciting and popular areas of the entertainment industry to work in. Becoming a game programmer takes creative talent to help to create the story, graphics, music, and characters you need for your games, and the technical know-how brings them to life. Who knows? This course could be the very first step on your journey from gamer to game maker.</p><p>This course uses a programming language call Python, a fairly simple text-based language, and is perfect for kids and beginners, or as a step up from Scratch. However, unlike Scratch, it is not a purpose-built language to teach coding. Python is the world's fastest-growing programming language and one of the most widely used professional programming languages in the world among software engineers, mathematicians, data analysts, scientists, accountants, and even kids. In fact, it should be the first programming language to learn.</p><p>The best way to learn any new language is to get stuck in, and programming languages are no different. Building your own computer games is a fun and immersive way to combine theory and practice. This course is divided into thirteen classes, starting from the basics of Python to building complex games that are enjoyable to learn, and fun to play. </p><p>In this course, we will use Pygame Zero, a Python library built around the famous and long-lived Python game engine, Pygame for all our game projects. Pygame Zero takes away the complicated interface required by Pygame so that I could focus on the teaching and you could focus on the learning of the gist of Python programming.</p><p>In total, we will build eleven games in this course, and each of them is treated as a separate game project and is designed in such a way that you will be able to apply and practice the programming concepts and ideas that you have learned in the previous projects into the current one, plus the new techniques in the current project to bring your skills to the next level. So, by the end of this course, you should be able to master the fundamental elements of Python programming.</p><p>In the last section of the course, there are nine lessons on the introduction to object-oriented programming in Python, the most used programming methodology in the software development world.&nbsp;This section is designed to prepare you for the next level of Python programming.</p><p>This course will help you start an incredible adventure into the world of programming. Most importantly, have fun while learning, once you have completed the games, you can show them off to your friends and I hope you enjoy playing them as much as I enjoyed creating them for you.</p><p><strong>This course is intended for purchase by adults.</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>By now everyone has heard about Virtual Reality games. We are at the beginning of a new era where people are immersed into virtual worlds and they get to be or do anything they wish.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Now is the time to start making virtual reality games. This is what this course will teach you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you have no experience making games with Unity or you are a seasoned developer, this course will get you up and running in no time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will be shown how to start making VR games from scratch and publish them in the Apple app store and Google Play store. All steps are shown to you so you have all the chances to succeed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, this course is also meant for people that already have existing Unity projects and would like to quickly turn them into VR games.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The future of gaming is exciting thanks to Virtual Reality.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Don't be left behind. Join us now.</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> This course is part of a the world's one and one series on Unity professional multiplayer games.</p>\n\n<p>The content is so big, it couldn't fit in one course. Here is the courses are split in key areas:</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many tutorials, guides and courses out there, that it’s hard to know how to start learning how to code, game development, and even harder to know in which order you should take the courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve decided to focus on Unity rather than other platforms because the team behind Unity has a great vision. They are always on top of things. Each time a new device comes out, they add support for it and also create special libraries for it. We believe you should focus on Unity as well. We want to make sure you do by providing you the best learning material at the best prices</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Oculus Rift and Samsung VR are fully operational on Unity 5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unity also entered the live cinematic world (animated movies, think Toy Story). The future is bright for Unity developers. (more about the future of Unity  )</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also been a change in the mobile app app store category ranking system which makes it harder to get app exposure for new apps. It means developers need to focus on a few apps instead of bombarding the app store with reskins. Nowadays, an app is a continuous work of art where developers need to listen to the users and keep updating the app to give them exactly what they want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having said that, you will maximize your learning experience if you takes the courses in the following order:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>- Understand the process of making games:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before even getting started into developing, you need to understand the whole process of making games, from A to Z. Take the “<strong>Captain Rocket</strong>” course where you get to see how a Unity project gets reused and turned into another game and gets published to iTunes app store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>course: <strong>Publish Captain Rocket* iPhone game under 2 hours, Unity 5</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Learn the basics:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course “<strong>Begin Unity Programming</strong>” is short (about 45 minutes) and entertaining where you will learn keys Unity concepts and code using Star Wars figurines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important course is “<strong>Fundamentals of Programming</strong>“. Beware! This course goes over the hard stuff of programming. It’s explaining the mechanics used in programming, just like you would get in a computer science class in the American Ivy league Universities. It’s not for everyone, but it should be taken by EVERYONE. You need to understand what are for / while loops, what’s the difference between an int, a float or a double, and what are the principles of object oriented programming (to name a few key concept). The course comes with plenty of mind-stimulating exercises made with the new elegant language named Swift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>- Get comfortable with using Unity’s user interface: course <strong>\"Introduction to Game Development with Unity\"</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unity Editor can be overwhelming at first with all its windows, sub windows and tabs. Luckily, this course guides you through it. Oh, i forgot to mention, it’s free!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Learn how to create graphics to use in your game: <strong>\"3D Pixel Art for non artist. Crossy Road Modeling. Unity 3D\"</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graphic assets can be 2D illustrations, 3D graphics, sprites, voxel art (MineCraft like) or also sound effects and Unity bundles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend to start making graphic assets following the course<strong> “3D Pixel Art for non artist. Crossy Road Modeling. Unity 3D“</strong>. Why? Because it’s a course that allows anyone to make decent game graphics without having to be an artist! With the correct tools and the right guidance, you will end up making 3d pixel graphics (voxel) art just like Crossy road or MineCraft by the end of the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you know how to create 3D assets, it’s time you learn how to make 3D characters, animate them, and import them into Unity to use them!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will learn all of the above in the course named “<strong>3D Pixel Characters Modeling &amp; Animations for all. Unity 3D</strong>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, the tools used in the course are all free to use, that’s the cherry on the cake!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of the course, you will be able to create and animate characters like Spiderman, Ironman and wonder woman. Make Ironman dance hip-hop is hilarious and gratifying!</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>- Learn core Unity development:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, you must be antsy to create a game. Contrary to most online courses, the following course allow you to create and also PUBLISH the game you’re making to the Google Play store and the iTune app store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the “<strong>Unity 3D 2016 – Build, program &amp; publish Crossy Road game</strong>” course. Learn about key concepts, must-have scripts to get a professional game like Crossy Road and get it out the door into the wilderness of the app stores! I can’t stress enough the joy of having your game out in the app store where all your friends and family are amazed by you owning a piece of the app stores! (scoring social points!)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you’ve got your first game in the app store, you should learn how to make more complex games, that are using 3D animations, physics, vehicles, shooting, and character Artificial Intelligence. The perfect course for these topics is “<strong>Unity 2016 – Build , program and publish a 3D shooter game</strong>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>- Enhance your game development skills:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s time to learn specific game mechanics that will improve the player’s game experience and ultimately get more user engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to know how to add multiplayer to your game. A game that’s using the multiplayer mechanics is a more demanded type of game because players prefer to play against / with other players rather than computer simulated AI (Artificial Intelligence).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course “<strong>Unity Multiplayer 2016 – Build Online Shooter – code included</strong>” is the perfect way to turn the game you’ve learned how to make (the 3D shooter game) into a multiplayer game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to most courses, you’re not wasting time on creating code to make the game, but you will be focusing on jumping straight into the multiplayer functionality. This is a must-have course and one that I am the most proud of because “multiplayer” is a hard concept and I finally got to find the simplest way so that anyone can add multiplayer to any Unity games.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Equipping characters with weapons, gears and trinkets</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of multiplayer games allow players to pickup items, find treasures and get loot from bosses. Now the hard part for the game developer is to know how to pickup these items, equip these items, remove them, swap them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And all of this needs to be done in multiplayer,… meaning, when a player equip a new item such as a sword or a helmet, all other players need to see that new state. Not so easy at all… That’s why this course is a must: \"<strong>Unity 2016 - Character gear and weapon use</strong>\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Inventory system for single player and multiplayer games:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>unity-inventory-system-for-games-multiplayer-online</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you understand how to pickup items and equip them, you need an inventory system to keep track of which item the player owns. Many games call this a stash or a backpack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds simple to implement, but it’s tough, especially in multiplayer games. Oh, almost forgot to mention, the user interface needs to work on all screen sizes, small screens like Android phones and iPhones, as well as big TV screens for PCs. This course will teach you every single details. And yes, the code is included!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\"Unity 5 - Inventory System for Professional Games\"</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>- Item attributes and statistics </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you can get into player fighting, dueling and combat, you need to setup stats and attributes on each items and players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, swords have a specific strength, intelligence, dexterity, mana cost and other skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course teaches you how to set these attributes up and how to use them during combat to compute what’s the damage taken or mitigated. It’s also great to create character leveling and experience gaining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"<strong>Unity 2016 - RPG Character Stats and Item Attributes System</strong>\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Mastering Melee and Ranged weapon mechanics</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good game needs melee weapons such as swords, knives, or axes,  and also needs ranged weapons such as guns, bows with arrows and such.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn the mechanics and get to apply them hands-on with the source code that comes with the course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>range-and-melee-weapons-course-unity</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"<strong>Unity 5 pro multiplayer combat using melee &amp; ranged weapons</strong>\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>- Turn your game dev into a game business:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s fun to make games but it’s even more fun when games bring in money. No seriously, if you plan on just making games for fun, that’s fine, but many of you would love to turn this hobby into a business so that you can keep doing what you love without having to go find another job to pay the bills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how can you monetize your game?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add advertising banners and full screen ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course “<strong>Unity 3D 2016 – Build, program &amp; publish Crossy Road gam</strong>e” has an advanced section on how to integrate Unity ads to your game. This is a good start but it’s not enough, you need to add a video reward system where players have to watch a 30 second video advertisement to get virtual coins in return. Each time a player watches a video, you get a few cents to a couple dollars, especially if the player downloads and opens the app from the advertisement! Now, that’s what we call potentially good income! The developer from Crossy Road used this exact same system and made a couple million dollars in a week or so. Now I’m not saying this is going to happen to you, but do you really need this much money to keep you going?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unity Game Boost: Build a Video Reward System</strong> (bring in $$$)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to monetize a game is to use virtual coin systems where players can earn, buy and use coins to get virtual items and goods. The player will buy virtual coins with real money using the in-app purchase in-game store. There is a course just for that: “<strong>Unity Game Boost: Coin Management System</strong>“. The course drive you through every single step to create the virtual coin system and store/ retrieve the player’s coin amount. Then you get to create an in-game store so that player can buy virtual good with real money. The beauty of this course is that you learn how to bundle the coin system so that you can reuse it in every game you make in no time. A must-have course!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Listen to this scenario, it’s the most common one for game developers: You’ve made a decent game, you published it, you get a couple hundred downloads and then “dead silence”. You can keep praying the Gods for help or you can help yourself and add Unity Analytics to your game. Thanks to analytics, you get a report on key metrics in a nice online dashboard. You get answers to key questions. such as</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is my game to hard or too easy? Which level has the most players quit? Which character gets selected the most? How many times a level gets played?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the course \"<strong>Unity Game Analytics</strong>\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have all these questions answered, you modify your game to fit the player’s feedback, it’s time to understand how to add fun stuff using physics mechanics. The perfect course for this is “<strong>Unity Game Physics</strong>”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, it takes time and experience to get to understand how to read your audience and know what they want. It’s great to get real data from your players and analyze them. Data scientists are in high demand. Some game companies are really good at this and came up with a p behavioral system that forces players to have the desire to spend money in the game. Critics like Nick Saint of Business Insider have said that Zynga’s games have essentially the same mechanics even though they have different premises and settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also need to create an audience so that each time you create a new game or add a new level or feature to an existing game, you need to be able to tell people about it. That’s why you need to build an email list. The email list is platform agnostic, meaning, no matter what happens tomorrow, even if the iPhone industry dies, you still have an email list of people who love to play your game genres, and they will gladly follow you to any platforms, whether you decided to create Virtual Reality games, ebooks or movies!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course “<strong>Unity 2016 – Email List Building – Why and How</strong>” will help you integrate the email capture system into your game and help you build your email list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Email list building with Unity</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>- The marketing side of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disclaimer: Would you rather take the time to market your game or start making another game?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all rather keep making games than marketing the games we’ve already made and that’s totally understandable. Making games is fun and gratifying. Marketing games is not sexy, nobody wants to have to bother people and tell them about your game. After all, shouldn’t your game be good enough that it speaks for itself? not in today’s world. Publishing a game is just the beginning, creating the buzz around it, baking viral mechanics into it, getting featured in magazines and media is a must. The course “<strong>Become a Mobile App Growth Hacker . Total Theory &amp; Training</strong>” teaches you fundamentals concepts on how to use marketing even before you’ve created your game. Making a game is great, making a game that brings in revenue is great, and making a game that the whole world enjoys is even better!</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>- Chat system:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Players want to interact with eachother. Online games need chat systems to allow players to send messages to eachother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The messages need to be stored in your own private server (online or local). This course will teach you just that. Beware! This course uses advanced topics like MySQL, PHP, and Apache. The good news is that all the source codes are included so you just have to use them and customize them to make it original to your taste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take this course \"<strong>Unity 5 Build a chat system for online multiplayer games</strong>\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>- in-game mail message system</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course goes hand in hand with the course above(chat system). If somehow one of the player is not online at the moment, other players can send in-game emails. A must-have for online multiplayers. \"<strong>Unity 5 Multiplayer InGame Mail Messaging</strong>\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Maths for Game Developers:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>okay, let’s be honest, making games is sexy, learning the maths not so much. But don’t you want to understand the math behind the game mechanics?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take this somewhat boring but necessary course: \"<strong>Maths for Video Games</strong>\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>- You don’t have time or don’t want to spend too much money on graphics?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me either.. That’s why the following course automatically generate environments, dungeons, castles, houses, weapons and entire worlds for you! Neat? very powerful stuff…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"<strong>Building 3D Voxel Art Environment Worlds with Unity 5\"</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"<strong>Unity 5 techniques to generate unique worlds quickly</strong>\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"<strong>Unity 5 Build a System that Generates Houses &amp; Castles Auto</strong>\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"<strong>Build Weapons Automatically Unity . Fantasy Edition</strong>\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have taken all the above courses. You are ready to make a 6-figure job as a game developer or run your own game business.

  "description": "<p>Hi, and welcome to the Unity Game Physics course, my name is Yohann and I'm famous for having enabled my students to make games that reached the top ranks in the itunes app store. My courses have hundreds of 5 star reviews on Udemy alone.</p><p>This course is all about hands on training, if you're like me and like to learn by doing things yourself rather than listening to a teacher rambling on theory then you're going to like this course.</p><p>About the course:</p><p>Whether you're a beginner at making games or not, I will show you how to master game physics just like it's done in professional games. Physics is everywhere, sometimes you don't even know it 's there but trust me it is, it's used in most games.<br></p><p>The course is broken down in short, easy to digest chunks. Now right at the beginning we go straight into downloading Unity and work on a project that's based on a game that is published in the app stores. You get to work on a real game, not just some random useless project. You can follow along whether you're using a Windows computer, Linux or Mac. We'll start with the basics of physics and then move to advanced techniques like <strong>colliders, rigidbodies, triggers, area effectors, fixed joints, hinge joints, raycasting, forces, torques, and even buoyancy! </strong>The cool thing is that you don't need to take a physics class nor a game class, it's all in here.</p><p>If you've never heard of any of these terms or never got to use them, then this mammoth course is for you.</p><p>As my current students already know, I'm always around in the forums and I'll be there to help you out whenever you get stuck. But you get a lot more than just the best Unity Physics course available online. As a bonus You get a copy of the Unity source code of the Crossy road game clone called Dangerous Lanes that's a famous 3D isometric pixel game. You also get a copy of the Captain Rocket source code that is a fun endless 2D platform runner that you can use any way you'd like. And as a bonus, you get lots of characters and environment object that you can use freely to make your upcoming game look professional. This bonuses are worth well over $500.</p><p>Are you ready to be successful at mastering game physics? Then join me on this exciting journey. Become part of this whole new world of learning skills and fun. The future's bright with Unity Game Physics, you're gonna love it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is game physics ?</strong></p><p>Computer animation physics or game physics involves the introduction of the laws of physics into a simulation or game engine, particularly in 3D computer graphics, for the purpose of making the effects appear more real to the observer<br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why use Unity 3D to learn about physics in video games ?</strong></p><p>Unity Technologies is shaping a booming global games market and has seen escalating uptake of the Unity engine and its complementary and integrated game promotion, user retention and analytics services.</p><p>The Unity engine is the mamoth in game dev and by far and away the dominant global game development software. More games are made with Unity than with any other game technology. More players play games made with Unity, and more developers rely on our tools and services to drive their business.</p><p>Also Unity 3D is free for personal use, so there is no reason not to use it!

  "description": "<p>This course tackles the hot topic of \"virtual reality\". This tutorial is not a guide to implementing a specific game, it rather gives you the tools and knowledge to implement your own VR games. Unlike other courses about the oculus rift, this course does not stop after the setup. We take a look at the things that really matter for VR development. Without wasting time we quickly proceed with interesting and important topics that go beyond setting up a simple character to walk around in VR. Besides using the headtracking for shooting objects, we see how raycasting can be used to analyse and trigger functions at an object which is being looked at. Further topics are dealt with, such as user interfaces and more. Get a head start by taking this course.</p><p><br></p><p>In the course, we take a look at different techniques that are crucial to VR development, such as:</p><p>-using the headtracking for aiming and shooting</p><p>-raycasts to analyse an object which is being looked at</p><p>-retrieve the world point, at which the player is looking to send a character there</p><p>-teleport the player to visit interesting sites of a model</p><p>-various controls for user interfaces (look based input and more)<br></p><p>The length of the course is about 1 hour, but as the course is rather dense, you will get much more content than you would expect from an hour long tutorial.<br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>*** More Content Is Being Added To The Course •••</strong></p><p>This is Volume 2 in my Most Comprehensive Guide To Unity Game Development series. If you are interested to enhance your Unity skills then read further.</p><p>As in all of my courses, this course is also project based. Simply put, the best way to learn is to actually create a game that is playable on any device, and this is what I preach in all my courses.</p><p>Since this is an intermediate course we will not cover the basics of programming with C# and how to use Unity, instead, we will dive deeper into C#&nbsp;coding practices and learn how to solve complex problems with simple logic. </p><p>As we go through the projects I&nbsp;will show you multiple ways how to solve the problem at hand and I will compare different ways and talk about the pros and cons of each and why and when should you use one way over the other.</p><p>The main focus of this course is to help you think like a programmer and gain strong problem solving skills. Because in 99% of the times in any project you will solve problems by using simple logic instead of complex algorithms, and this is what this course is about.</p><p>And not only that, but I&nbsp;will explain to you how to optimize your games from the very start so that you avoid the most common optimization heavy mistakes that not only beginners make when they create their games.</p><p>Every section in this course will gradually increase in size and depth so that you always learn new things and face new challenges.</p><p>During the lectures, I&nbsp;will give you assignments to challenge your knowledge and to challenge your ability to think like a programmer. Because in game development, the best way to learn is by doing. Of course, I&nbsp;will provide a solution for every assignment that I&nbsp;give you, but I will expect that you try to finish it on your own because it will give you experience, and the feel of how to solve programming problems on your own and it will help you implement and retain everything that I am teaching you in the course.</p><p><strong>You will also benefit from my super fast response if you have any issue that you are stuck with, and oh and all the students taking the course will also be there to help you!</strong></p><p>Some of the things that you will learn in this course:</p><ul><li><p>Intermediate, And Advanced C# Programming</p></li><li><p>Basic AI(Artificial Intelligence)</p></li><li><p>Advanced AI(Artificial Intelligence)</p></li><li><p>Basic And Advanced Character Animations</p></li><li><p>Sound FX And Music</p></li><li><p>Learn How To Use Unity's UI System</p></li><li><p>Create And Animate Menus</p></li><li><p>Saving And Loading Game Data</p></li><li><p>Basic And Advanced Animations</p></li><li><p>Creating Reusable Code</p></li><li><p>Writing Optimized Code</p></li><li><p>Generate Procedural Levels</p></li><li><p>Create Object Poolers For Enemies, Obstacles And Levels</p></li></ul><p><strong>That And Much More Is Awaiting You In This Course</strong></p><p>If You ever had an idea for an awesome game, then enroll in this course and learn the tools that you need to develop Your next hit game!!!</p><p><strong>What Is Your Risk By Taking This Course?</strong></p><p><strong>Nothing!!

  "description": "<p>This course continues the development of the 2D game from the Intro to Game Development using Unity - Part I course and you'll learn how to use more of the powerful built-in capability that Unity has by adding <strong>exciting features</strong> to your game.</p><p><strong>Physics, particle systems, audio, animations, scoring</strong> - these topics may seem complex, but the step-by-step approach in this this course makes them <strong>easy to understand</strong>. You'll be flying the bird with simple taps (mouse clicks) to catch the worm, and avoid colliding with other game objects along the way. And the fun you'll have by adding a flying animation to the bird and implementing sparks when it hits an obstacle will bring added&nbsp; excitement to the game while adding to your game development skills.</p><p>Most of the scripting to implement these advanced features is done with <strong>just a few lines of code!</strong> Once you're finished with this super fun course, you'll be <strong>fully prepared</strong> to understand the vast amount of documentation and tutorials available on Unity to take your game development skills to the <strong>next level</strong> if you choose to do so. You'll also be ready to rapidly launch into learning the exciting world of <strong>Augmented, Virtual, and Mixed Reality (AR/VR/MR)</strong> development and more.</p><p>(BTW, the 2D game developed in this series is based on the <strong>Flappy Worms</strong> game on Google Play).</p>",

A careful structure must be created to ensure that the animations do not cut of jump between each other.</p><p><br></p><p>This Course will show you how to make a third person controller in Godot from scratch. We’ll go from blank canvas, to capsule, to full control rig and finally a weapon controller. I will show you how and explain why I am making the decision I’m making. Because when you’re making such a complicated controller there isn’t one right way to do it. So I will tell you what I’m doing it and why, occasionally talk about alternatives and then we can move on. Nothing is skipped. Aside from collecting animations, I have included every single decision I made along the way.</p><p><br></p><p>We will create:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>A Camera Controller.</p><ul><li><p>Using Spring Arms, we will be able to rotate around our character, without clipping into walls.</p></li><li><p>Using Tweens, we will be able to switch which side we view the character from.</p></li><li><p>Using Tweens, we will be able to Zoom the camera to better aim our weapons.</p></li><li><p>We will also make sure all of these actions can happen smoothly.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A Node Based Finite State Machine.</p><ul><li><p>We Will Create a State machine which will ensure our actions are clearly defined and have clear rules about what can be triggered and when.</p></li><li><p>We have a state machine for both Combat and Non combat enabling you to design dynamic play modes depending on your desires.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A Full Third Person&nbsp;Character Rig and Animations.</p><ul><li><p>Using Blender and Mixamo we will create a rig with a complex set of animations.</p></li><li><p>We will discuss importing a rig into Godot.</p></li><li><p>How to use the Animation Tree Player.</p></li><li><p>Create a complex set of transitions and blends to ensure that each is smooth and seamless.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A Weapon Manager.</p><ul><li><p>Create a dynamic weapon manger.</p></li><li><p>using classes and components create a system that will allow a diverse number of different weapons and projectiles.</p></li><li><p>Picking up Ammo and Weapons.</p></li><li><p>Dropping Weapons.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>We Will also cover Inverse Kinematics</p><ul><li><p>Ensure the player is always looking down camera</p></li><li><p>Adjust the weapon position to better suit the character pose</p></li><li><p>Make sure the left hand is always on the weapon</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Thank you for checking out this course and I look forward to seeing work through this project and creating an amazing game.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Improve your coding skills by learning Object Oriented Programming and how to apply it in Unity. </p><p><br></p><p>All the theory is explained on game-related examples and next we use a Hands-On project - a prototype of a 2D Shoot 'Em Up game to learn how to apply what we have learned in a Unity project.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you find it difficult to add new Enemies, Weapons or new Game Mechanics to your game? Do you spend more time fixing bugs than actually testing the new feature that was meant to take you few minutes to add? If so I bet that you will benefit a lot from learning OOP!</p><p><br></p><p>Instead of talking about generic concepts like Animal-Dog or Person-Employee we will use <strong>game-related examples</strong> like implementing different weapons to your game or how to add multiple different enemies to your project.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>This course is made out of 2 parts:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Theory Part:</strong></p><p>In Section 1 I will explain WHAT is Object-Oriented programming:</p><ul><li><p>Encapsulation</p></li><li><p>Abstraction</p></li><li><p>Inheritance</p></li><li><p>Polymorphism</p></li><li><p>*We will also talk about composition and why \"prefer composition over inheritance\" is a GOOD advice.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Practical Part:</strong></p><p>NEXT we will work on a HANDS-ON project by implementing new features and seeing HOW&nbsp;and WHY to apply OOP solution. We will explore why a prototypical code will fail when we want to expend our game with new features and I will show you HOW to use OOP to enable us to easily add new weapons, enemies and other features that we want to have in our game.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no way to learn OOP just by exploring theory. You need to PRACTICE and explore some game dev related examples to get a feel for how to apply OOP in your code ?</p><p><br></p><p>We will tackle the most common game dev tasks:</p><ul><li><p>Adding different weapons to your game</p></li><li><p>Adding a new game mechanic</p></li><li><p>Making tour code more component-based</p></li><li><p>Adding a new enemy</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>What you can expect from the course: </strong>?</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>5h of video content</strong></p><p>Learning OOP can be done only through practice. After you watch the theory (Section 1) I have prepared few example problems related to Game Dev so that you can PRACTICE what you have learned.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>A Fully working Shoot'em up game prototype</strong></p><p>Theory (WHY) is useless if you don't know how to apply it in practice.</p><p>I have prepared a working prototype of a small game that we will refactor so that you can learn HOW to use OOP and WHEN to do it.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Project files and scripts</strong></p><p>For each video where we write some code I will provide a github link so that you can view the changes in the code as well as my full project that you can open in unity to find any issue / difference / bug that you might have.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>My help</strong></p><p>If you don't understand something just ask here in the comment section or on courses <strong>Discord channel</strong>. I do my best to daily answer any question.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>30-Days refund policy</strong></p><p>If you don't enjoy the course let me know and I will issue a refund if you are within the 30 days from the date that you made the purchase.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Sunny Valley Studio has already helper more then 4350 students in addition to almost 10 000 subscribers on my YouTube channel to improve there C# coding skills and there knowledge about Unity by showing how to make 2D Platformer, a Juicy 2D shooter game or a 3D Survival game as video courses. On YouTube you can find everything from how to create Minecraft-like voxel world, a turn-based 2d game or an inventory system. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Hi! I'm Peter</strong> and will be your instructor. </p><p>I am passionate about programming and Unity (<strong>worked for about ~5 years as a programmer / unity dev</strong>) and I will do my best to help you to develop game dev and programming skills that you can use to make your own games or to get a job in a game dev studio as a programmer )</p><p><br></p><p>See you in the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Important! To following along with this course you must own playMaker. It can be purchased on the Unity Asset Store!  It is also one of the best Unity Assets you will find. </strong></p><p>This game design was inspired by some of the most popular Life Simulator Games. Specifically, in this course we implement many of the features in Homeless?. It is available on the Google Play Store. </p><p>This course is for anyone who wishes to build a<strong> Life Simulator Game </strong>in <strong>Unity3D </strong>using a visual development tool called playMaker.  With <strong>playMaker</strong>, you can make entire games without writing a single line of code. In fact, in this course we build and entire working Life Simulator game without a single line of C# code. The entire project is 100% playMaker visual diagrams. </p><p><strong>Learn the power of visual programming:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Perfect for making your very first video game ever! <strong>Requires Unity3D (Free to download) &amp; playMaker</strong></p></li><li><p>Start from the very beginning and follow step-by-step. The course is designed for complete beginners</p></li><li><p>This course is fast paced and focused on building your game. Although this is for beginners these are not boring lectures with fillers. Each lecture you will be learning to design games and building on your game</p></li><li><p>Learn to build a complete game in Unity 3D with no C# programming required for any of the game.</p></li><li><p>Focus on incremental development skills will help you create you own games</p></li><li><p>Clear, easy to understand lectures that are paced to make it fun and easy to learn Unity3d &amp; PlayMaker</p></li><li><p>Created by OdooClass Videos... creator of Idle Business Simulation for C# enjoyed by over 1,000 students</p></li><li><p>Great starting off point for those who wish to get into game development or expand their range of skills</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why would an experienced C#, Python, or Javascript programmer be interested in PlayMaker?</strong><br></p><p>There are several reasons why even experienced programmers may wish to experiment with PlayMaker. </p><ul><li><p>Building games in PlayMaker vs C# allows you to look at game development from a different perspective.</p></li><li><p>As a developer myself who has written code in dozens of languages, it is often refreshing to build games in a visual tool like PlayMaker.  A break from coding and still making games can be fun. </p></li><li><p>How you approach the design and how you build up your game has unique solutions and challenges you will not face  when writing typical C# games.  </p></li><li><p>It is relatively easy for an experienced C# developer to write actions that work with PlayMaker. This allows you to use PlayMaker as a state machine and for managing high level functions of your game design while using C# for more complex calculations and algorithms that can be tedious to code using a visual tool.</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>****INCLUDES UPDATED SOURCE PROJECTS FOR SWIFT 3 and Xcode 8</p><p> </p><p>This six hour Swift and Sprite Kit tutorial series has an one big theme tying each example project together: gameplay that can go on as long as the player can manage to stay alive. The challenge of an endless-style game isn't to beat up as many street thugs as possible, it taps into something more addictive. An endless game tests your reflexes and makes you struggle to best yourself again, and again, and again. Modern classics like Crossy Road or Banana King are two great examples of endless-style games we'll try to emulate in this series. Along the way, you'll learn some key concepts every Swift and Sprite Kit developer should have in their arsenal of knowledg</p>\n\n<p><strong></strong><strong>Session 1 – The Endlessly Moving World Node</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this first project we will populate a perpetually moving “world” node with randomly generated physics objects. We also look at converting CGPoint locations in Swift from the worldNode coordinates to scene coordinates, enumerating through every child in the scene, adding and clearing out nodes as needed, and much more!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Session 2 – Endless Level Units</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this series of videos we will modify the project from the first section and create “level units”, for example, sections or modules of a level that each can contain their own objects and be generated as needed or removed when they become out-of-view. The finished example project creates a kind of elevator style game where the character hops from platform to platform as long as possible. We will also look at the code to randomly move each platform (or any object) up and down and switch direction if it exceeds the visible screen area, as well as some ever-useful code to always center a world node on the player.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Session 3 – An Endless Frogger Project</strong></p>\n\n<p>In these video tutorials we will create an endless game similar to Frogger or Crossy Road. Level units will again be created on the fly, with the distinction now of being either a “road” unit or “water” unit, each one having their own type obstacles. Physics-wise we will have four Body types: road, water, roadObject (cars) and waterObject (lilypads), and leave the door open to many more!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Session 4 – Endless RPG Style Level</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this session we will convert the previous project to an endless top-down viewed RPG style world. The player can wander endlessly through randomly generated worlds, possibly to avoid objects or collect them. We will setup an array to track “level unit” locations that have already been added, then as the character wanders around, create new level units as needed. We will also include the option to remove level units the character has left (which could replace those units when the character walked back to them)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Session 5 -An Endless Runner</strong></p>\n\n<p>Modeled after the very-popular Banana Kong game, this 5th project builds upon our previous ones in the series with a few notable changes, and ironically some simplifications. This session begins by limiting character movements to only one direction. Then we'll give our character some typical side scroller controls (jumping, running, sliding and gliding). We'll add a looping parallax background, and adjust our LevelUnit and Object classes to create ground/water planes and obstacles for a 2D platform world. And finally we'll finesse our collision detection code so the character can drop down through Platforms when swiping down, break certain objects when sliding, and of course get killed when running into other objects.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Did you just learn how to program in Python and needs to practice a bit more? Are you looking for some mildly complex project to challenge your skills? In this Python 102 course, we'll implement a text-based pac-game together, from scratch. Throughout the videos, we'll go together through all the challenges of implementing a game (how to design the map, how to move the characters, how to understand that the game is over) while exercising all the basics of the Python language.</p><p>This entire course is basically a live coding session. You will see:</p><ul><li><p>How to create simple data structures to store things like the map and game points</p></li><li><p>How to write complex ifs to take the different game decisions</p></li><li><p>How to properly use loops, e.g., to control the main game loop</p></li><li><p>How to get data from the keyboard and react to it</p></li><li><p>How to test your program using basic automated unit testing</p></li><li><p>How to make mistakes, understand why your program is failing, and how to learn from the mistakes</p></li></ul><p>I&nbsp;speak out loud every step I&nbsp;take, including my mistakes. In the end of every video, you are asked to implement the pac-man yourself. Did you get lost?&nbsp;No worries, you can find the source code of the game at every point in time in the resources of the course.</p><p>If you are looking for a nice way to reinforce your recently acquired Python skills, this is the course for you!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>This course will walk you through building an entire video game hands-on, and will take you step-by-step through the game development process.</strong></p><p>Did you grow up playing Super Smash Bros? Are you a fan of classic Nintendo characters? Growing up, I loved playing Super Smash Bros. Melee and always wanted to know how fighting games were made. Now, I make games professionally for a living and have a deep understanding of what goes into making all types of games, including fighting games.</p><p>This course is meant to teach you how to build a full fighting game in Unity, even if you are a beginner or have never used Unity before. By the end of this course, you will have a full Super Smash Bros. style game in Unity that you built from the ground up. I will teach you how to develop and animate the following characters using the sprite sheets that I created and provide with this course: <strong>Donkey Kong, Mario</strong>, <strong>Pikachu</strong>, <strong>Samus</strong>, <strong>Ice Climbers</strong>, <strong>Captain Falcon</strong>, <strong>Bowser</strong>, <strong>Link</strong>, and <strong>Sonic</strong>.</p><p>Each character will have three attacks and be able to jump. Donkey Kong will feature his classic down smash that shakes the camera and sends enemies flying into the air. Mario will throw flaming mushroom projectiles. Pikachu will feature his classing lighting attack, zapping the opposition. Samus will have his charge beam that lets the user build up power and then release a sci-fi blast. The Ice Climbers will be able to freeze enemies and tag team their way to victory. Captain Falcon will use his Falcon Punch to blast enemies. Bowser will be able to spew fire which we will create using Unity’s particle system. Link will have the ability to fire arrows and throw bombs at enemies. Sonic will be able to turn into Super Sonic and blast enemies with energy.</p><p>This course will teach you how to create 4 way battles between these characters with a user and 3 CPU characters. Each of the 9 characters can be used by the player or the CPU. We are going to code the enemy AI from the ground up so that we can play against the computer, who will fight back and try to knock us off the stage!</p><p>As we build this course, you are going to gain a wealth of knowledge in the different areas of the Unity game engine. Some of the core game development techniques this course will teach you are:</p><ul><li><p>Working with 2D graphics and sprite sheets and building character animations from them</p></li><li><p>Use the Animation and Animator components to build finite state machines that transition between player attacks</p></li><li><p>Customize the mouse cursor with custom hand graphics that let the user drag and drop indicators to select characters and point and click to choose levels.</p></li><li><p>Object-oriented C# scripting techniques for writing clean, re-usable code.</p></li><li><p>Adding a camera shake for Donkey Kong’s ground-and-pound move as well as other special effects for other characters’ move sets</p></li><li><p>Learn about the different UI components and how they can be used together to build in-game menus and selection screens that efficiently and intuitively respond to user input.</p></li><li><p>Use powerful programming techniques like Actions and Coroutines to control timing and execution of code and handle attack logic</p></li><li><p>Work with Unity’s physics system to allow for interactions between characters and the environment.</p></li><li><p>Turn your ideas into code using C# with Unity and build up a set of skills that you can use to build other fighting games and showcase them in your portfolio.</p></li></ul><p>By the end of this course, you will have a full game project you developed from the ground up! You will also have some more C# tips and tricks that you can add to your arsenal. If you want to learn game development or are aspiring to build a career in the game industry, then this course is for you!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to my Udemy course on how to make a complete game from scratch in Unity.</p><p>For this course we will be making a Match3 puzzle game.</p><p>Some of the wildly successful Match 3 puzzle games you may have heard of or played are; Bejewelled, Candy Crush, Anipang, Puzzle &amp; Dragon, and Zookeeper.</p><p><br></p><p>These games all contain a grid of matchable objects. The player must swap 2 adjacent objects in the grid to form a matching set of 3 objects in a row or column and is rewarded with an increasing score. If larger matches are formed, the player is awarded a power-up which can help them achieve an even higher score.</p><p><br></p><p>These games are extremely simple to play, having very limited input, making them accessible to a wide audience. However, the complexity of the grid system and randomization of the options available make the games difficult to master.</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, you’ll learn how to apply coding patterns and object-oriented programming principles in Unity to produce a set of tools that will help you efficiently manage resources throughout the game development cycle. You’ll use these tools to build a Match 3 game from scratch, learning to use many of Unity’s features along the way. Unlike some other game development courses, the scripts you will write in this course will be structured, clean, efficient, and reusable for other projects.</p><p><br></p><p>Updated 05/22/23 : Coding segments are zoomed in to improve readability.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>This course is made with the latest content and newest technics used in modern Game Development</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The best way to learn anything is by doing it in a really fun way and this is where this course comes from. If you want to learn how all these incredible games you see are made there is no better place to start than this course. We made sure that this course has everything you need to take you from a beginner (even with zero codding experience) and slowly take you to intermediate level</p><p><br></p><p>I chose the main project in this course to be a 2D Roguelike because it not only has a vast library of game development concepts that we can implement and learn, but also because it's very simple (especially if you are a beginner) to delve in and get started on your game development journey.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything in this course has been meticulously crafted, review and recrafted to provide you with the best experience possible and maximize your learning as much as possible. So not only will you have a great time learning you'll also get the most value by going away from this course with a lot of tools in your arsenal to continue you journey in the wild west of game development.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 1: Introduction</strong></p><p>We'll start off by downloading Unity and Visual studio. Installing them and making sure they work. We will then create our first code in C# and get used to Unity interface. Finally we'll talk about the game design of our game and what it takes to start creating a game from scratch</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 2: Setting Up Our World</strong></p><p>In this section we are going to start learning what sprite sheets are and how to set them up. We'll learn what sorting layers are in Unity. We'll look into colliders and RigidBodies and add them to our game objects and see how it starts getting affected by physics. we'll learn how to animate our sprites. We'll even understand what blending trees that will greatly help us reduce difficulty of animating</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 3: Setting Up Shooting Mechanics</strong></p><p>In this section we will be creating our players bullets, firing then in the direction out mouse is pointing, having a counter to create automatic firing and add impact effects to those bullets. While doing all of that we'll be learning about prefabs and instantiation and how to manipulate the world of our game to make it look much nicer</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 4: Setting Up Enemies</strong></p><p>This section completed the previous one. We create our shooting mechanics but now we need something to actually shoot at. We'll be setting up our enemies and moving them towards the player. We'll delve deeper to animations by adding the to our enemy and the use methods, arrays and something called a Coroutine that will take us deep into C#</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 5: Creating Rooms (Tile map)</strong></p><p>Up to this point we used a pre-created image to represent the map. Those days are over and it's time for us to create our own map. We'll be introduced to tilemaps in Unity, add various colliders to it and learn about a mechanic in Unity that few know which is the Cinemachine. We'll also have our fair share of C# when we learn foreach loops, and Lists&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 6: Level Flow</strong></p><p>In this section we will learn about the scene manager in Unity that will allow us to create multiple levels in our game and transition between them. Plus we'll learn a very tricky way to making sure we always arrive in the right position when moving through our worlds</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 7: Destructible Environment</strong></p><p>This is One of the most fun section in the course. Every roguelike has a dashing mechanic and we are going to have ours as well. We'll add a tornado mechanic but not only will it make us invincible and a bit fast it will also destroy any \"destructible\" game object in our path</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 8: Advanced Shooting (weapons system)</strong></p><p>What's better than having a weapons to shoot with? Having a lot of them and being able to choose between them on the go, we'll be adding multiple weapons to our game. Each with their own using shooting style, speed and damage. With various bullets and firing rate for each. Not only that, we'll also make our camera shake whenever we shoot to add more weight to our game </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 9: Health System</strong></p><p>In this section we'll be adding a player health system. We also visualize it by create a health bar that we can clearly see on a Canvas. We'll learn how we can update that health bar through script and add a cool death screen every time our player suffers a death. Finally we'll be adding spikes to the ground, once the player gets on them they will get hurt and lose a bit of that health</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 10: Pickups</strong></p><p>In this section we'll delve into pickups. We'll be picking up weapons from the ground. Coins with which we'll be able to buy money in shops, health packs that once hurt we can go and pickup and we'll also add a chest that we can open and get a weapons from. A random weapons this is where our C# skills will be begin to come to fruition </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 11: Music &amp; SFX</strong></p><p>Time to breath some life into this game adding sound effects and Music. Now our game goes from static to dynamic. We will add background Music and SFX. To each level and each interaction respectively</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 12: Multiple Enemy Types (Some should have melee attacks)</strong></p><p>What's more fun that having 1 enemy that can kill you? Having 4 different type of enemies that can kill you. We'll have the wanderer, the patroller, the scared enemy and the angry skeletal enemy. This section will be the foundation of our enemy AI and will open the doors for the way we'll implement our boss in the upcoming section</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 13: Shop &amp; Money System</strong></p><p>Now that we pick up items, we want to sell them... for MONEY! who doesn't like money? we will introduce a monetary system so basically create an economy. We create a shop with a shop keeper inside and we'll be able to transact with him using the money we have to buy and the items we have to sell</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 14: Creating Menus</strong></p><p>Every game HAS to have a main menu. But it also needs a dynamic main menu. We create a simple menu with a background. But the exiting part of this is the way we give the ability to our player to either continue from his last save or start a new game. We'll also be adding a Victory screen, a way to restart the level after death and a Pause/Resume mechanic </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 15: Boss Battles (Advanced Unity State Machine)</strong></p><p>It's time for the really fun part here. We'll be create a boss fight fight. But not just any boss fight, this boss fight will be using a state machine. Which is also at the same time out animator. We'll be suing it to transition the boss from state to state, and in each one he will have a different set of attacks </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Bonus Section 16: Room Generation (Advanced C# Object Oriented Programming)</strong></p><p>We come to our final section where we will be creating multiple rooms each with it's fun little tweak on the game mechanics, we'll have a random enemy spawner. We'll have doors that are closed and that upon only once we destroy all the enemies in our desired level. And we will have an option to choose between 2 levels to go to after we kill everyone that's in here</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What You Will Learn In This Course:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Use Visual Studio with Unity in a simple way</p></li><li><p>How to set a good Game Development environment</p></li><li><p>Unity Engine are in a simple and comprehensive way</p></li><li><p>The Basics of C# in the most fun ways possible by creating a game</p></li><li><p>Use player input to control the behavior of our game</p></li><li><p>Add different component to game objects</p></li><li><p>Add gravity and other forces to game objects</p></li><li><p>Make game objects interact with each other in our game</p></li><li><p>Add sprite sheets and slice them up</p></li><li><p>Create Tile assets</p></li><li><p>How to create levels from our tile assets</p></li><li><p>Become a ninja problem solver and learn how to go step by step to solve any problem in Game Development and coding</p></li><li><p>Create animations</p></li></ol>",

  "description": "<p>  \t    This course's main objective is to become the go-to source for anyone willing to enter the iPhone app industry.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t   The course starts with us in front of a regular Apple computer (or MacInCloud for PC users) and I will guide you through all the step necessary to set up your computer for development. I will also go through each steps to become a licensed iOS developer.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t   We will then install the game from the source code(included with this course), run the game on the simulator, then modify the graphics and sounds to customize the 'match 3' game into one of your own.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t   Then we will setup three advertising channels to ensure money coming in. Then we will publish the game to the Apple app store.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t   This course is not about theories. Once you complete this course, you have a real product of your own in the app store, bringing in profit. You can't pass this opportunity.  </p>\n\n<p>  \tThere has been plenty of reskins of these apps by myself and by many students.</p>\n\n<p>  \tAlso feel free to ask me anything that goes through your mind, I love to help!</p>\n\n<p>  \tCheers!  </p>\n\n<p>  \tYohann  </p>\n\n<p>  \t *The sourcecode is not Candy Crush's source code, it does have the same match-3 game mechanics.  </p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to <strong><em>Low-Poly Character Modeling &amp; Animation in Blender for Unity</em></strong>, a&nbsp;course by Billy McDaniel.</p><p>In this course, we'll design a low-poly, flat shaded cartoon-style character model in Blender with separate parts for facial features including eyes, nose, teeth, ears, hair, hats&nbsp;&amp; helmets, clothing, armor and melee weapons. We'll setup bones and rigging so that we can fully animate our new model. And then I'll show you how to use a grayscale color atlas material that allows you to create any colored material you desire from within Unity. Next, we'll setup the Animator state machine and write a script that allows us to change animation clips on demand. We'll download a few clips from&nbsp;Mixamo's free website to get started.</p><p>By the end of this course you should have a good foundation to build a variety of character models in Blender with the freedom to swap out animations however you see fit. My goal is to help you finish this course with all of the experience you need to start making&nbsp; low-poly, flat-shaded characters and enemies for your Unity video games.</p><p>So if this sounds like something you'd like to start doing on your own... then welcome aboard. I hope to see you in the next lecture.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Have you ever wanted to design a game inventory system that’s more than just a simple item list? Are you a programmer or artist wanting to blend code and 3D art to create an interactive and immersive Viking-themed inventory? Then this course is for you! In it, you’ll explore both coding and art creation, giving you the skills to build a professional-grade inventory system that can be adapted to any game project.</p><p>In this course, Penny and Mike combine their expertise in <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>Blender</strong> to teach you the essential skills for designing, programming, and modeling an immersive inventory system. You’ll benefit from their years of industry experience with detailed explanations and hands-on projects that cover every aspect of development.</p><p>This course offers over 15 hours of hands-on content, guiding you through the creation of a functional inventory system with <strong>Unity 6</strong> and <strong>Blender</strong>.</p><p>We’ll start by laying a solid foundation with Unity setup and essential 3D modeling skills, then dive deep into creating a full-featured inventory system—from item data storage and UI design to interactive item management and 3D previews.</p><p><strong>In this course, you will:</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1) Build a fully interactive inventory system in Unity&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2) Model and texture 3D assets in Blender for use in games&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3) Implement custom editor scripts and UI elements in Unity&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4) Combine all the elements in a third-person 3D game environment</p><p>The course is broken into two main parts, which can be taken individually or as a complete learning journey:</p><p><strong>Part A</strong></p><p>In Part A, learn how to program and structure the Inventory System in <strong>Unity 6</strong>, covering:</p><p><em>Setting up Unity and Using ScriptableObjects</em>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; Efficiently organize item data using ScriptableObjects for maximum flexibility.</p><p><em>Item Categorization and Custom Editors</em>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; Use enums to create item categories and develop a custom editor for managing inventory items with ease.</p><p><em>Adding, Removing, and Stacking Items </em></p><p>&nbsp; Program functions to add, remove, and stack items, ensuring a smooth player experience.</p><p><em>Inventory Interactions and Testing</em>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; Design tests to validate inventory behavior, with runtime testing functions for quick prototyping.</p><p><em>Setting up the Unity Input System</em>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; Add custom input actions for interacting with the inventory, such as item dropping and equipping.</p><p><strong>Part B</strong></p><p>In Part B, learn how to design and integrate 3D items with Blender, covering:</p><p><em>Scope and Specification</em></p><p>Understanding the goals and scope of any project is critical to succeeding. and when it comes to realistic models managing the potential for scope creep is important.</p><p><em>Making The Low Poly Assets</em></p><p>Models have to start somewhere, and making low poly assets allows us to focus on the basics of good topology and form.</p><p><em>Sculpting Details</em></p><p>Sculpting is a fantastic way of adding detail to any model, taking them from basic to unique assets.</p><p><em>Preparing For Texturing</em></p><p>Understand the texturing process and unwrapping your models is much easier than you think!</p><p><em>Texturing Models</em></p><p>Flat models are boring, creating PBR textures bring your models to life.</p><p><em>Baking Textures</em></p><p>Games require optimised assets, we'll generate high-quality texture maps to apply to your assets takin models with over 100,000 polygons down to a model in the 1000s without compromising on quality.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What students are saying about Penny and Mike's other courses:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>This course was incredibly thorough! Penny’s clear explanations combined with Mike’s art direction really made complex concepts accessible.</em></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><em>I’ve been using Unity for a few years, but this course gave me new insights into both coding and art integration. The inventory system I built has become the foundation of my latest game!</em></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><em>I can’t recommend this course enough. It’s perfect if you want to get hands-on with Unity and Blender—everything was so well structured, I felt like I was building a real project from start to finish!</em></p></li></ul><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>I will be completely honest with you.</p><p>In the past, I have been struggling for months to find good information on internet on how to create and host real dedicated game server. There is hardly any well structured information on this topic. Now that I have a decent understanding on the topic I've decided to share it with you. I really hope this course will help you lay the foundation on your journey in the world of online multiplayer games.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here is what you should expect in the course:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>1. In the first section we are creating very minimal setup of our client-server communication using Unity3D, .NET 6 and the networking library LiteNetLib.</p><p><br></p><p>2. After we are done with the proof of concept, or as a like to call it \"walking-skeleton\" project, we will continue by laying the foundation of a strongly typed client to server communication. We will implement packet serialization and deserialization and will make it so the logic that handles different packets is separate in different packet handlers and it will use strongly typed C# structs.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Once the networking layer is done, we will work on two core scenes that are essential for any multiplayer game. Login and Lobby scenes.</p><p><br></p><p>4. In the login scene, we will allow the players to identify themselves and register in our server. We will handle user input validation and we will give the user visual feedback in the form of loading animation.</p><p><br></p><p>5. In the lobby scene we will create a sorted list of the top 10 players and will show their statuses (online or offline). We will also show the current total players count on the server. In addition to that we will update the list on all clients when a new player joins or an existing one turns offline.</p><p><br></p><p>6. After we are done with that, we will enable the players to register in our matchmaking pool and search for opponents by pressing the \"Find Opponent\" button.</p><p><br></p><p>7. Once a match is found, we will redirect the players to the actual game scene, where they will be able to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe.</p><p><br></p><p>8. We will implement beautiful animations and handle corner cases on both server and client-side.</p><p><br></p><p>9. After one game session is complete we will allow the players to request to play again and then of course give them the ability to accept or reject the offer.</p><p><br></p><p>10. And last but not least, once we are ready with the game client and server, we will deploy our server to a cloud provider and will connect to it from the client.</p><p><br></p><p>11. If there is interest in the course I will expand it with additional bonus sections, depending on the needs of the students.</p><p><br></p><p>Since this is my first course in Udemy, my presentation skills are far from perfect and I apologize for that, but I still believe that there is valuable information that you can benefit from. I really hope you enjoy it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Are there any course requirements or prerequisites?</strong></p><p>Basic understanding of Unity3D and .NET</p><p>A passion and desire to learn more about how to create online multiplayer game.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who this course is for:</strong></p><p>This course is intended for anyone that is interested on creating a custom dedicated server using low-level networking. The course itself is not for complete beginners as do not cover very basic concepts like for example: How to install software or the very basics of C# programming. But I still believe that even if you are beginner you will be able to follow up, because the course is basically a step-by-step guide.</p>",

I will go over everything that you would need to build out an obby by yourself. We also go over making a checkpoint system where you respawn at the last checkpoint that you have touched. Aside from that we also deal with building out the obby from start to finish, including the spawn point, the finish, and all the stages in between! We will create kill parts, which kill the player when the player touches the part. I will explain how to write this script, but also how you can leverage the toolbox so that you don't always have to write the scripts yourself! Furthermore I will go over the basics of roblox game development that will help you make an obby game in Roblox</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of this course, you will hopefully have built your own Roblox obby!</p>",

  "description": "<p>  \t     This course has been especially designed to take your complete beginner or intermediate level skills in Stencyl and build them up to the level required of a professional indie mobile game developer. Where as the foundation course (Create your First Computer Game with Stencyl), teaches you many important skills, concepts, and techniques necessary to implement core gameplay, utilize sound, and implement some basic AI, this course will teach you how to Create a complete, professional grade computer game which can be published on all the most popular platforms -- Google Play, IOS, Windows, Linux, Mac, Flash etc.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t     From start to finish, you will develop a complete, playable game including all the advanced features and polish you would expect, such as:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \t<li>start menu</li>  \t<li>social link buttons</li>  \t<li>multiple, playable levels</li>  \t<li>level selection screens</li>  \t<li> saving and loading</li><li>in-app purchases and ads (for revenue generation)</li>  \t<li>beautiful, unique art and animations</li>  \t<li>parallax scrolling</li>  \t<li>sophisticated gameplay </li>  </ul>\n\n<p>  \t    We also cover less technical -- but none the less essential -- subjects such as marketing, design theory, game monetization paradigms and various other business and design tips and tricks for game development . After the core game has been developed, the course leads into sections on what it takes to publish it to the various Stencyl supported platforms (Desura, Steam, Google Play, Samsung Apps, IndieCity etc), including platform specific details such as certificates, marketplace restrictions, monetization methodologies etc.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t    In short, when you've finished this course, you will have learned everything you need to know to start developing, publishing and monetizing professional quality desktop and mobile games with Stencyl. So let's get started!  </p>",

With <strong>Unreal Engine, C++, and AI</strong>, you’ll have full creative freedom and complete control.</p><p>By the end of the course, you won’t need to ask “how do I build a game?” again.&nbsp; You’ll know.

  "description": "<p>The best way to learn anything is by doing it in a <strong>really fun way</strong> and this is where this course comes from. If you want to learn how all these <strong>incredible games</strong> you see are made there is no better place to start than this course. We made sure that this course has everything you need to take you from a beginner <strong>(even with zero codding experience)</strong> and slowly take you to intermediate level</p><p>I chose the main project in this course to be a <strong>2D RPG </strong>because it not only has a vast library of game development concepts that we can implement and learn, but also because it's very <strong>simple (especially if you are a beginner) </strong>to delve in and get started on your <strong>game development journey.</strong></p><p>Everything in this course has been <strong>meticulously crafted</strong>, review and recrafted to provide you with the <strong>best experience</strong> possible and maximize your learning as much as possible. So not only will you have a great time learning you'll also get the <strong>MOST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK</strong> by going away from this course with a lot of tools in your arsenal to continue you journey in the <strong>wild west</strong> of game development.</p><p><strong>Section 1: Introduction</strong></p><p>We'll start off by downloading Unity and Visual studio. Installing them and making sure they work. We will then create our first code in C# and get used to Unity interface. Finally we'll talk about the game design of our game and what it takes to start creating a game from scratch</p><p><strong>Section 2: Setting Up Player</strong></p><p>In this section we are going to start learning what sprite sheets are and how to set them up. We'll learn what sorting layers are in Unity. We'll look into colliders and RigidBodies and add them to our game objects and see how it starts getting affected by physics. we'll learn how to animate our sprites. We'll even understand what blending trees that will greatly help us reduce difficulty of animating</p><p><strong>Section 3: Scene Management</strong></p><p>In this section we will learn about the scene manager in Unity that will allow us to create multiple levels in our game and transition between them. Plus we'll learn a very tricky way to making sure we always arrive in the right position when moving through our worlds</p><p><strong>Section 4: Tilemaps &amp; Cinemachine</strong></p><p>This section is the evolution of the previous one. Where we move from just adding maps as images to painting them using tile sets that you can download and customize yourself. We also learn about Cinemachine which is a very powerful and modern tool in Unity</p><p><strong>Section 5: Dialog In Game</strong></p><p>What game doesn't have a dialog system. This is where we add new NPC's to our game. Create UI learn about arrays and add more life to our game by introducing a way to interact with the world around us that we created in the previous section</p><p><strong>Section 6: Player Stats</strong></p><p>Again what game, especially a RPG doesn't have stats for every character? WE have strength, Mana, health etc.. and we introduce a leveling system and XP. We learn about loops in C# which is a very powerful tool in and programming language and will really build your foundations</p><p><strong>Section 7: Menu System</strong></p><p>This section is full of artistic creating which means you have the full liberty of creating your own. This is were we don't create anything NEW but we put all the information that we've taking into account so far in front of our player and making sure he can access that info easily</p><p><strong>Section 8: Inventory System</strong></p><p>This is also a section that could have been called ADVANCED C# because we take our coding to the next level. We learn about Lists another powerful tool in C#. We learn how to pick up items. Add them to our inventory using the advanced C# tools and make sure that all of this works smoothly especially when we also discard those items. Finally we use those items on our characters</p><p><strong>Section 9: Shop &amp; Money Systems</strong></p><p>Now that we pick up items, we want to sell them... for MONEY! who doesn't like money? we will introduce a monetary system so basically create an economy. We create a shop with a shop keeper inside and we'll be able to transact with him using the money we have to buy and the items we have to sell</p><p><strong>Section 10: Questing System</strong></p><p>This is my favorite part of the game. Because we start adding quests. And this turns our game from a normal game to and RPG. We can get quests, complete them, get rewarded with items. Some objects will only appear on after we complete some kind of quest. This one is really fun</p><p><strong>Section 11: Save &amp; Load</strong></p><p>It's imperative that we do not lose our progress in an RPG that's why we introduce a Save and Load system. We will keep track of our player position and the world he was in. We will keep track of the items we have in a very sophisticated way. And every else also that needs to be saved and loaded</p><p><strong>Section 12: Music &amp; SFX</strong></p><p>Time to breath some life into this game adding sound effects and Music. Now our game goes from static to dynamic. We will add background Music and SFX. To each level and each interaction respectively</p><p><strong>Section 13: Main Menu</strong></p><p>Every game HAS to have a main menu. But it also needs a dynamic main menu. We create a simple menu with a background. But the exiting part of this is the way we give the ability to our player to either continue from his last save or start a new game</p><p><strong>Section 14: Setting Up Battle System</strong></p><p>Until this point we've had a pretty decent game I would say. But now it's time for the real deal. We are no longer walking around and talking to NPC's it's time for WAR. We are creating a battle system. This is the first step of one the biggest scripts that you and I will ever create. So strap your thinking caps on and hold down to your seats this is going to be an exhilarating ride</p><p><strong>Section 15: Enemy Attack System</strong></p><p>Now that we've started a battle with enemies. Time to give them the ability to attack us. We will choose which enemy is attacking. How much damage he's giving and we'll even display it on screen and see what happens when our players don't have any health left</p><p><strong>Section 16: Player Attack System</strong></p><p>Now it's our players turn to defend themselves. We will give the ability to fight back. And also the ability to run away from the battle. We'll use various attacks such as normal slashing, using different types of magic and on top of that using items during battle</p><p><strong>Section 17: Battle System Ending</strong></p><p>This is where our journey ends unfortunately my fellow game developers. We handle the dead players. We handle the dead battlers. We create a victory screen. A game over screen. We give our rewards. And we end this section and this course with a BANG!! by creating a BOSS fight</p><p><strong>What You Will Learn In This Course:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Use Visual Studio with Unity in a simple way</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How to set a good Game Development environment</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Unity Engine are in a simple and comprehensive way</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The Basics of C# in the most fun ways possible by creating a game</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Use player input to control the behavior of our game</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Add different component to game objects</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Add gravity and other forces to game objects</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Make game objects interact with each other in our game</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Add sprite sheets and slice them up</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Create Tile assets</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How to create levels from our tile assets</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Become a ninja problem solver and learn how to go step by step to solve any problem in Game Development and coding</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Create animations</strong></p></li></ol>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Do you want to learn how to create amazing&nbsp;video games for FREE with LibGDX?</strong></p><p>I'm Brandon and I'm going to help you <strong>master</strong> LibGDX by creating a <strong>complete and fully functional cross-platform</strong> 2D video game.</p><p>LibGDX is a <strong>free and open-source</strong> game development framework. Game development frameworks are collections of libraries and tools that provide building blocks that developers can use to create their own games, and are more lightweight and flexible than game engines, like Unity 3D, Unreal Engine, and Godot.</p><p>LibGDX also provides <strong>cross-platform deployment</strong>, meaning that a game created with LibGDX can be run on multiple platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, and web browsers.</p><p><em>(NOTE: Please be aware that you will need to know some Java in order to get the most out of this course. Taking a short 2-3 hour Java course on YouTube should be more than enough.)</em></p><p>The Game Dev Kickstart course is very <strong>comprehensive </strong>and is full of <strong>extremely valuable information</strong> for creating incredible 2D&nbsp;games using LibGDX. We'll begin by installing the JDK&nbsp;(Java Development Kit)&nbsp;and the IntelliJ IDEA&nbsp;IDE, which we'll be using to write the code for our game. After that, we'll jump right into learning all about LibGDX by creating a complete 2D&nbsp;fighting game called Stick Figure Showdown. Among the <strong>dozens of topics</strong> we will be covering throughout the course, we'll learn how to:</p><ul><li><p>draw images to the screen and animate them</p></li><li><p>manage assets (images, audio, etc.)&nbsp;using an asset manager</p></li><li><p>work with cameras and viewports for full control over how our game appears on different screen resolutions</p></li><li><p>handle keyboard and touch input from the player</p></li><li><p>generate fonts using the Freetype extension</p></li><li><p>display a HUD&nbsp;(Heads-Up Display)</p></li><li><p>create and use texture atlases for enhanced performance</p></li><li><p>add text and clickable buttons to the screen</p></li><li><p>add sound and music to our game</p></li><li><p>add AI (Artificial Intelligence) for the opponent fighter</p></li><li><p>create and switch between various types of screens (main menu, settings, etc.)</p></li><li><p>use Scene2D&nbsp;for more efficient UI (User Interface)&nbsp;layout</p></li><li><p>allow the player to change and save various settings of the game (difficulty, fullscreen mode, etc.)</p></li><li><p><strong>EXTRA: add Android functionality to our game!</strong></p></li></ul><p>You'll also get access to all of the resources and code for the projects in this course!</p><p><strong>So what are you waiting for?&nbsp;Join now and let's start developing games today!</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\"><span style=\"color:inherit;\">Classic game concepts. Modern programming.</span></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  When you think of maze games, you’ll probably think of Pac-Man, which isn’t hard to argue is the most popular game of all time. At that game’s core is a simple hook. Move at high speeds and don’t get caught, which is a fun concept for any player of any age. Even today some of the most popular games don’t rely on much more than a classic hook: something that is easy to play, but impossible to beat. A game like Flappy Bird is a recent testament to that.  </p>  <p>  \t  In this tutorial series, we’ll look at programming a conceptually simple game, but one that can be expanded in a hundred different directions using Apple’s amazingly easy physics engine. You’ll learn the latest in iOS programming technology: Swift and Sprite Kit.  Then for level design, you’ll get two options: create levels within Xcode 6 using the new Scene editor, or take a step outside Xcode and use Tiled, a free level design program which in our opinion, is a tad more refined and speeds up level creation.  </p>  <p>  \t  After this series, you will be a game developer!  Ready to submit your first app for the iPhone, iPad, and possibly even Apple Watch.  Plus using software like Apportable, you can even export your app to Android and a plethora of other devices.  </p>",

  "description": "<p>In this <strong>game development course with 98 byte sized videos, with a total of 10 hours of video content</strong>, you'll learn how to use the Godot Engine and Editor to create an <strong>Inventory System and Inventory UI (User Interface) that is fully dynamic, with scriptable object items and a central database of items</strong> (using Godot's Resources). The inventory system has support for <strong>multiple item categories, category groups, dynamic scrolling animations, equippable slots</strong> (example: main hand and off hand) and more. </p><p>The inventory system you are going to create is <strong>inspired by the Zelda Breath of the Wild inventory screen</strong>, and can be used in RPG, FPS, Adventure, Point-and-Click games and more, basically, any games where the player can <strong>acquire and keep track of items in different categories</strong>.</p><p>This is a <strong>MASTERCLASS about creating User Interfaces, Custom Systems, Custom Dynamic Data and Dynamic Interfaces with Godot</strong>. Not only data, it's a <strong>masterclass about Godot's Resource system</strong>.</p><p>This course gives you all the knowledge and the power to build <strong>responsive user interfaces with Godot,</strong> you will also learn how to make <strong>Dynamic Systems that use Dynamic Data using your own Data Model and Scriptable Objects</strong>.</p><p>You are also going to learn how to create your own <strong>extendable and expandable Godot's Game Objects and Components with custom Nodes, Scenes and Scripts</strong>. You are going to learn how to create custom Godot's Resources and how to mix and match Dynamic and Static data.</p><p><strong>ATTENTION!&nbsp;THIS&nbsp;IS&nbsp;A&nbsp;GODOT&nbsp;3.5+&nbsp;COURSE, IT'S&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;A&nbsp;GODOT&nbsp;4&nbsp;COURSE!</strong>&nbsp;Use Godot 4 at your own risk. In any case, the working, migrated Godot 4 source-code of the inventory system created in this course is also available and attached to the course, in case you want to compare and follow along [at your own risk] using Godot 4.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>In a single paragraph:</strong></p><p>You are going to <strong>learn EVERYTHING</strong> there is about creating <strong>complex User Interfaces with Godot</strong>, from scratch, as well as <strong>coding and adding behavior to those interfaces, creating truly dynamic UI screens and components.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>(Almost) everything that you are going to learn:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Godot Nodes and Scenes fundamentals. Understand what are <strong>Godot's Game Objects and Components in depth</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Godot Control Nodes and UI fundamentals including margins, anchors, layouts,<strong> responsive layouts, aspect ratios </strong>and more</p></li><li><p>How to understand Godot's <strong>Container Nodes, Automatic UI Placement and Size Flags</strong></p></li><li><p>How to create Big User Interface Screens with Godot that are also responsive for different screen sizes and aspect ratios.</p></li><li><p>How to create your own <strong>custom UI widgets, expand and inherit them</strong> (custom Control Nodes and Scenes)</p></li><li><p>How to create an <strong>infinite scrolling container and grids of items, how to split it by pages and how to animate it dynamically</strong></p></li><li><p>How to structure the <strong>Data Model of an inventory and equipment system, separating items by categories and creating groups of categories</strong>, for example, listing <strong>One Handed Weapons and Two Handed Weapons under a Weapons group</strong>, while keeping the One and Two Handed classifications</p></li><li><p>How to have and list <strong>multiple pages of items</strong> under the same category</p></li><li><p>How to create User Interface that uses both Dynamic and Static data</p></li><li><p>How to create <strong>Equippable Item slots that accept configurable categories </strong>of items and show the items equipped in these slots</p></li><li><p>How to display item and <strong>equipment attributes</strong></p></li><li><p>How to create and expand <strong>custom Scriptable Objects (Custom Godot's Resources)</strong> with different attributes for items and equipment</p></li><li><p>Godot's scripting language, <strong>GDScript, including the Observer pattern with GDScript's Signals </strong>in details, with a sample Traffic Light project</p></li><li><p>How to write custom GDScript Signals, connect to them and emit them</p></li><li><p><strong>Advanced user interface coding with GDScript</strong></p></li><li><p>How to handle and <strong>sync One Handed and Two Handed items,</strong> while automatically unequipping items if both hands are equipped</p></li><li><p>How to create <strong>pickable items, dynamically add them to the inventory</strong> and list them in the inventory screen, in the correct category</p></li><li><p>And more!</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Course Structure</strong></p><p>This course is divided as:</p><ul><li><p>98 byte sized videos, 10 hours in total</p></li><li><p>Godot fundamentals</p></li><li><p>Creating the user interface with the Godot Editor</p></li><li><p>Planning the inventory system data model</p></li><li><p>GDScript Crash Course</p></li><li><p>Programming everything with GDScript</p></li></ul><p>In the programming section, I explain the reasoning behind each line of code, so expect lots of drawings.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Godot Version</strong></p><p><strong>This course uses Godot 3.4.3</strong>. Since Godot 4 builds upon the fundamentals of Godot 3, this course is long lasting, you are not going to get something that will get deprecated. All of the knowledge is transferable, especially on how to build UIs and structure the data models.</p><p>Godot 4 is still too unstable and susceptible for breaking changes. When Godot 4 stable release comes out, I'll record upgrade and migration videos, this way you are going to learn twice as much.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p><p>This course is intended for all audiences, the only requirement is to know a bit of programming logic. You don't need to know Godot before starting this course.</p><p><br></p><p>Trailer music from ZapSplat</p>",

  "description": "<ul><li><strong></strong><strong>Presenting the latest course by Nathan Cope, one of Udemy's top instructors:  How to Build Games in Unity. Nathan's other course on building PC's sports a 5-star rating with thousands of satisfied students.</strong></li><li><strong>Over 1500 students signed up in the first 24 hours of course release!</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>________________________________________<br></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have you ever wanted to make your own game?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is for you. Unity has become one of the top platforms for game development, especially for newcomers to the industry. It is simple and powerful at the same time and very successful high-profile games have been created with it! Ever hear of Hearthstone? ;)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course will begin with an introduction into the Unity UI. In order to keep the course exciting, there is no \"C# Primer\" for new programmers. Instead, Nathan will teach you about basic programming concepts along the way as he uses them to create the game code! </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Nathan will take extra care in explaining different programming concepts in different ways in order to get those concepts to 'stick'. Being one of the top instructors on Udemy, he understands that students need to see a problem being solved in a number of ways, as not everyone learns the same way.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will learn things like creating game objects, configuring prefabs, coroutines, timers, animation, UI, sounds and so much more. Nathan responds to questions very quickly, so if you have any trouble along the way, please send him a message!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Student Appreciation!</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As a student, you will receive special discounts unavailable elsewhere for Nathan's other courses that are available now or are currently in the works!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And as always, 30-day refunds are 100% guaranteed if your satisfaction is not met!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thank you! </strong>Thank you for taking a look at this course on Udemy!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course, you learn how to build a game using portals with Unity® and Blender. This course is unique because we make both the code and the art for the game from scratch. <strong>We teach you the fundamentals of designing, coding, and modeling a 3D game. </strong>⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ <br></p><p>First you design the game and its functionality in Unity®. You learn how to code in C# and build video game levels. Don't worry if you've never coded before. We start simple and add more to the game as the course goes on. </p><p><strong>Why Unity®?</strong></p><p>Unity® is one of the most popular platforms in game development. You can use Unity® to build 2D and 3D games. Unity® is cross-platform, which means it is easy to use with other platforms.</p><p>Then you create the 3D models for the game in Blender. You build all the art assets for the game. You learn how to integrate your art from Blender into Unity®. </p><p><strong>Why Blender?</strong></p><p>Blender, like Unity®, is a popular production suite that is free to download. Blender is a revolutionary tool for making 3D art digitally. With Blender, you can make art assets for games, like we do in this course. <br></p><p>Even if you're not an artist, you can make basic art models. You may have heard of Axiom Verge and Stardew Valley. These games are million-dollar successes. But did you know that only one person made each? </p><p>Usually it takes a whole team of people to build a game. But creators Thomas Happ and Eric Barone developed and designed their games by themselves. Now they're millionaires. You can do it, too.</p><p><strong>Let's get started!</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you a game developer looking to learn gameplay programming in Unreal Engine? Do you want to dive deep into the amazing capabilities of Unreal Engine? If yes, this Learning Path is for you.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unreal Engine has been awarded by Guinness World Records as \"the most successful video game engine\".\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Unreal Engine: Develop Unreal Classic and RTS Games</em> is Packt’s Video Learning Path that is a series of individual video products put together in a logical and stepwise manner such that each video builds on the skills learned in the video before it.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This Path will give you a brief overview of the basics and move quickly to explore the amazing capabilities of Unreal Engine. The design complexity of each game increases gradually to give you a complete overview of Unreal Engine 4 and its amazing features. You will learn to implement advanced shading techniques, create stunning graphics, leverage the rendering power of Unreal Engine to get the best out of it.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Then, you’ll learn to implement an RTS-style free roaming camera from scratch. From there, you’ll  move on to selecting Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) through mouse input, and using basic Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Pathfinding to have selected NPCs move around a level. Then, you will add a second unit to the game, make a unit attack, create destructible environments, and finally bring everything together with an RTS-style user interface using Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG).\n\n \n\n \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The goal of this course is to help you build complex games with Unreal Engine.</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This Learning Path is authored by some of the best in the field.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mike Sill</strong> is a 3D Artist from Cleveland, OH, working in Los Angeles, CA. He has used Epic’s Unreal Engine since 2007 and professionally since 2012. Mike has had the honor of working alongside the likes of Jesse Schell, Patrick Hanenberger, and Dan Gregoire. Mike currently works as an Engine Artist making pre-viz and post-viz sequences for theme parks, Hollywood films, and AAA videogame titles.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jonathan A.

  "description": "<p><strong>Want to make a game? How about <em>two</em> games?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this course, you learn how to build a game using portals <em>and</em> a Zelda clone with Unity® and Blender. This course is unique because we make <strong>both the code and the art </strong>for the game from scratch. We teach you the fundamentals of designing, coding, and modeling a 3D game.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>First you design the game and its functionality in Unity®. You learn how to <strong>code in C#</strong> and <strong>build video game levels</strong>. Don't worry if you've never coded before. We <strong>start simple</strong> and add more to the game as the course goes on.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why Unity®?</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Unity® is one of the most popular platforms in game development. You can use Unity® to build 2D and 3D games. Unity® is cross-platform, which means it is easy to use with other platforms.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Then you create the <strong>3D models</strong> for the game in Blender. You build all the art assets for the game. You learn how to integrate your art from Blender into Unity®.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why Blender?</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Blender, like Unity®, is a popular production suite that is free to download. Blender is a revolutionary tool for making 3D art digitally. With Blender, you can make art assets for games, like we do in this course.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Included in this course is material for beginners to get comfortable with the interfaces.

You may have heard of Axiom Verge and Stardew Valley. These games are million-dollar successes. But did you know that only one person made each?\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Usually it takes a whole team of people to build a game. But creators Thomas Happ and Eric Barone developed and designed their games by themselves. Now they're millionaires. You can do it, too.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Sign up right now to learn a new skill</strong></em></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Colors </strong>play a huge role in games, and more broadly, in real life.</p><p>Many games revolve around the painting / coloring mechanic.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you want to create a wonderful game where your players can color your creations, or even color the world they are in ?</p><p>Then look no further, this Course is for You !</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, we will explore <strong>5 different techniques</strong> you can use to create a coloring game, in Unity.</p><p>Each one of these techniques will see its difficulty level increase.</p><p>As the level of difficulty rises for each of these techniques, so too does the vast expansion of possibilities they offer.</p><p><br></p><p>We will first <strong>Start </strong>with the most basic one, which is coloring a sprite. We will manage the player input to detect any image and color it with the color of your choice.</p><p>In that section, we will get to learn about 2D Raycasts, the Input class, and our sprites sorting order.</p><p><br></p><p>In the <strong>Second Section</strong>, we will experiment with “Line Renderers”. This is a built-in component that allows you to draw, well, lines…</p><p>But we will hack it so that it feels like a paint brush! You will learn how you can apply textures, play with its colored gradient and optimize its performance.</p><p>This will be an additional arrow to your quiver.</p><p><br></p><p>The <strong>Third Technique</strong> will allow you to create infinite worlds if you get it right ! You will learn how to create procedural meshes, texture them using the uvs, and optimize them.</p><p>This is a coloring course, so I’ll show you some nice tricks to use them as a paint brush. But you can totally create 3D objects with this technique, go one step further and create infinite procedural terrains. How amazing is that ?</p><p>Additionally, you will learn how to mask or restraint your drawing to a plane using the Stencil Buffer. That’s a technique that I explain in more details in another course, and you get it for free here.</p><p><br></p><p>After that, you will learn how to manipulate Textures in the <strong>Fourth Section.</strong> This is such an amazing power that you will have in your hands. It will allow you to edit each and every pixel to your liking.</p><p>Using that technique, we will first color the whole texture, then draw a square, and finally polish the look with a smooth rounded brush.</p><p>But that technique has limitations, as you increase the brush size, manipulating textures can be heavy on the processor.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why the <strong>Fifth Section</strong> will show you how to leverage the GPU to get a much higher frame rate, thus a smoother player experience.</p><p>You will learn how to create your own shaders, pass a texture to a shader, let it apply some changes, and get your texture back to apply it to your sprites.</p><p>I’ll show you a nice trick to keep the borders of your drawing, even after it’s been colored. You can then decide if you like the look of it or not.</p><p><br></p><p>To complete our course, we will add colored pencils to the side of the screen, to allow the player to change the brush color.</p><p>We will also add a nice way to select the brush size.</p><p>And this will make, for an amazing coloring game.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will definitely step up your game dev skills, if you’re ready to <strong>Become a Color Master</strong>, </p><p>Grab it, today.</p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course, you will learn how to create a \"Rewarding video\" advertising system. I'm sure you've seen it in many video games, especially on iPhones and Android phones where you can press a button to \"watch a video advertisement\". Once you've finished watch the video ad, you are rewarded with in-game money, or gems, or a new character or a new virtual item.</p><p>It turns out to be<strong> one of the best ways for anyone making game to also make money.</strong></p><p>That's right, as a game developer, you will make money each time the player watches the video advertisement, and your player is more than happy to do so since he or she is rewarded for doing so. It's a WIN-WIN.</p><p>In this course, you will learn how to create the video reward system using Unity 3D. Now we're going to build it from scratch, step by step so that you can recreate it yourself and understand the whole process.</p><p>But we're also going to create this the smart way, we're going to bundle the final system as a <strong>Unity package</strong> so that you can reuse the system easily in any of your Unity projects just by importing the package.</p><p>What a great time saver.</p><p>If you want to make games the right way, just like professionals do, then you need to take this course.</p><p><strong>*** Bonus included! ***</strong></p><p>By the way, as a bonus for joining this course, you get <strong>all the files of the finished reward system package</strong>, ready to use in your games. Sweeeet!</p><p>I intentionally priced this course in a way that anyone can afford it. You'll get your money back just by joining this course and applying the package to your games<strong>. Get in here and let's get started.</strong></p><p>***</p><p><strong>The Power of Video Game Reward Systems*</strong></p><p>Video games contain elaborate reinforcement and reward schedules that have the potential to maximize motivation. Neuro-imaging studies suggest that video games might have an influence on the reward system. However, it is not clear whether reward-related properties represent a precondition, which biases an individual toward playing video games, or if these changes are the result of playing video games. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal study to explore reward-related functional predictors in relation to video gaming experience as well as functional changes in the brain in response to video game training. Fifty healthy participants were randomly assigned to a video game training (TG) or control group (CG). Before and after training/control period, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted using a non-video game related reward task. At pretest, both groups showed strongest activation in ventral striatum (VS) during reward anticipation. At posttest, the TG showed very similar VS activity compared to pretest. In the CG, the VS activity was significantly attenuated. This longitudinal study revealed that video game training may preserve reward responsiveness in the VS in a retest situation over time. We suggest that video games are able to keep stratal responses to reward flexible, a mechanism which might be of critical value for applications such as therapeutic cognitive training.<br></p><p><em>*Source: US National Library of Medicine - National Institutes of Health</em></p><p>Join now and have neuroscience work for you $</p><p>Note: Using Unity version 5 2016</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course, we’re going to be making a 3D physics-based 8-ball pool game using Unity. With that said, the ultimate goal of this course is not to show you how to make an eight-ball pool game per se, the ultimate goal is to use it to help you learn the basic principles of game-making in Unity that will enable you to create your own games.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the prominent features of our game is a real-life physics simulation.</p><p><br></p><p>In other words, in the game that we will be making in this course, the player will be able to make jump shots, that make the ball bounce off the table; and swerve shots, that make the ball move in a curve.</p><p><br></p><p>Another distinct feature of our game is a pretty hard-to-beat AI player. What’s important about the AI part is that while working on it, you will learn how to code complex data-driven game logic, which is a pretty valuable experience.</p><p><br></p><p>In this course we will not only show you how to just make a game in Unity but we will show you how to make a publishable mobile game. The eight-ball pool game that we will use as an example in this course has been published on both Apple’s App Store&nbsp; and Google’s Play Market and we will be making this game with an ultimate publishing goal in mind so that you can get the full experience.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, since we aim to show you how to make a publishable game, we will also show you how to incorporate basic monetization by integrating ads into our project.</p><p><br></p><p>Alright, again, in this course, we’re using eight-ball pool as a learning example, to teach you transferrable skills that you can apply to any other game that you might want to make.</p><p><br></p><p>In order to achieve that, we provide what I like to think of as exhaustive explanation, while in reality, for some of you, it might be exhausting explanation. Therefore, the first chapters of this course have two versions of the same lesson, one with detailed explanation, and one with very little explanation.</p><p><br></p><p>We call them the Fast Track and the Learning Track lessons. So if you already have some experience with Unity, you might want to go for the Fast Track lessons, and switch to the Learning Track when you feel like you might need additional explanation.</p><p><br></p><p>Another feature of this course is based on the idea that learning is never a straight path, meaning quite often when we bump into something new, we cannot fully comprehend it as it requires additional knowledge and practice to become fully palatable.</p><p><br></p><p>So, throughout the entire course, we will be guiding you back to the previous lessons and we encourage you to actually do so. To help you navigate through the course, we have Glossary that contains descriptions of important concepts that you need to know to feel more comfortable with Unity. The Glossary also contains a list of references where the concepts are being explained and applied. In addition to Glossary, in some lessons, we also provide links to our YouTube videos that can give you additional information related to the lesson</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this course is designed for people with no experience with Unity. Zero</p><p><br></p><p>However, if you’re new to programming in general and if you’re not familiar with object-oriented programming, we recommend that you check out our YouTube channel first.</p><p><br></p><p>The main reason why we’re not covering programming in general in this course is simply because Unity is not a good choice for that.</p><p><br></p><p>However, this doesn’t mean that this course is not a good fit if you’re completely new to programming. Just go over the videos that we have on our YouTube channel, and you will be fine.</p><p><br></p><p>Another feature of this course is the prototyping approach. Even though we’ve made and published the game before we started working on this course, we decided to show you a somewhat more natural process of game development where we start simple, with primitive graphics and simple functionality and expand our project throughout the course.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, instead of spending a lot of time perfecting the game controls or the UI, we first create a more primitive version and then polish them in smaller increments. And as we do that, we show you how to fix common bugs and address larger issues that arise when you expand your project.</p><p><br></p><p>We believe this approach is more beneficial for learning as the experiences you get in the process will enable you to address similar issues in other projects that you might be interested to be involved in in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>*Billiard Table Vectors by Vecteezy</p>",

You will learn about sprites, about code blocks that control them, about useful elements like sounds, randomization, sensing, and lots more.

Learning that is not fun is not fun…OK, I suppose that makes sense ;-) Every step of the process is fun, plus what can be more fun than making your very first program a game…and a fun game too!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly we will be using <strong>Scratch</strong> to teach you. Sure you will eventually want to learn programming languages like C++ or Swift or Java…as these will allow you to write mobile apps. However, I have seen countless people give up because these environments are so complex. You need to grasp the basics first…and that is exactly why MIT University developed Scratch. This is the best platform, used at schools and universities around the world, to learn to program. From here your options are limitless!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Thirdly when you learn to program you need to learn it in a <strong>special</strong> way…and that is exactly what we are going to do for you. You will be learning from two people – myself (Craig) and my son, Joshua. I have a PhD in educational technology and have been involved in technology and teaching it for over 30 years. I will share with you the benefit of my knowledge of teaching. Joshua, who began programming at 12, has a passion for programming and sharing it with others. He has written many successful apps and shares his unique skills in this unique course. Together we are going to share with you how you can learn to program and set yourself up for the most needed career of the future. Everything is going to need software to work, whether it's your fridge, watch, phone, car…all of these are programmed. Software is the language of our world, and those who know it hold the key to the future.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What kind of materials are included?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course includes everything you need. The lectures are professionally created, as people have come to expect from my courses. We will explain everything to you and give you access to the source code files in Scratch. Plus in addition to this we have attached additional exercises with solutions to the end of most lessons. This means you can try other things to see if you have grasped the concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How long will the course take to complete?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There are 3 sections to this course, with each section providing short powerful videos on individual concepts. Learning to become proficient in programming takes time…but this course will give you a jump start into what is one of the most needed and lucrative careers around…ask Mark Zuckerberg if your don't believe us!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How is this course structured?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This is an action course. So the course starts with getting to the doing straight away. The course starts with setting up your Scratch account and then in no time you have written your first program. The course is structured in the following way:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.Section 1 – Introduction to Programming in Scratch</strong> - The purpose of this first section is to introduce you to the importance of programming, and the Scratch programming environment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.Section 2 – Making the Flappy Bird game</strong> - In this section we will guide you in a step-by-step way through the building of the Flappy Bird game.

  "description": "<p>If you’re interested in learning how to <strong>make your own Artificially Intelligent games using Python</strong>, then this is the course for you!</p><p>This course is full of tutorial videos along with materials which one can run to get familiar with this discipline. You no longer need to read <strong>complex research papers</strong> and have a solid foundation in <strong>mathematics</strong> to get going. Just follow this course and materials and you’re on your way.</p><p><strong>Let's take a look at the structure of this course:</strong></p><p>We are going to start with a simple game that implements popular board game algorithm:&nbsp;MinMax. In this game we are going to create TicTacToe and write an algorithm that plays against human player and tries to beat human player.</p><p>Next we are going to learn about <strong>gym </strong>module:&nbsp;a popular library which can be used to write and test our AI algorithms.</p><p>After that, we are going to learn about Bellman Equation and Dynamic Programming. We are going to learn how to find the optimal value of the states using Bellman equations through model dynamics. We are going to implement maze game to implement Q-learning algorithm.</p><p>Then, we are going to learn about Monte-Carlo Simulation. We are going to check how value function can be predicted using Monte Carlo simulation when model dynamics is unknown.</p><p>Similarly, we are going to implement following games throughout this course:</p><p>1. <strong>BlackJack game</strong> using Monte-Carlo and Q-Learning</p><p>2. <strong>Pacman</strong> using Deep Convolution Neural Network</p><p>3. Make unbeatable <strong>AI TicTacToe</strong> player using Tensorflow and Keras <strong>(Human Vs AI)</strong></p><p>4.<strong> MinMax algorithm</strong> for Board game</p><p><strong>General Q/A's: </strong></p><p>When most people hear the term <strong>artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots</strong>. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence include mimicking human cognitive activity. Researchers and developers in the field are making surprisingly rapid strides in mimicking activities such as learning, reasoning, and perception, to the extent that these can be concretely defined. Some believe that innovators may soon be able to develop systems that exceed the capacity of humans to learn or reason out any subject. But others remain skeptical because all cognitive activity is laced with value judgments that are subject to human experience.</p><p><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.</p>",

You’ll also delve into creating PBR materials from these textures to decorate rooms and furniture in Unity.</p><p>In the sprite generation section, you’ll learn to install and use the Muse Sprite Generator, explore adding extra characteristics to your prompts, and create your own sprite styles using the Style Trainer. By the end of this section, you’ll have the skills to generate and refine 2D backgrounds, and edit sprites to meet your desired outcomes.</p><p>The course also covers the Muse Animate module, where you’ll gain a quick overview of its features, set up characters, and use Muse-generated animations. You’ll get a crash course in walk cycles, explore animation curves, and learn how to manipulate and manually adjust animation keyframes to add custom actions.</p><p>Finally, you’ll dive into the Muse Behavior Tree tool, where you’ll create and debug behavior trees, learn how to script custom actions using generative AI and use Muse Chat to create simple scripts, modify code, and even develop procedural terrain. </p><p>This course concludes with advanced techniques for improving your AI prompts, ensuring you get the most out of Muse Chat.</p><p>Course Highlights:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Latent Diffusion &amp; Texture Generation:</strong> Understand the fundamentals of generative AI and create seamless textures for your game objects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sprite &amp; Animation Creation:</strong> Learn to generate and refine sprites, set up character animations, and control animation curves for smooth, lifelike motions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Behavior Trees &amp; AI Programming:</strong> Build complex behavior trees, script actions using AI, and learn to debug and optimize your code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Muse Chat Integration:</strong> Create scripts and procedural content with AI assistance, enhancing your coding capabilities and learning how to modify and expand AI-generated code.</p></li></ul><p>By the end of \"Mastering Unity Muse,\" you’ll be equipped with the skills to harness the Muse Generative AI tool, bringing your creative visions to life with ease and precision. Join us on this exciting journey into the future of game development with AI!</p><p><strong>What others are saying about Penny's courses:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Andrew C:&nbsp; <em>Another amazing course. Goes into a lot of depth without feeling overwhelming. Very step by step and easy to follow. The course gives a lot of insight into the math underlying common operations. I will definitely be able to use this to understand what happened when things go wrong, and also build my own lower level code. A+.</em></p></li><li><p>Pierce K: <em>Penny's courses are great -- I keep going back for more. </em></p></li><li><p>Bertan Ç: <em>As a game developer with 3+ years experience under his belt, I would like to say that I have learned a lot, and also improved on what I knew already before the course. The instructor and the course is very easy to follow, and I believe people from all experience levels could learn something from this course. Thank you!</em></p></li></ul>",

Using playMaker's Finite State Machines you will see how to build this game from the ground up, step by step.  </p><p><strong>The Fun Way To Learn Game Design</strong></p><p>Like our other highly rated courses we start at the very beginning. Even someone new to playMaker and Unity can follow along. We begin by walking you through how to setup the project and install playmaker. We layout a basic interface for our game and then we create some simple FSM states to begin implementing the turn system of our game.  But we don't just keep it simple and basic for long. This course is designed for ambitious developers who want to learn important game design techniques and are not afraid to jump in feet first. We waste no time in delving into more advanced design patterns that will teach you how to build virtually any game in playMaker and Unity.</p><p><strong>Intermediate and Advanced Level playMaker </strong></p><p>The goal of this course is to take you from a beginning game designer to someone who is very capable of putting together increasingly complex games and applications. While this course uses Unity &amp; playMaker, the game design techniques and patterns you will be learning will apply to virtually any language. As you progress through the course you will learn how to smartly structure your game objects and FSMs. You will learn how to use loops, nested loops, and dependency injection to create game objects on the fly. You will learn how to create reusable FSM's and will gain confidence in adding new features to the game.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Important:</strong> <strong>all software used are FREE to download and use on PC, LINUX and MAC computers</strong> (no need to pay, cheers!)</p><p>In this course you will learn how to build a system to add attributes, and modifier to game characters, weapons and gear items.&nbsp;</p><p>Why would you want to learn how to build this? Because it creates engaging games where players get to explore worlds, find items and weapons to make their character stronger, and get to fight enemies and powerful bosses that drop loot when defeated. By the way some of the most common attributes are health points, strength, dexterity, intelligence, spell damage, and attack speed.</p><p>All the great games out there use stats, look at Zelda, or World of Warcraft or MineCraft or even Star Wars. That's exactly what you will get&nbsp;to build by taking this course.</p><p>This course can be taken by anyone even if you've got no programming skills. This course is meant for non-artists, meaning you don't have to be an artist to be able to use 3D pixel art graphics since this course provides all the necessary assets for you. The only tool we use in this course is Unity 3D, and it's completely free to use. No need to spend extra money.</p><p>This course is easy to follow along since all the steps are shown to you in the video lectures, so you can't possibly miss a step, and it's a lot more fun that reading documentation</p><p>The skills that are taught in this course are the foundation of any professional video games and they can be applied to all your future projects.&nbsp;</p><p>Join the course now, you've got nothing to lose because if i don't deliver, you'll get a full refund. I'll see you in the videos lectures and in the course forum.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Ready to <strong>level up your Blender skills</strong>? Our new Simulation Nodes course is your ticket. We’ll help you go beyond basics and dive into Geometry Nodes. It’s where the magic happens.</p><p>In this course, you’ll <strong>make simulations that work flawlessly</strong>, no matter the frame rate. Switch between 30 FPS and 60 FPS without a hitch. Smooth and seamless, just the way you want it.</p><p>We’ll teach you how to <strong>create everything from gravity systems to particle effects</strong>. You’ll even get into boid behaviour—think insects that interact with their environment in a realistic way.</p><p>Get ready to make fireworks explode like never before. Morph objects with <strong>particle effects</strong> and trigger simulations to start or stop with <strong>advanced Boolean math</strong>. Don’t worry, we’ll keep it easy!</p><p>If <strong>Blender’s regular physics feel limiting, this course is for you</strong>. We’ll guide you to a node-based workflow that’s more intuitive and customisable. Say goodbye to clunky systems.</p><p>Geometry Nodes are your <strong>cheat codes to non-destructive workflows.</strong> They update automatically with scene changes, so you never have to start from scratch. It’s all about working smarter.</p><p>This course is perfect if you know your way around Blender and have dabbled with nodes. By the end, you’ll be creating simulations that’ll make others wonder how you did it.</p><p>All you need is Blender 4.2 LTS and some basic node knowledge. A decent PC helps, especially for heavier simulations. But trust us, the results will be worth it. </p><p>Let’s create something awesome together!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Welcome</strong></p><p>This course is an easy and straightforward introduction into UI programming with C++. The course is segmented into short and on point lessons that focus on concrete topics. In this course you will learn how to initialize a window and graphics and then create various elements with a library called ImGui.</p><p>To participate and learn from this course, you should already know C++ at a good level since the basics of programming won't be covered. Otherwise this course is appropriate for junior developers that are familiar with the language. The level of C++ will be kept easy to grasp with no complicated concepts outside of basic OOP.</p><p><strong>Libraries</strong></p><p>Through the course you will learn how to use a few different libraries. Learning these will generally help you understand a few more concepts than just the UI programming bit. The few major libraries that I've included in the course are:<br></p><ul><li><p>GLFW—a library used to create and manage windows in your GUI&nbsp;environment. This is an abstraction library over the native interfaces of windows, Mac and Linux windows.</p></li><li><p>BGFX—a popular cross-platform library for rendering graphics onto a window. Similar to how GLFW is an abstraction over the native windows - bgfx represents an abstraction over Vulkan, OpenGL, DirectX, etc. This library is used by major developers, including Microsoft's Minecraft.</p></li><li><p>GLM—a simple math library which we will use mainly for the 2D vector calculations for sizes and positions of UI elements in the window.</p></li><li><p>Dear, ImGui—an immediate mode UI library. You define the UI through code, and it issues commands for GLFW and BGFX to be rendered. Each frame is drawn immediately from the issued commands, which also means that each frame you need to redefine the UI. This is usually easier to work with from a programmer stand point.</p></li></ul><p>This course is primarily taught on the Windows OS, but the knowledge gained can easily translate into other operating systems as well.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Tower defence games are continuing to gain in popularity online. In this course I am going to show you how to create your own zombie tower defence game.</p><p>When I was creating this course I was initially thinking, should it be an overhead tower defence style game, or should it be a first person shooter style game. Well, when you have two great ideas, why not combine them. So this is a Hybrid of both overhead point and click as well as first person shooter.</p><p>The techniques covered in this course can be used to make any type of defence style games. Think of this as a template that you can use again and again and you can customise the game any way you like to realise your vision.</p><p>So what is covered in the course:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>We develop a system for placing props into the level, with the ability to change items using an easy to create User Interface</p></li><li><p>Items can be placed freehand, or by pressing the spacebar, can be made to snap together either horizontally or vertically</p></li><li><p>Each item will have different purposes. Some will simply block the zombies, some will damage the zombies, some will blow them up, and in the case of the gun turrets, these will target and shoot the zombies</p></li><li><p>Once you have laid out your items the zombies will then begin spawning into the scene and you will enter into first person mode</p></li><li><p>You can change between overhead and first person modes to quickly navigate the map</p></li><li><p>We will setup a range of weapon types, ammo amounts and damage styles for each weapon, including sniper scope for the sniper rifle</p></li><li><p>You will have access to six zombies that I created for this course. You can use them in any of your other games too</p></li><li><p>The objective is to defend the tower. You must kill all the zombies on each level to unlock the next level</p></li></ul><p>This course can be taken by anyone using the free Unity game engine. A basic understanding of C# code is suggested for you to make the most of this course. By the end of the course you will have another completed game in your portfolio. You will have developed your skills to an intermediate level and be ready to make your own Unity games.</p><p>So why not enroll today, and I look forward to seeing you in my course.</p><p>Thanks to the artists from Sketchfab for their 3D models used in this course</p>",

  "description": "<p>This lesson summarizes all that I have learned from my experience in publishing our first mobile game so your experience in making your own mobile game will go more smoothly. In this lesson, I’ll show you some of the issues I had building a game on mobile. We will discuss things like limitations in joint count, polygon count, and shader complexity. Then we will go through the process of setting up Unreal for developing for Android. We’ll show how to install the correct Android SDK for Unreal and how to move from development to deployment. We’ll upload our game to the Google Play store and set up things like achievements, leaderboard, and in-app purchases. From there we’ll port our project over to the Mac using Mac-In-Cloud, get our mobile provisioning profiles from the Apple Developer site, and upload our game to iTunes Connect.</p><p><strong>More about the Instructor:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Chad Morgan started his career at LucasArts where, as a newbie to the industry, was fortunate enough to work with some very talented mentors who taught him how to use Maya. Ever since then, Chad has been trying to pay it forward by sharing what he has learned, first by giving lectures at Autodesk Master Classes, then publishing an article in #d world Magazine, posting tutorials on YouTube, and finally teaming up with 3dmotive. Chad Morgan currently lives in Lake Forest, CA with his wife Carol and his son Xander.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Making a Video game can be a fun but also very challenging Task. It is all about getting familiar with the process.</p><p>In this course, we try to breakdown the game development process by building a fun archery game that can be played on both&nbsp;Windows and Mac Os. We will be using the Unity game engine and work with its various subsystems.</p><p><strong>In this Unity course, you will:</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Master C# concepts such as variables and if statements</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Detect collisions, receive user input, and create player movements</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Collect and destroy game objects</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Build the Animation Systems</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Control objects influenced by the physics system</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Implement sound effects, background music, and particle effects</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Navigate the Unity Engine and discover unique features such as the Asset Store</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>And more!</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this course we will first start with a blank project, then set up the environment for our game and later we'll dive into the scripting. We will walk step by step through every line of code we write. Though it is essential to be familiar with scripting to get most out of this course, there is still a lot to learn about programming games as we try our best to cover and explain the absolute basics.</p><p>Further, we will also learn how to use animated objects with Unity's physics system and learn concepts like Quaternions to deal with rotations. We will also add collectibles in the game and an Enemy bird AI<strong>.</strong></p><p>This course will help you&nbsp;build commercial quality games with polished assets and cinematic effects. Get access to the unique artwork provided by&nbsp;this Unity course and add sophisticated features to your games that make you look like you’ve been programming for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>By the end, we will have a fun game that can be shared with others.</strong></p><p><strong>Why Learn Game Development with Unity?</strong></p><p>The gaming industry is a $100 billion&nbsp;industry worldwide. By 2020, that number is expected to near $120 billion. With&nbsp;<strong>Unity being the most widely used engine to develop games across multiple platforms</strong>, there has never been a better time to get into the field. As you will learn, the types of games you can create with Unity and C# are limitless. Game development makes a great hobby, allowing you to learn a new skill and play your game with family and friends. It is also an exciting and rewarding career, where&nbsp;plenty of successful&nbsp;developers, have learned the&nbsp;fundamentals of game development through courses like this, and not in the traditional classroom setting.&nbsp;<strong>Every great game starts somewhere, so why not make it yours?&nbsp;</strong>While people often find coding or making games intimidating, this Unity course utilizes a unique teaching method that will allow you to gain a thorough understanding of concepts while you develop your games. Thanks to the Unity community, you’ll be able to connect with other developers, work together on new projects, and make some incredible games!</p><p>Everyone using the Unity engine will benefit since we comprehensively cover how to correctly use many of it's more advanced systems e.g., navigation and pathfinding, animation state machines, physics, and so on.</p><p><strong>Join us on this adventure today! &nbsp;We’ll see you inside the course.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",

Take advantage of this while it's still there.</em></strong><em><br></em></p><p><em>Welcome to the </em><strong><em>Learn To Make Epic Low Poly Scenes In Unity [Intermediate] ! </em></strong><em> This course should be taken if you've already took the </em><strong><em>Learn To Make Epic Low Poly Scenes In Unity [Beginner] </em></strong><em>course. The purpose if this course is to enhance what you've already learned in the beginner course and introduce new things like Shaders, apply new modeling techniques and much more! In terms of Plants VS Zombies this is practically the second wave. This course will be semi fast pace and it should prepare you to the </em><strong><em>Learn To Make Epic Low Poly Scenes In Unity [Advanced].</em></strong></p><p>In this course I will teach you how to create the <strong>Swamp Blue Scene</strong>. Keep in mind this course is targeted for<strong> intermediate</strong> users in Maya, Zbrush, Unity &amp; Photoshop. If this course is too fast for you, I suggest taking the <strong>Beginner</strong> course first where we created the <em>Portal Green Scene</em> from scratch and went through all basics and fundamentals.  Its best to have fundamental understanding first before shortcuting your way through everything so at least you understand the process &amp; you don't miss out on basics.</p><p><strong>In this course, you will learn to apply &amp; enhance what you've learned on the beginner course which are below:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Organizing &amp; Structured Planning</strong></p></li></ul><p>-You will learn how to plan out, structure, and manage your ideas so you can work efficiently.</p><p>-You will be exposed to different art resources and game development community so not only me but other professionals can help you.  </p><ul><li><p><strong>Model Efficiently in Maya 2018 and Zbrush 4r7 &amp; 4r8</strong></p></li></ul><p>-You will learn the basics and workflow of modeling from Maya to Zbrush.</p><p>-You will learn how to freestyle, find your own art style &amp; most specially enjoy working on your craft. </p><p>-Maya and Zbrush interface will be as familiar as your hands. </p><ul><li><p><strong>Color Theory &amp; Color Schemes</strong></p></li></ul><p>-You will be profoundly familiar with the fundamentals of Color Theory and Color Schemes.</p><p>-You will learn how to effectively learn, remember everything you ever study, and most importantly achieve any goals you've set for yourself.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Create Gradient Textures</strong></p></li></ul><p>-Creating palettes and making color combinations will be one of your specialties.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Import/Export</strong></p></li></ul><p>-Having unclean import/export with a lot of errors will be a thing in the past.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Set Up Scene In Unity</strong></p></li></ul><p>-You will learn how to design and set up a scene in Unity.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lighting Scenes In Unity</strong></p></li></ul><p>-With all the knowledge you've accumulated in Color Theory, lighting using different Color Schemes will make all your creations stunning and beautiful.  </p><ul><li><p><strong>Unity Particle Effects</strong></p></li></ul><p>-You will learn how to create a mass variety of VFX (particle effects) in Unity that will elevate your scenes or game to the degree of a pro. </p><p><em>Keep in mind I am not going into details of what we've already learned on the Beginner Class.
