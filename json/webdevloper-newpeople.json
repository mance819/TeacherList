  "description": "<p>Welcome to Backend Development with Golang, Python, Flask, and MongoDB course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn how to build two backend projects. The first one is inventory management system and the second is restaurant reservation system. This course is a perfect combination between backend development and database integration, making it an ideal opportunity to practice your programming skills while improving your technical knowledge in software development. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of backend development, such as getting to know CRUD operations, learn how to connect backend systems with databases, and also getting to know common issues in backend. Then, in the next section, we will install Golang and set up a MongoDB database, making sure your development environment is fully ready. Afterwards, we will start the first project. We are going to build an inventory management system using Golang. Firstly, we are going to create CRUD operations, enabling users to Add New Items, Update Items, and Delete Items. For each item, we will use a consistent data structure that includes name, SKU, quantity, price, supplier name, category, reorder Point, and lead time. Then, after that, we are also going to build an inventory dashboard where users can view all items, search and sort items by name, category and stock level. Additionally, the users will also be able to monitor the quantity of each item in real time and most importantly, the data will be updated whenever items are added, sold, or removed. Following that, we are going to create a low stock notification which will automatically alert users when the quantity of an item falls below its reorder point, helping to prevent stockouts. The inventory management system will also have reports and analytics tab, where users can view total items, low stock items, total inventory value, and visual charts representing stock level by category and average lead time by category. Meanwhile, in the second project, we are going to build a restaurant table reservation system using Python, Flask, and MongoDB. Firstly, we are going to create CRUD operations, the users will be able to add table reservation, update reservation, and cancel reservation, additionally, they can also select the date and time for their booking. Each reservation will use a structured data format including customer name, number of guests, and table number. Then, the second feature that we are going to build is a table management system. This feature will enable staff to efficiently track and manage table availability and capacity in real time, ensuring that reservations are allocated correctly. In addition, we are also going to build a waitlist management system, which automatically adds customers to a waiting list when all tables are full. We are also going to integrate the backend system with a MongoDB database, allowing the restaurant to store, retrieve, and update reservation data efficiently. Lastly, at the end of the course, we are going to conduct testing to make sure the systems have been fully functioning and all features are working as intended.</p><p>Firstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we learn about backend development? Well, here is my answer, the backend is the engine of any application or software, it handles data storage, processes user requests, and enables communication between UI and database, which is what makes the application functional.</p><p>Below are things that you can expect to learn from this course:</p><ul><li><p>Learn the basic fundamentals of backend development, CRUD operations, and learn how to connect backend with database</p></li><li><p>Learn how to build inventory management system with Golang</p></li><li><p>Learn how to build restaurant reservation system with Python, Flask, and MongoDB</p></li><li><p>Learn how to build data models and system core structure</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create backend logics and implement CRUD operations</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create HTTP handlers and define routes</p></li><li><p>Learn how to design user interface and create HTML template</p></li><li><p>Learn how to design inventory dashboard UI</p></li><li><p>Learn how to design analytics and reporting tab UI</p></li><li><p>Learn how to setup MongoDB database and create cluster</p></li><li><p>Learn how to build Flask app and connect backend with MongoDB database</p></li><li><p>Learn how to design restaurant reservation website UI and create utility functions</p></li><li><p>Learn how to build restaurant reservation dashboard</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create function to add reservation</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create function to display reservation data</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create function to edit and cancel reservation</p></li><li><p>Learn how to build and design table management system</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create waitlist management system</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>Are you ready to take your PHP skills to the next level and build real-world backend applications?In this course, you’ll learn <strong>how to build a fully functional RESTful API in PHP</strong> — completely from scratch — using <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong>, and <strong>JWT authentication</strong> for secure access.</p><p>We’ll start simple and gradually build up to a complete backend system that allows you to <strong>create, read, update, and delete data (CRUD)</strong>, authenticate users, and <strong>protect your routes</strong> using modern security techniques. Unlike many tutorials that skip important concepts, this course explains everything in detail and helps you understand <em>why</em> things work — not just how.</p><p>You’ll learn how to structure your PHP projects cleanly with <strong>separate folders for controllers, models, and core logic</strong>, and use <strong>autoloading (via spl_autoload_register)</strong> to load your classes efficiently without relying on frameworks.</p><p>Once your CRUD API is working, we’ll integrate <strong>JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</strong> using the <strong>Firebase PHP-JWT</strong> library. You’ll learn how to generate, verify, and decode tokens — and how to protect your routes so only authenticated users can access or modify data. We’ll even go one step further by implementing a <strong>logout system with token blacklisting</strong>, ensuring that once a user logs out, their token becomes invalid.</p><p>You’ll also learn how to <strong>test your API using Postman</strong>, handle different HTTP request types, and return proper JSON responses with correct status codes.</p><p>By the end of this course, you’ll have a <strong>complete, secure REST API</strong> ready to integrate with any frontend — whether it’s a mobile app, a JavaScript SPA, or another backend system.</p><p>This course is perfect for <strong>students, beginners, and freelancers</strong> who want to master PHP API development, understand backend security, and gain real project experience.</p><p>Get ready to <strong>code like a professional backend developer</strong> — one endpoint at a time!</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>A warm welcome to<strong> Angular: Build Modern, Scalable, and Dynamic Web Applications </strong>course by <strong>Uplatz</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is Angular?</strong></p><p><strong>Angular</strong> is a TypeScript-based, open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It is used to build dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) and enterprise-grade frontends. Angular provides a complete ecosystem for developing client-side applications, including tools for routing, forms, HTTP requests, dependency injection, and more.</p><p>It follows a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create modular and reusable UI elements. Angular is widely used for building modern, scalable, and maintainable applications for the web.</p><p>In summary, Angular is a <strong>robust frontend framework</strong> designed for building modern web applications. It works by:</p><ul><li><p>Using components to structure UI</p></li><li><p>Enabling data binding for real-time DOM updates</p></li><li><p>Applying directives to manipulate the view</p></li><li><p>Utilizing services and DI for shared logic</p></li><li><p>Supporting routing, forms, HTTP calls, and reactive programming</p></li></ul><p>With its all-in-one architecture, Angular makes it easier to build scalable, maintainable, and high-performance web apps.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How Angular Works</strong></p><p>Angular works by binding your application logic (written in TypeScript) to the user interface (written in HTML) through a series of powerful concepts:</p><p><strong>1. Component-Based Architecture</strong></p><ul><li><p>Everything in Angular is built using <strong>components</strong>.</p></li><li><p>A component includes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>HTML template</strong> – the view</p></li><li><p><strong>TypeScript class</strong> – the logic</p></li><li><p><strong>CSS styles</strong> – the design</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Components are reusable and form the building blocks of an Angular application.</p></li></ul><p><strong>2. Data Binding</strong></p><ul><li><p>Angular uses <strong>data binding</strong> to synchronize data between the model (component) and the view (template).</p></li><li><p><strong>Types of data binding:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Interpolation</em> – {{ expression }}</p></li><li><p><em>Property binding</em> – [property]=\"value\"</p></li><li><p><em>Event binding</em> – (event)=\"handlerFunction()\"</p></li><li><p><em>Two-way binding</em> – [(ngModel)]=\"property\"</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>3. Directives</strong></p><ul><li><p>Directives modify the behavior or appearance of elements in the DOM.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Structural directives</strong> (e.g., *ngIf, *ngFor) change the structure of the DOM.</p></li><li><p><strong>Attribute directives</strong> (e.g., [ngClass], [ngStyle]) change the appearance or behavior.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>4. Services and Dependency Injection</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Services</strong> in Angular are used to share data or logic across multiple components.</p></li><li><p>Angular uses <strong>Dependency Injection (DI)</strong> to manage service instances efficiently and promote code reusability.</p></li></ul><p><strong>5. Routing</strong></p><ul><li><p>Angular’s <strong>Router module</strong> enables navigation between different views or pages.</p></li><li><p>Routes can be static, dynamic (with parameters), or lazily loaded for performance.</p></li></ul><p><strong>6. Forms</strong></p><ul><li><p>Supports <strong>template-driven</strong> and <strong>reactive forms</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Offers built-in validation, error handling, and dynamic form controls.</p></li></ul><p><strong>7. HTTP Client</strong></p><ul><li><p>Angular includes a <strong>HttpClient module</strong> for making API calls (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to backend services.</p></li></ul><p><strong>8. RxJS and Observables</strong></p><ul><li><p>Angular uses <strong>RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript)</strong> to handle asynchronous data via <strong>observables</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Useful for handling HTTP requests, user input, and other reactive patterns.</p></li></ul><p><strong>9. Compilation</strong></p><ul><li><p>Angular applications are compiled using:</p><ul><li><p><strong>JIT (Just-In-Time)</strong> – during development</p></li><li><p><strong>AOT (Ahead-Of-Time)</strong> – before deployment for better performance</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>What You’ll Learn in this Angular Course</strong></p><ul><li><p>Understand Angular fundamentals, setup, and architecture</p></li><li><p>Build and manage reusable components and services</p></li><li><p>Use data binding, event handling, and directives like ngIf, ngFor, ngSwitch</p></li><li><p>Implement reactive and template-driven forms with validations</p></li><li><p>Configure routing, 404 handling, and lazy loading</p></li><li><p>Work with Angular Signals, Effects, and Computed values</p></li><li><p>Call REST APIs and perform CRUD operations using HttpClient</p></li><li><p>Build real-world projects and deploy them to Vercel</p></li><li><p>Style apps using Tailwind CSS and Angular’s dynamic styling features</p></li><li><p>Use RxJS, Observables, and Dependency Injection effectively</p></li><li><p>Optimize Angular app performance with best practices</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Who This Course Is For</strong></p><ul><li><p>Beginners who want to learn Angular from scratch</p></li><li><p>JavaScript or TypeScript developers expanding into frontend frameworks</p></li><li><p>Frontend developers looking to upskill with Angular 19</p></li><li><p>Full-stack developers working on enterprise applications</p></li><li><p>Freelancers or consultants building SPAs for clients</p></li><li><p>Students and career switchers targeting Angular-based job roles</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Angular: Build Modern, Scalable, and Dynamic Web Applications -

This approach ensures you're not just memorizing answers but truly mastering the material.</p><p><strong>Comprehensive Coverage Across 6 Critical Sections:</strong></p><p><strong>Section 1: NLP Fundamentals and Text Preprocessing</strong><br>Master the essential building blocks including text cleaning, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, text encoding methods, regular expressions, handling special characters, sentence segmentation, and preprocessing pipelines.</p><p><strong>Section 2: Machine Learning for NLP</strong><br>Dive deep into statistical methods, feature engineering, Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, n-gram models, classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forests), clustering techniques, dimensionality reduction, topic modeling with LDA, evaluation metrics, hyperparameter tuning, and text similarity measures.</p><p><strong>Section 3: Deep Learning for NLP</strong><br>Build expertise in neural network architectures specifically designed for text, including word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText), recurrent neural networks (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs), attention mechanisms, transformer fundamentals, sequence-to-sequence models, language modeling, text generation, and transfer learning techniques.</p><p><strong>Section 4: Advanced NLP Models and Architectures</strong><br>Stay ahead with modern architectures including BERT and its variants (RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT), GPT family models, T5 framework, multilingual models (XLM-R), sentence embeddings (Sentence-BERT), model compression techniques, prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, bias mitigation, and adversarial robustness.</p><p><strong>Section 5: NLP Applications and Use Cases</strong><br>Apply your knowledge to real-world scenarios including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition applications, question answering systems, machine translation, text summarization (extractive and abstractive), dialogue systems, speech recognition, multimodal NLP, social media analysis, fake news detection, and domain-specific applications in healthcare, finance, and legal domains.</p><p><strong>Section 6: NLP Tools, Deployment, and Best Practices</strong><br>Gain practical skills with industry-standard tools including NLTK, SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and deployment strategies using FastAPI, Flask, Docker, and cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure). Learn about CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, security best practices, ethical considerations, cost optimization, and team collaboration workflows.</p><p><strong>Sample Questions with Detailed Explanations:</strong></p><p><strong>Question 1:</strong> What is the primary purpose of lemmatization in text preprocessing?<br>A) To reduce words to their root form by removing prefixes and suffixes<br>B) To convert words to their base dictionary form considering context<br>C) To remove stop words from the text<br>D) To convert all characters to lowercase</p><p><strong>Correct Answer: B</strong><br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Lemmatization reduces words to their base or dictionary form (lemma) while considering the context and part of speech. Unlike stemming, which simply chops off prefixes and suffixes, lemmatization uses vocabulary and morphological analysis to return the correct base form. For example, \"better\" would lemmatize to \"good\" (considering it's the comparative form), whereas stemming might incorrectly produce \"bet.\" This contextual understanding makes lemmatization more accurate but computationally more expensive than stemming.</p><p><strong>Question 2:</strong> In the Transformer architecture, what is the purpose of positional encoding?<br>A) To encode the semantic meaning of words<br>B) To provide information about the position of tokens in the sequence<br>C) To normalize the attention weights<br>D) To reduce the dimensionality of word embeddings</p><p><strong>Correct Answer: B</strong><br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Positional encoding is crucial in Transformer architectures because unlike RNNs, Transformers process all tokens simultaneously and have no inherent understanding of token order. Positional encoding injects information about the relative or absolute position of tokens in the sequence by adding sinusoidal functions of different frequencies to the token embeddings. This allows the model to leverage sequential information despite its parallel processing nature, enabling it to understand that \"the cat chased the dog\" has a different meaning than \"the dog chased the cat.\"</p><p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Which evaluation metric is most appropriate for assessing the quality of machine translation output?<br>A) Accuracy<br>B) F1-Score<br>C) BLEU Score<br>D) Mean Squared Error</p><p><strong>Correct Answer: C</strong><br><strong>Explanation:</strong> BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score is specifically designed for evaluating machine translation quality by measuring the overlap between machine-generated translations and human reference translations. It calculates precision at the n-gram level and includes a brevity penalty to discourage overly short translations. While accuracy and F1-score are useful for classification tasks, and MSE is for regression, BLEU accounts for the nuances of translation quality including fluency and adequacy. Modern alternatives like ROUGE are better suited for summarization, while METEOR provides additional synonym matching capabilities.</p><p><strong>Why This Course Stands Out:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>1400+ High-Quality Questions:</strong> Extensive coverage ensures no topic is left unexplored</p></li><li><p><strong>Detailed Explanations:</strong> Every answer includes comprehensive reasoning, not just the correct choice</p></li><li><p><strong>Progressive Difficulty:</strong> Questions range from fundamental concepts to advanced implementation details</p></li><li><p><strong>Real Interview Focus:</strong> Questions are curated based on actual interviews at top tech companies</p></li><li><p><strong>Lifetime Access:</strong> Practice anytime, anywhere with regular updates to keep content current</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance Tracking:</strong> Monitor your progress across all six sections to identify weak areas</p></li><li><p><strong>Practical Relevance:</strong> Explanations connect theory to real-world applications and industry best practices</p></li></ul><p>This course is your ultimate preparation tool for NLP Engineer positions at leading technology companies, research institutions, and startups. By mastering these questions and understanding the underlying concepts, you'll walk into your interview with confidence and the knowledge to succeed.

  "description": "<p>ASP.NET Core 9.0 with Native Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation is a game changer for modern .NET development. It allows developers to build high-performance, lightweight, and self-contained applications that run faster, use less memory, and are ideal for cloud, Docker, and cross-platform deployments. This course, <em>ASP.NET Core 9.0 API Native AOT: The Essential Guide</em>, is designed to give you step-by-step training in building and deploying real-world APIs with Native AOT.</p><p><br></p><p>We begin with the core fundamentals: an introduction to Native AOT, a clear comparison of JIT versus AOT for .NET developers, and guidance on setting up your development environment with .NET 9.0 SDK and Visual Studio 2022. You will then create your first ASPNET Core 9.0 Native AOT project, run and debug it, and publish native executables for Windows, Linux, and macOS, including Apple Silicon (arm64). This ensures you understand how Native AOT applications behave across platforms.</p><p><br></p><p>From there, we move into practical ASPNET Core API development. You will build RESTful APIs with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints, generate OpenAPI documentation and clients using Scalar, and implement real-world features such as a calculator API and file upload/download endpoints. You will also learn how to implement dependency injection, configure appsettings.json in an AOT-friendly way, and use LINQ in ASP.NET Core 9.0 Native AOT applications.</p><p><br></p><p>Modern deployment is a major focus of this course. You will run your Native AOT APIs inside Docker containers, explore ORM and database access options that work with AOT, and build SQL Server CRUD APIs using ADO .NET. Finally, you will publish and run ASP.NET Core 9.0 Native AOT APIs with SQL Server on Windows and Linux, and deploy them as containers that connect to SQL Server.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is essential for .NET developers who want to learn ASP.NET Core 9.0 API development with Native AOT in a practical, hands-on way. The focus is on building real projects, publishing cross-platform executables, running inside Docker, and connecting to SQL Server. By the end of the course, you will have the skills to create fast, lean, and production-ready APIs using ASP.NET Core 9.0 with Native AOT for Windows, Linux, macOS, and containerized environments.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This second volume focuses on the data layer, Eloquent ORM, advanced framework features (“Digging Deeper”).</p><p><strong>How you’ll learn</strong><br>This course is built around interactive MCQ practice tests 100% aligned to the official documentation. Instead of reading end-to-end, you’ll diagnose gaps, focus on essentials, and jump straight to the right doc page after each question. Explanations are elaborative (not just right/wrong) and include why other options are wrong.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The goal is for you to learn actively, quickly close knowledge gaps, and develop the habit of relying on primary sources.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Benefits of this approach</strong></p><p><strong>Active recall:</strong> you’re not reading passively - you think and check yourself actively, which makes knowledge stick.</p><p><strong>Smart feedback:</strong> you don’t just get “correct/incorrect”; you understand <em>why</em> and <em>where</em> you were wrong (it closes gaps immediately).</p><p><strong>Habituating documentation use:</strong> I point you straight to the relevant passages in the official docs - you build the habit of checking the source of truth.</p><p><strong>On-the-fly diagnostics:</strong> every answer maps your strengths/weaknesses by section - you study <em>exactly where it hurts</em>.</p><p><strong>Learning from mistakes:</strong> the moment you realize <em>why</em> something is wrong is the moment you remember it most deeply.</p><p><strong>Broad coverage:</strong> question by question, we cover the “edges” and special cases most tutorials skip.</p><p><strong>Transfer to real situations:</strong> understanding principles and counter-examples lets you apply solutions beyond the “ideal” example.</p><p><strong>Measurable progress:</strong> you clearly see trends and know exactly what to work on next.</p><p><strong>Metacognition:</strong> you learn <em>how to learn</em> - plan your reviews, self-check, and use documentation as a tool.</p><p><br></p><p>There are many effective ways to learn. A tutorial is a concrete guide for a specific flow, and it's great for seeing an end-to-end solution. However, relying on it alone can nudge learners into thinking there's only one path. </p><p>The <strong>practice-test format presented here</strong> builds <strong>nonlinear understanding;</strong> you learn what each piece means, when it does (or doesn't) work, and why.</p><p><strong>As you progress through the tests, you gain the whole - </strong>not just shortcuts<strong>.</strong> You see the map of topics, your blind spots, and the primary references. That’s the foundation of independence in real projects.</p><p><strong>Imagine the entire framework as a puzzle,</strong></p><p>In a tutorial, you watch how the instructor assembled <em>their</em> picture. <br>In this course, each topic is an individual puzzle piece.<br><strong>The result?</strong> Each of you will put together your <em>own</em> picture, tailored to the projects you actually work on.</p><p>If you’d like hands-on project walkthroughs too, standard tutorials are a great complement. <strong>I warmly recommend treating this practice-test course as essential reading first</strong> - <strong>it gives you the conceptual map that makes every subsequent tutorial clearer, faster, and more effective.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section Tests</strong> (formative, low-stakes)</p><p><strong><em>Database</em></strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Core</strong> connections, transactions, prepared statements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Migrations</strong> structure, columns/indexes/foreign keys, rollbacks, squashing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seeding</strong> seeders, factories, model states.</p></li><li><p><strong>Query Builder</strong> selects, joins, subqueries, aggregates, raw expressions (safe use), scopes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pagination</strong> simple vs length-aware, preserving query strings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Redis</strong> connections, pub/sub, pipelines, atomic ops, cache/queue use.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> solid fluency in bootstrapping, configuring, structuring, and deploying a clean Laravel 11 app.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Eloquent ORM</em></strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Essentials</strong> models, attributes, mass assignment, timestamps, casting (custom casts), soft deletes, global/local scopes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Relationships</strong> one-to-one/one-to-many/many-to-many, polymorphic, eager loading, constraints, pivots/syncing, touch.</p></li><li><p><strong>Factories</strong> model factories, states, sequences, relationships.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mutators/Accessors</strong> attribute objects vs classic syntax; cast interplay.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resources/Serialization</strong> API resources, conditional fields, collections, wrapping/JSON output.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collections</strong> EloquentCollection helpers, chunking/lazy.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> fluent data modeling with robust querying, serialization, and testable factories.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Digging Deeper</em></strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Queues &amp; Jobs</strong> workers/supervisors, retries/backoff, Horizon basics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Events</strong> listeners, queued listeners, subscribers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Broadcasting</strong> drivers, public/private/presence channels, auth, queues.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cache</strong> stores, tags, TTLs, atomic locks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Filesystem</strong> disks, visibility, streaming, S3.</p></li><li><p><strong>HTTP Client</strong> requests, retries, pools, fakes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scheduling</strong> tasks, overlap/mutex, maintenance windows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rate Limiting</strong> token/decay strategies, per-route/global.</p></li><li><p><strong>Concurrency/Processes</strong> chains, batches, throttling; external processes safely.</p></li><li><p><strong>Localization/Strings/Helpers/Collections/Context/Contracts/Packages</strong> practical utilities and extension points.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> mastery of the platform features that power background work, performance, and integration.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Testing</em></strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>HTTP Tests</strong> requests, JSON assertions, headers/cookies, auth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Browser (Dusk)</strong> selectors, actions, waiting, components, screenshots, CI runs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Database Testing</strong> migrations/transactions, refreshing, factories/seeders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mocking/Fakes</strong> events, bus, notifications, mail, storage, HTTP.</p></li><li><p><strong>Console Tests</strong> command I/O expectations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Testing Basics</strong> structure, environment, parallel testing, speed and isolation.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> confident, maintainable test suites across HTTP, browser, console, and data layers.</p><p><br></p><p>Each item includes a clear rationale and <strong>direct links to the relevant doc section</strong> (opens in a new tab).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Assessment model</strong><br>Finish each section with a timed, exam-mode practice test and compare your performance across attempts using Udemy’s Practice Test Insights.

  "description": "<p>Are you confident in Ruby, or has it ever surprised you with a tricky behavior you didn’t expect?</p><p>Welcome to Tricky Ruby Questions, a hands-on puzzle-based course designed to help you uncover and truly understand Ruby’s quirks, hidden features, and elegant design principles.</p><p><br></p><p>Ruby is a beautiful language — expressive, flexible, and powerful — but it also hides subtle behaviors that can surprise even experienced developers. This course transforms those hidden aspects into fun, interactive puzzles that help you think like a Rubyist and gain mastery through reasoning, not memorization.</p><p><br></p><p>You’ll explore concepts step-by-step, learning why Ruby behaves the way it does, not just what it does. Each section is built around real-world code examples, tricky snippets, and conceptual challenges that mirror what developers face in production or during technical interviews.</p><p><br></p><p>We’ll start with core foundations — variable scope, nil, and truthiness — before diving deeper into Ruby’s dynamic heart:</p><ul><li><p>Arrays, Hashes, and Enumerables — master data iteration and transformation</p></li><li><p>Methods, Blocks, and Closures — understand yields, procs, and lambdas clearly</p></li><li><p>Object Orientation — work with classes, inheritance, modules, and self</p></li><li><p>Metaprogramming — explore send, method_missing, and eval for dynamic code</p></li><li><p>Reflection and Constants — peek behind Ruby’s flexible internals</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>By the end, you’ll not only solve puzzles — you’ll think like Ruby itself.</p><p>You’ll understand how Ruby executes, how methods resolve, how objects communicate, and how dynamic behavior emerges elegantly from simple rules.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is ideal for Ruby and Rails developers, interview candidates, and curious programmers who want to deepen their understanding and sharpen their problem-solving skills with Ruby.</p><p><br></p><p>Get ready to code, think, and debug like a true Rubyist!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you preparing for your next Java Developer interview? Whether you are a fresher entering the field of software development or an experienced professional aiming for a senior role at top-tier technology companies, this comprehensive practice test course is designed to help you master every essential concept tested in real-world technical interviews.</p><p>With over <strong>1400 high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs)</strong>, detailed explanations, and realistic exam simulations, this course offers one of the most thorough preparations available on Udemy for Java-based technical assessments. Each question has been carefully developed to reflect actual interview patterns from leading IT firms, product-based organizations, and service companies.</p><p>This is not just a set of quizzes — it is a <strong>complete mock interview preparation system</strong> that helps you identify knowledge gaps, reinforce key concepts, and build confidence through repeated, structured practice.</p><p><strong>Why This Course?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Realistic Interview Simulation: Experience the format and difficulty level of actual coding rounds and technical screening exams.</p></li><li><p>Detailed Explanations: Every question includes a clear breakdown of why the correct answer is right and why the other options are incorrect.</p></li><li><p>Covers All Experience Levels: From basic syntax to advanced concurrency and enterprise frameworks — suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.</p></li><li><p>Topic-Wise Organization: Divided into six major sections so you can focus on specific areas where you need improvement.</p></li><li><p>Improve Speed and Accuracy: Develop faster decision-making skills under timed conditions with full-length and section-wise tests.</p></li><li><p>Lifetime Access: Revisit the material anytime to refresh your knowledge before interviews, promotions, or certification exams.</p></li></ul><p><strong>What You Will Learn</strong></p><p>Through extensive practice, you will gain deep proficiency across all core and advanced topics in Java development that are commonly evaluated during technical interviews. The course is organized into the following six comprehensive sections:</p><p><strong>Section 1: Core Java Fundamentals</strong></p><p>Build a strong foundation in Java programming with coverage of data types, variables, operators, control statements, arrays, strings, object-oriented programming (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism), abstraction, encapsulation, and exception handling.</p><p><strong>Section 2: Advanced Java Concepts</strong></p><p>Explore advanced language features including the Collections Framework, generics, multithreading, file input/output operations, serialization, annotations, enums, wrapper classes, autoboxing, memory management, garbage collection, and modern Java 8+ enhancements such as lambda expressions, Stream API, and functional interfaces.</p><p><strong>Section 3: Java Concurrency &amp; Multithreading</strong></p><p>Gain expertise in concurrent programming with topics such as thread lifecycle, synchronization techniques, inter-thread communication using wait/notify, thread pools and executors, concurrent collections (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap, BlockingQueue), atomic variables, the Fork/Join framework, CompletableFuture, and issues like deadlock, livelock, and visibility using volatile and synchronized keywords.</p><p><strong>Section 4: Java Design Patterns &amp; Best Practices</strong></p><p>Learn how to write clean, scalable, and maintainable code by mastering creational design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder), structural patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Proxy), behavioral patterns (Observer, Strategy, Command), SOLID principles, common anti-patterns, refactoring techniques, UML diagrams, unit testing with JUnit and Mockito, logging practices, and performance optimization strategies.</p><p><strong>Section 5: Java Frameworks &amp; Libraries</strong></p><p>Get hands-on with industry-standard frameworks and tools including Spring Framework (IoC, DI), Spring Boot (auto-configuration, starters), Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security (authentication, authorization, JWT), Hibernate ORM (session, transactions, caching), RESTful web services, Java Servlets and JSP, and widely used libraries such as Jackson, Lombok, Apache Commons, and SLF4J.</p><p><strong>Section 6: Java Tools, Build &amp; Deployment</strong></p><p>Understand the complete development lifecycle with topics on build automation using Maven and Gradle, version control with Git, continuous integration and deployment using Jenkins and GitHub Actions, IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse, JVM architecture (classloader, runtime data areas, JIT compilation), packaging formats (JAR, WAR), JDBC for database connectivity, and deployment environments including Docker, Kubernetes, Tomcat, and cloud platforms.</p><p><strong>Who Should Take This Course?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Computer science students preparing for campus recruitment</p></li><li><p>Entry-level developers seeking roles in Java backend development</p></li><li><p>Mid-level engineers planning to switch jobs or prepare for promotions</p></li><li><p>Senior developers aiming for system design or architectural positions</p></li><li><p>Anyone who wants to strengthen their Java knowledge and improve interview performance</p></li></ul><p>No prior interview experience is required. Whether you're starting from scratch or revisiting concepts after years in the industry, this course provides structured learning paths tailored to different skill levels.</p><p><strong>Sample Question with Explanation</strong></p><p><strong>Question:</strong><br>Which of the following statements about the String class in Java is true?</p><p>A) String objects are mutable and can be modified after creation<br>B) Strings created using double quotes are stored in the heap only<br>C) The == operator compares the content of two string objects<br>D) String uses constant pool memory to improve efficiency</p><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D) String uses constant pool memory to improve efficiency</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>In Java, the String class is immutable and utilizes the <strong>String Constant Pool</strong>, a special memory area within the heap (since Java 7), to store string literals. When a string is created using double quotes (\"hello\"), the JVM checks whether an identical string already exists in the pool. If it does, the existing reference is reused, improving memory efficiency.</p><p>Option A is incorrect because String objects are <strong>immutable</strong> — they cannot be altered once created.<br>Option B is false — strings created with double quotes are placed in the <strong>string constant pool</strong>, which is part of the heap but managed separately for reuse.<br>Option C is wrong — the == operator compares <strong>object references</strong>, not their contents; .equals() must be used to compare string values.</p><p>Therefore, the correct answer is <strong>D</strong>.</p><p><strong>Another Sample Question</strong></p><p><strong>Question:</strong><br>What is the primary difference between ArrayList and CopyOnWriteArrayList when iterating over them while modifying?</p><p>A) Both throw ConcurrentModificationException if modified during iteration<br>B) ArrayList allows modification during iteration while CopyOnWriteArrayList does not<br>C) ArrayList throws ConcurrentModificationException if structurally modified during iteration, whereas CopyOnWriteArrayList does not<br>D) There is no difference between the two</p><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C) ArrayList throws ConcurrentModificationException if structurally modified during iteration, whereas CopyOnWriteArrayList does not</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>ArrayList implements a <strong>fail-fast</strong> iterator. If the list is structurally modified (add, remove, clear) during iteration, except through the iterator’s own remove() method, it throws a ConcurrentModificationException.</p><p>In contrast, CopyOnWriteArrayList is a thread-safe list where every modification creates a new copy of the underlying array. Iterators operate on a snapshot of the list taken at the start of iteration. Therefore, they do not reflect modifications made after the iterator was created and never throw ConcurrentModificationException.</p><p>Hence, option C accurately describes this behavior.</p><p><strong>How This Course Helps You Succeed</strong></p><p>Modern technical interviews go beyond syntax — they assess conceptual clarity, practical application, and depth of understanding. This course prepares you to think critically, analyze options logically, and respond confidently under time pressure.</p><p>Each section includes:</p><ul><li><p>Timed practice tests to simulate real exam conditions</p></li><li><p>Randomized question sets to prevent rote memorization</p></li><li><p>Section-wise quizzes for targeted revision</p></li><li><p>Performance tracking and feedback</p></li><li><p>Review mode with instant access to explanations</p></li></ul><p>By completing this course, you will be able to:</p><ul><li><p>Confidently pass written tests and online coding assessments</p></li><li><p>Excel in telephonic and face-to-face technical interviews</p></li><li><p>Articulate answers clearly with accurate reasoning</p></li><li><p>Avoid common mistakes caused by misconceptions or incomplete knowledge</p></li></ul><p><strong>Join Thousands of Successful Learners</strong></p><p>Enroll now and take a decisive step toward securing your ideal Java Developer position at top companies such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, or innovative startups. With more than <strong>1400 expertly curated practice questions</strong> distributed across <strong>six in-depth sections</strong>, this course delivers the most comprehensive Java interview preparation resource on Udemy.</p><p>Do not rely on fragmented tutorials or outdated materials.

  "description": "<p>This comprehensive course provides a step-by-step introduction to building modern web applications using <strong>ASP.NET</strong> and <strong>Entity Framework</strong>. Under the guidance of <strong>Dr. Albert Sadowski</strong>, students will learn how to design, develop, and deploy fully functional web applications from scratch.</p><p>The course begins with a practical, hands-on project — creating a simple book list application. Through this project, learners will gain a foundational understanding of application architecture, data manipulation, and user interaction. Step by step, the course expands to cover key concepts such as <strong>controllers</strong>, <strong>endpoints</strong>, and <strong>HTTP requests</strong>, demonstrating how to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a clean and structured way.</p><p>In later modules, participants explore <strong>database integration</strong> using <strong>Entity Framework</strong>, learning how to define entities, manage database contexts, perform migrations, and seed data efficiently. The course also introduces <strong>service-oriented architecture</strong>, showing how to move business logic from controllers to dedicated service layers for better maintainability and scalability.</p><p>Students will further master essential topics such as <strong>Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)</strong>, <strong>AutoMapper</strong>, and <strong>data validation</strong> techniques to ensure smooth data exchange and application reliability. The final part of the course focuses on <strong>ASP.NET application configuration</strong>, covering Program.cs, middleware, environment settings, and configuration management through appsettings files.</p><p>By the end of this course, learners will have a solid foundation in web application development with ASP.NET, capable of building and managing professional-grade web solutions.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This hands-on course walks you step-by-step through building a complete, production-ready full-stack application with SvelteKit 5 in Runes Mode. You’ll master SvelteKit’s new RUNES reactivity, craft responsive navigation, and implement authentication with secure session management, hashed passwords, and a cookie-based login state. Along the way, you’ll apply practical patterns for organizing components, managing state with signals, and structuring features for long-term scalability and clarity.</p><p>On the data side, you’ll build end-to-end CRUD for Projects and Contacts backed by MongoDB, and you’ll write robust Netlify serverless functions for create, read, update, and delete operations. Security is a first-class theme: you’ll add CAPTCHA/anti-bot checks, email verification, rate limiting, and route protection so your app resists common abuse vectors and stays stable under load.</p><p>You’ll also polish the user experience with responsive layouts, conditional rendering, and reusable form components designed for maintainability. A real-world feature, EzFlip, ties it all together—a property analysis tool that calculates Maximum Allowable Offer (MAYO) and integrates with your project data, giving you tangible, job-ready experience.</p><p>Finally, you’ll deploy to Netlify, configure environment variables, and verify everything in a live environment. By the end, you’ll have a secure, professional-grade SvelteKit 5 app—and the confidence to design, build, secure, and deploy full-stack applications on your own.</p><p>AI Disclosure: for the purpose of voice clarity, the voice has been enhanced using artificial intelligence software.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Tired of “hello world” tutorials? We’re building a real fintech app, end-to-end, with Django (DRF) and React. By the time you’re done, you’ll have a working banking-style project with JWT auth, KYC, Stripe funding, wallets, transfers, savings goals, transactions, dashboards, and notifications. Not theory. Shippable code.</p><p><br></p><p>We start fast: spin up React + Django, wire JWT with refresh tokens, lock down protected routes, and ship clean login/register flows. Then we get practical with compliance-style KYC: models, serializers, file uploads, and a React workflow to submit and review data.</p><p><br></p><p>Next, the money layer: wallets, transactions, funding, deposits, withdrawals, modeled cleanly in DRF with serializers you won’t be embarrassed to maintain. We integrate Stripe in test mode, handle web-ish edge cases, and surface clear errors and toasts on the frontend. </p><p>Transfers and beneficiaries? You’ll build the APIs and the React UX: searchable lists, quick actions, optimistic updates, and loading states that don’t feel janky.</p><p>You’ll create savings goals with real progress, plus a dashboard that actually tells a story: balances, recent activity, and transaction drill-downs. We also add in-app notifications so users know what just happened and why.</p><p>Throughout, we keep the stack modern and sane: environment variables, API clients, modular React components, and readable DRF views/serializers. </p><p>You’ll test endpoints with Postman and wire everything into React without spaghetti.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want a portfolio project that looks like a product (not a tutorial), this is it. You’ll leave with a repo you can demo, extend, or take to production with minimal rework.</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course, you will learn how to build and secure modern REST APIs with Java 25, Spring Boot 4, Spring Security 7, JWT, Spring Data JPA with Hibernate 7, and MySQL.</p><p><strong>This is a brand-new course built using the latest versions of Java 25, Spring Boot 4, and Spring Security 7.</strong></p><p>The entire course is designed for beginners and intermediate developers who want practical, real-world experience. Every concept is explained clearly, and every feature is demonstrated through hands-on projects.</p><p>We begin by understanding the foundations of REST. You will learn what REST APIs are, how they work, how clients communicate with servers, and what makes a good API design. We cover important topics such as resources, endpoints, HTTP methods, status codes, and best practices used in real applications. This gives you a strong base before writing any code.</p><p>After building this foundation, we move into real Spring Boot development. You will create a Spring Boot 4 project, explore the folder structure, and understand how Spring Boot manages configuration and dependencies. From there, we start building REST APIs step by step by creating controllers, services, repositories, and models. This helps you understand how real backend applications are structured.</p><p>Next, we connect our APIs to a MySQL database and build complete CRUD operations. Through a Task Management project, you will learn how to store, update, retrieve, and delete data using Spring Data JPA. You will also learn how to write clean code, validate input, and handle exceptions so your API always returns clear and consistent responses.</p><p>Once you are comfortable with CRUD, we move to more advanced backend design. You will build REST APIs for a One-To-Many relationship using a User–Blog mini-project. This helps you understand entity mapping, cascading, lazy loading, and designing APIs that work with relational data.</p><p>To make your learning more practical, the course includes a complete Banking Application. In this section, you will build features such as creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, transferring funds, and generating transaction history. You will learn how to design business logic, validate data, and build reusable service methods.</p><p>After mastering API development, we move into Spring Security 7. This is one of the most important skills for backend developers. You will learn how authentication and authorization work, how Spring Security processes requests, and how to secure API endpoints. We configure database-backed user authentication, encrypted passwords, and role-based access control.</p><p>Then we build Login and Register REST APIs using the modern Spring Security configuration approach. This gives you real experience in creating user accounts, validating credentials, and protecting routes based on roles.</p><p>The course ends with a complete JWT (JSON Web Token) implementation. You will learn how JWT works, why modern applications use it, and how to integrate it with Spring Security 7. You will create access and refresh tokens, validate requests, secure API routes, and return meaningful error responses.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will know how to:</p><p><strong>• Build REST APIs using Spring Boot 4<br>• Structure real backend applications<br>• Work with MySQL and Spring Data JPA<br>• Build CRUD and relationship-based APIs<br>• Develop a complete Banking System<br>• Implement Spring Security 7 authentication<br>• Build Login and Register APIs<br>• Secure applications with JWT tokens</strong></p><p>This course gives you practical skills, real-world projects, and modern Spring techniques that you can start using immediately in your job or personal projects.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you preparing for your next Mobile App Developer interview? Whether you're a fresher stepping into the world of mobile development or an experienced engineer aiming for a senior role, this comprehensive practice test course is designed to help you master the technical and conceptual knowledge required to succeed in real-world interviews.</p><p>This <strong>1,500-question practice exam</strong> covers every major area of mobile application development, structured into <strong>six in-depth sections</strong>, each focusing on key domains that top tech companies and startups evaluate during hiring. Every question is crafted in <strong>multiple-choice format (MCQ)</strong> with <strong>detailed explanations</strong> for both correct and incorrect answers — helping you not only memorize but truly understand the underlying concepts.</p><p>With this course, you'll:</p><ul><li><p>Simulate real interview conditions with timed quizzes</p></li><li><p>Identify knowledge gaps and strengthen weak areas</p></li><li><p>Gain confidence through repeated practice</p></li><li><p>Learn how to approach tricky scenario-based questions</p></li><li><p>Brush up core concepts before job interviews, coding rounds, or certification exams</p></li></ul><p>Each section has been carefully curated based on industry standards, job descriptions, and actual interview experiences from Android, iOS, and cross-platform developers.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Get in This Course</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,500 High-Quality MCQs across 6 Core Sections<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Realistic Interview-Level Difficulty (Beginner to Advanced)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Correct Answer Highlighted with In-Depth Explanations<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Instant Feedback After Each Question<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Learn by Understanding – Not Just Memorizing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ideal for Job Seekers, Freelancers, and Career Switchers</p><p><strong>Full Coverage: 6 Key Sections Included</strong></p><p><strong>Section 1: Mobile App Development Fundamentals</strong></p><p>Build a strong foundation with essential topics like native vs hybrid apps, app architecture patterns (MVC, MVP, MVVM), UI/UX design principles, version control systems, deployment workflows, monetization models, and best practices in agile environments.</p><p><strong>Section 2: Android Development Concepts</strong></p><p>Master core Android components including Activities, Services, BroadcastReceivers, and ContentProviders. Dive deep into lifecycles, intents, RecyclerView, Room Database, Retrofit, permissions, background processing, Jetpack libraries, and performance optimization techniques.</p><p><strong>Section 3: iOS Development Concepts</strong></p><p>Test your knowledge of Swift programming, UIKit vs SwiftUI, view controllers, Auto Layout, Core Data, UserDefaults, URLSession, delegates and protocols, memory management using ARC, push notifications, and App Store submission guidelines.</p><p><strong>Section 4: Cross-Platform Frameworks (Flutter, React Native, Xamarin)</strong></p><p>Evaluate your expertise in modern cross-platform tools. Explore Flutter widgets, Dart language, React Native components, state management solutions (BLoC, Provider, Redux), navigation, native integrations, hot reload mechanics, third-party plugins, and publishing multi-platform apps.</p><p><strong>Section 5: APIs, Networking &amp; Backend Integration</strong></p><p>Understand how mobile apps communicate with servers. Cover RESTful APIs, GraphQL, authentication methods (JWT, OAuth), HTTP methods and status codes, JSON/XML parsing, error handling, caching strategies, WebSockets for real-time data, and integration with BaaS platforms like Firebase and Supabase.</p><p><strong>Section 6: Advanced Topics &amp; Best Practices</strong></p><p>Go beyond basics with advanced subjects such as mobile security (OWASP risks, SSL pinning), code quality, unit and UI testing, CI/CD pipelines (Fastlane, GitHub Actions), modularization, internationalization, offline support, accessibility features, crash reporting tools, and emerging trends like AI-powered apps and foldable device compatibility. Includes behavioral and situational questions to prepare for soft-skill assessments.</p><p><strong>Sample Practice Question (with Explanation)</strong></p><p><strong>Question:</strong><br>Which of the following is NOT a valid Android component?</p><p>A) Activity<br>B) Service<br>C) ViewController<br>D) BroadcastReceiver</p><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C) ViewController</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>\"ViewController\" is not an Android component; it is part of the iOS framework used in UIKit for managing views. In Android, the equivalent concept is handled by \"Activity\" or \"Fragment\". The other options — Activity, Service, and BroadcastReceiver — are all fundamental building blocks of Android applications defined in the Android SDK. Knowing platform-specific terminology is crucial when working across ecosystems or attending interviews that assess cross-platform awareness.</p><p><strong>Another Sample Question:</strong></p><p><strong>Question:</strong><br>In Flutter, what is the main difference between StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget?</p><p>A) StatelessWidget can maintain internal state while StatefulWidget cannot<br>B) StatefulWidget rebuilds automatically when external data changes, but StatelessWidget does not<br>C) StatefulWidget allows mutable state that triggers UI updates when changed, whereas StatelessWidget depends only on input parameters<br>D) Only StatefulWidget can accept props from parent widgets</p><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C) StatefulWidget allows mutable state that triggers UI updates when changed, whereas StatelessWidget depends only on input parameters</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>StatefulWidget has a separate State object where mutable data (state) is stored. When setState() is called, the framework triggers a rebuild of the widget tree. On the other hand, StatelessWidget does not hold any mutable state — its appearance is determined solely by its constructor arguments (props). This distinction is foundational in understanding Flutter’s reactive UI model.</p><p><strong>Who Is This Course For?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Aspiring mobile developers preparing for entry-level roles</p></li><li><p>Intermediate to senior developers brushing up before technical interviews</p></li><li><p>Computer science students seeking hands-on interview prep</p></li><li><p>Professionals transitioning from web to mobile development</p></li><li><p>Anyone wanting to validate their knowledge with realistic practice tests</p></li></ul><p>No prior preparation needed — just start practicing and improve your speed, accuracy, and confidence.</p><p><strong>Why Take This Course?</strong></p><p>Interviews today go beyond syntax. Employers look for problem-solving ability, architectural understanding, debugging insight, and familiarity with modern tools. This course doesn’t just teach you <em>what</em> to answer — it explains <em>why</em> one choice is better than another, giving you deep conceptual clarity that lasts beyond the interview room.</p><p>By the end of this course, you'll be fully equipped to tackle technical screenings, coding challenges, system design discussions, and even lead developer roles with confidence.</p><p>Start practicing now — because your dream job in mobile development starts with the right preparation.</p><p>Enroll today and take one step closer to landing your next Mobile App Developer position!</p>",

  "description": "<p><em>This course contains the use of artificial intelligence.</em></p><p>In today's digital landscape, building applications that \"just work\" isn't enough. Security breaches cost companies millions and destroy user trust overnight. This comprehensive course transforms you from a developer who writes working code into a security-conscious professional who builds hack-proof applications from the ground up.</p><p>Secure Python &amp; Django Development is your complete roadmap to mastering security best practices in web application development. Whether you're building your first Django project or securing existing enterprise applications, this course provides the critical knowledge and practical skills to protect your applications against modern cyber threats.</p><p>You'll start with fundamental security principles—understanding the mindset of attackers, learning threat modeling, and adopting secure coding habits that become second nature. Then dive deep into Python-specific security, covering safe password storage, secure dependency management, input validation, and automated vulnerability scanning with industry-standard tools like Bandit and Safety.</p><p>The Django-focused modules reveal how to leverage Django's powerful built-in security features while avoiding common pitfalls. Master CSRF protection, secure session management, SQL injection prevention, XSS mitigation, and proper authentication implementation. Learn to configure Django settings for production environments, implement content security policies, and handle file uploads without creating vulnerabilities.</p><p>Move beyond basic security into advanced deployment hardening—configuring HTTPS with proper SSL/TLS, implementing security headers, setting up WAF (Web Application Firewall), working with Docker for container security, and managing secrets with tools like HashiCorp Vault and AWS Secrets Manager. You'll build a complete secure REST API with Django REST Framework, implementing multi-layered authentication, rate limiting, and comprehensive security testing.</p><p>Discover AI-powered security testing tools that scan your codebase for vulnerabilities, learn incident response procedures for when attacks occur, and understand compliance requirements like GDPR and HIPAA. Real-world case studies of major Django security failures ensure you learn from others' costly mistakes rather than making them yourself.</p><p>By the end of this course, you'll have built secure applications from scratch, implemented defense-in-depth strategies, automated security testing into your CI/CD pipeline, and developed the security mindset that separates professional developers from amateur coders. You'll possess a complete secure To-Do API project demonstrating industry best practices and a security-first portfolio that impresses employers.</p><p>Security isn't optional—it's your responsibility as a developer. This course gives you everything needed to meet that responsibility with confidence and competence.</p><p><br></p>",

Our core philosophy is <strong>Just-in-Time Learning</strong>: you'll learn precisely what you need, right when you need it, and apply it immediately.</p><p><strong>How We Learn (The \"Senior Dev\" Method):</strong></p><p>This course is <strong>not </strong>about blindly copy-pasting code from an AI. We will use an LLM (like Gemini) as a powerful learning tool, mirroring the workflow of a senior developer:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Define the Goal:</strong> We'll break down a feature into a clear requirement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Draft with AI:</strong> We'll craft a precise prompt to have an AI generate the first draft of our code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Analyze &amp; Understand:</strong> This is the most critical step. We will go line-by-line through the AI-generated code to understand the \"what\" and the \"why\".</p></li><li><p><strong>Refine &amp; Refactor:</strong> You will then take the lead—fixing bugs, making improvements, and integrating the code perfectly, just like a senior engineer would.</p></li></ol><p>By the end of this course, you will not only have an incredible project for your portfolio but, more importantly, the confidence and skill to bring any of your own ideas to life.</p><p><strong>Who This Course Is For</strong></p><p>This course is designed for a wide range of learners, and we've built a specific path for you, no matter your skill level.</p><ul><li><p><strong>For Absolute Beginners (with Zero Coding Experience):</strong> If you're new to coding, this is the perfect place to start. Our dedicated <strong>\"Foundations\"</strong> module will gently guide you through the essentials of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, giving you the solid groundwork needed to tackle the main project with confidence. You don't need any prior experience—just a desire to build!</p></li><li><p><strong>For Experienced Developers:</strong> If you're already a developer, this course will level up your skills. You will learn how to integrate a cutting-edge, AI-accelerated workflow and master the latest features of the modern web stack, including React 19, Next.js 15 Server Components, and advanced database management with Prisma.</p></li><li><p><strong>For All Learners:</strong> This course is perfect for anyone tired of fragmented tutorials who wants to build a single, comprehensive portfolio project and learn a practical, momentum-driven approach to development.</p></li></ul><p><strong>What You'll Learn</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Adopt a Modern AI-Accelerated Workflow:</strong> Learn to use AI as a co-pilot to write code faster and more effectively.</p></li><li><p><strong>Master a Full-Stack, In-Demand Tech Stack:</strong> Build expertise in Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Prisma, NextAuth v5, Zod, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build a Complete, Real-World Application:</strong> Create a full-featured hospital appointment and admin management system (\"Highland Hospital\") from scratch.</p></li><li><p><strong>Develop Production-Ready Features:</strong> Implement critical features like secure authentication, patient profile management, appointment scheduling, payment processing with PayPal, and file uploads.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build a Comprehensive Admin Dashboard:</strong> Create a secure, role-based admin system to manage doctors, appointments, users, and site content.</p></li><li><p><strong>Master Modern Next.js Features:</strong> Work with React Server Components, Server Actions, and advanced file-based routing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Think Like a Builder:</strong> Develop the momentum and problem-solving skills to overcome challenges and complete complex projects.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Technologies </strong></p><p>This course is a comprehensive deep-dive into the modern web development ecosystem.

  "description": "<p>Prepare for your next Machine Learning Engineer interview with confidence. This comprehensive practice test course delivers <strong>1,400+ meticulously crafted multiple-choice questions (MCQs)</strong> designed to simulate real-world technical interviews at top tech companies, AI startups, and enterprise organizations. Whether you’re a fresher building foundational knowledge or an experienced engineer targeting senior roles, this course bridges critical gaps in your preparation through <strong>detailed explanations, industry-aligned scenarios, and structured topic coverage</strong>.</p><p>Unlike generic question banks, every MCQ includes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step-by-step reasoning</strong> for correct answers</p></li><li><p><strong>Clear breakdowns</strong> of why incorrect options are misleading</p></li><li><p><strong>Real-world context</strong> (e.g., production deployment challenges, ethical trade-offs)</p></li><li><p><strong>References to core concepts</strong> (mathematics, frameworks, system design)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why This Course Stands Out</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Complete Interview Simulation</strong><br>Cover every stage of the ML interview process—from algorithmic puzzles and coding challenges to system design whiteboarding and behavioral case studies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Zero Fluff, Pure Technical Depth</strong><br>Questions are derived from actual interviews at FAANG, AI labs, and Fortune 500 companies, focusing on <em>what you’ll actually be asked</em>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Learn While You Test</strong><br>Each explanation transforms a practice question into a mini-lesson, reinforcing concepts you’ll apply on the job.</p></li><li><p><strong>Structured for Progressive Mastery</strong><br>Organized into <strong>6 critical sections</strong> (detailed below), ensuring no topic is overlooked.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Full Course Coverage: 6 Core Sections</strong></p><p>Your preparation spans the entire ML engineering lifecycle:</p><p><strong>1. Core Machine Learning Concepts</strong><br>Supervised/Unsupervised/Reinforcement Learning Algorithms | Model Evaluation &amp; Optimization | ML Theory &amp; Mathematics | Ethics &amp; AI Governance</p><p><strong>2. Machine Learning Engineer Role &amp; Responsibilities</strong><br>Role Overview &amp; Workflow | Infrastructure &amp; Data Pipelines | Deployment &amp; Production | Collaboration &amp; Soft Skills</p><p><strong>3. Programming &amp; Tools</strong><br>Python for ML | ML Frameworks | Data Handling &amp; Visualization | Big Data Tools</p><p><strong>4. Data Management &amp; Processing</strong><br>Data Preprocessing | Data Pipelines | Databases &amp; Storage | Data Visualization &amp; Reporting</p><p><strong>5. Advanced Topics &amp; Specializations</strong><br>Deep Learning | NLP &amp; Computer Vision | Reinforcement Learning | Domain-Specific ML</p><p><strong>6. Interview Preparation &amp; Case Studies</strong><br>Case Study Analysis | System Design | Behavioral &amp; Situational Scenarios | Mock Interview Practice</p><p><strong>Sample Questions with Detailed Explanations</strong></p><p><em>Experience the depth of our explanations:</em></p><p><strong>Question:</strong><br><em>In a classification problem with severe class imbalance (1% positive samples), which evaluation metric is MOST appropriate?</em><br>A) Accuracy<br>B) Precision<br>C) F1-Score<br>D) ROC-AUC</p><p><strong>Correct Answer: C) F1-Score</strong><br><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>Accuracy (A) is misleading here—predicting all negatives would yield 99% accuracy despite zero predictive power. Precision (B) alone ignores false negatives, critical in high-stakes domains (e.g., medical diagnosis). ROC-AUC (D) can be overly optimistic when negative samples dominate. F1-Score (C) balances precision and recall, prioritizing detection of the rare positive class. This is industry best practice for imbalanced data (e.g., fraud detection), as confirmed by Google’s <em>Machine Learning Crash Course</em> and scikit-learn documentation.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong><br><em>When deploying a real-time recommendation model, sudden latency spikes occur during peak traffic. Which solution is MOST cost-effective for immediate mitigation?</em><br>A) Rewrite the model in C++<br>B) Implement request batching<br>C) Double the server instances<br>D) Switch to a simpler model architecture</p><p><strong>Correct Answer: B) Implement request batching</strong><br><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>Doubling servers (C) incurs unnecessary long-term costs. Rewriting in C++ (A) requires weeks of engineering effort. Switching models (D) sacrifices accuracy without addressing the root cause. Request batching (B) groups multiple inference requests into a single computation, reducing GPU/CPU overhead per prediction. This is a standard MLOps technique used at Netflix and Amazon (per AWS SageMaker best practices) to handle traffic surges with minimal latency impact.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong><br><em>During a system design interview, you’re asked to build a fraud detection pipeline. Which component is CRITICAL for maintaining model relevance over time?</em><br>A) High-precision training data<br>B) Real-time model retraining triggers<br>C) Complex deep learning architecture<br>D) Cloud-based data storage</p><p><strong>Correct Answer: B) Real-time model retraining triggers</strong><br><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>Fraud patterns evolve rapidly (e.g., new scam tactics). Static models degrade within days. While high-quality data (A) and cloud storage (D) are foundational, they don’t address concept drift. Complex architectures (C) increase maintenance overhead. Real-time retraining—triggered by statistical anomalies in prediction distributions (e.g., sudden drop in precision)—ensures continuous adaptation. This approach is mandated in PayPal’s and Stripe’s production pipelines, as documented in IEEE ML engineering case studies.</p><p><strong>Who Should Enroll?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Job Seekers</strong>: Land ML engineer roles at FAANG, AI startups, or data-driven enterprises.</p></li><li><p><strong>Career Switchers</strong>: Transition from data science/software engineering with targeted technical practice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Experienced Engineers</strong>: Refresh knowledge for senior/lead interviews (system design, scalability).</p></li><li><p><strong>Students</strong>: Build interview stamina before campus placements or internships.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Your Preparation Advantage</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>1,400+ Questions</strong>: Rigorous coverage across all 6 sections (230+ per section).</p></li><li><p><strong>Time-Efficient Learning</strong>: Filter questions by difficulty (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) or topic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Exam Simulator Mode</strong>: Timed tests mimicking Google/Meta interview pressure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lifetime Access</strong>: New questions added quarterly based on trending interview topics.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Stop memorizing fragmented concepts.

  "description": "<p>This first volume focuses on the essentials of the Laravel framework - setup, configuration, core primitives, and architecture. </p><p><strong>How you’ll learn</strong><br>This course is built around interactive MCQ practice tests 100% aligned to the official documentation. Instead of reading end-to-end, you’ll diagnose gaps, focus on essentials, and jump straight to the right doc page after each question. Explanations are elaborative (not just right/wrong) and include why other options are wrong.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The goal is for you to learn actively, quickly close knowledge gaps, and develop the habit of relying on primary sources.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Benefits of this approach</strong></p><p><strong>Active recall:</strong> you’re not reading passively - you think and check yourself actively, which makes knowledge stick.</p><p><strong>Smart feedback:</strong> you don’t just get “correct/incorrect”; you understand <em>why</em> and <em>where</em> you were wrong (it closes gaps immediately).</p><p><strong>Habituating documentation use:</strong> I point you straight to the relevant passages in the official docs - you build the habit of checking the source of truth.</p><p><strong>On-the-fly diagnostics:</strong> every answer maps your strengths/weaknesses by section - you study <em>exactly where it hurts</em>.</p><p><strong>Learning from mistakes:</strong> the moment you realize <em>why</em> something is wrong is the moment you remember it most deeply.</p><p><strong>Broad coverage:</strong> question by question, we cover the “edges” and special cases most tutorials skip.</p><p><strong>Transfer to real situations:</strong> understanding principles and counter-examples lets you apply solutions beyond the “ideal” example.</p><p><strong>Measurable progress:</strong> you clearly see trends and know exactly what to work on next.</p><p><strong>Metacognition:</strong> you learn <em>how to learn</em> - plan your reviews, self-check, and use documentation as a tool.</p><p><br></p><p>There are many effective ways to learn. A tutorial is a concrete guide for a specific flow, and it's great for seeing an end-to-end solution. However, relying on it alone can nudge learners into thinking there's only one path. </p><p>The <strong>practice-test format presented here</strong> builds <strong>nonlinear understanding;</strong> you learn what each piece means, when it does (or doesn't) work, and why.</p><p><strong>As you progress through the tests, you gain the whole - </strong>not just shortcuts<strong>.</strong> You see the map of topics, your blind spots, and the primary references. That’s the foundation of independence in real projects.</p><p><strong>Imagine the entire framework as a puzzle,</strong></p><p>In a tutorial, you watch how the instructor assembled <em>their</em> picture. <br>In this course, each topic is an individual puzzle piece.<br><strong>The result?</strong> Each of you will put together your <em>own</em> picture, tailored to the projects you actually work on.</p><p>If you’d like hands-on project walkthroughs too, standard tutorials are a great complement. <strong>I warmly recommend treating this practice-test course as essential reading first</strong> - <strong>it gives you the conceptual map that makes every subsequent tutorial clearer, faster, and more effective.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section Tests</strong> (formative, low-stakes)</p><p><strong><em>Getting Started</em></strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Installation </strong>Composer create-project vs Laravel Installer, project skeleton, php artisan serve, Sail bootstrap, env setup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Configuration </strong>.env &amp;

  "description": "<p>Learn how to design and build realistic Industry 4.0 dashboards that simulate smart manufacturing environments — entirely in the browser. In this project-based course, you’ll use <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> to create live, data-driven dashboards that look and feel like real industrial control systems.</p><p>We’ll start by setting up the structure of a smart factory interface, complete with production lines, efficiency metrics, energy monitoring, and animated data updates. You’ll see how to create glass-style layouts, apply responsive grids, and simulate dynamic system behavior — all without connecting to a backend or AI model. Every movement, color change, and blinking indicator will have a functional purpose, just like in real production monitoring systems.</p><p>This is not a coding-from-zero course. It’s for learners who already understand basic web development and want to apply those skills to <strong>industrial visualization, manufacturing design, or digital twin simulation</strong> projects. You’ll focus on turning code into something visually meaningful and interactive.</p><p>By the end of the course, you’ll have a professional, browser-based <strong>Smart Factory Dashboard</strong> that you can present to clients, integrate into an IoT project, or use as part of your Industry 4.0 portfolio. No AI, no data science — just clear front-end logic, thoughtful design, and powerful simulation.</p>",

  "description": "<p>A warm welcome to the <strong>FastAPI – Modern Python Backend and API Development</strong> course by <strong>Uplatz</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is FastAPI?</strong></p><p><strong>FastAPI </strong>is a <strong>modern, high-performance web framework</strong> for building <strong>APIs with Python 3.7+</strong>, based on <strong>standard Python type hints</strong>. FastAPI is one of the fastest-growing web frameworks in the Python ecosystem. Known for its <strong>speed, simplicity, and production readiness</strong>, FastAPI makes it easier than ever to build scalable and high-performance RESTful APIs.</p><p>It is designed to be:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fast</strong> → Built on <strong>Starlette</strong> (for web handling) and <strong>Pydantic</strong> (for data validation), making it one of the fastest Python frameworks available.</p></li><li><p><strong>Easy to use</strong> → Its declarative style with type hints makes APIs quick to develop and maintain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data validation ready</strong> → Every request and response can be automatically validated against Pydantic models.</p></li><li><p><strong>Production-ready</strong> → Includes built-in support for async, OpenAPI documentation, and OAuth2/JWT security.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>How FastAPI Works</strong></p><p>At its core, FastAPI integrates:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Starlette</strong> → Handles HTTP requests, routing, and background tasks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pydantic</strong> → Handles serialization, deserialization, and validation of request/response data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Python type hints</strong> → Used to automatically generate request validation rules and API documentation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Automatic docs</strong> → Built-in OpenAPI and Swagger UI docs are generated without extra configuration.</p></li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>Real-World Applications Built with FastAPI</strong></p><p>FastAPI is used by startups and enterprises alike because of its <strong>speed, scalability, and simplicity</strong>.

  "description": "<p><strong>|| Unofficial Course ||</strong></p><p>This course provides a complete and structured learning journey into <strong>SAPUI5</strong>, the core front-end framework behind SAP Fiori applications. It is designed to help learners understand not just <em>how</em> to develop with SAPUI5, but <em>why</em> the framework works the way it does. </p><p>Starting from fundamentals, you will explore the evolution of <strong>SAPUI5 and OpenUI5</strong>, its relationship with Fiori, and how it fits into the modern SAP technology stack. The course gradually builds your understanding of the framework’s architecture, MVC design pattern, controls, and data binding concepts, enabling you to think like a UI5 developer.</p><p>You will learn how <strong>SAPUI5 applications are bootstrapped</strong>, how views and controllers communicate, and how reusable components like fragments improve modularity. A strong emphasis is placed on models and data handling, especially OData services, which form the backbone of enterprise SAP applications. The course explains how SAPUI5 consumes data, loads metadata, and binds it intelligently to UI controls, giving you a clear conceptual foundation to work with real-world business applications.</p><p>As you progress, you will gain clarity on how <strong>SAPUI5 controls</strong> are structured and how layout and data display controls are used to create responsive, user-friendly interfaces. You will also learn about the application lifecycle, from initialization to deployment, and understand how SAPUI5 applications are packaged and transported to SAP Fiori Launchpad or other environments. </p><p>Instead of jumping directly into coding, this course ensures that you develop a strong architectural and conceptual understanding, so you can build SAPUI5 applications confidently and professionally.</p><p>Whether you are new to UI development or transitioning from ABAP or SAP functional roles into SAP front-end development, this course will equip you with the foundational knowledge needed to design, structure, and deploy SAPUI5 apps that follow SAP best practices. </p><p>By the end of the course, you will have a clear <strong>understanding of how SAPUI5 works</strong> under the hood and how it enables Fiori-style enterprise solutions, preparing you for more advanced development topics and real-world implementation scenarios.</p><p>Thank you</p>",

  "description": "<p>A warm welcome to <strong>Flask for Python Devs: Build Real-World Web Apps &amp; REST APIs </strong>course by <strong>Uplatz</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is Flask?</strong></p><p><strong>Flask</strong> is a lightweight (“micro”) <strong>Python web framework</strong> for building web applications and APIs. “Micro” means its <strong>core is small and simple</strong>, HTTP handling, routing, templating, and a few utilities, while everything else (DB, auth, forms, migrations, etc.) is added via <strong>extensions</strong>.</p><p><br>Under the hood it relies on:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Werkzeug</strong> – WSGI utilities (request/response, routing, server)</p></li><li><p><strong>Jinja2</strong> – HTML templating engine</p></li></ul><p>Because it’s minimal and modular, Flask is popular for prototypes, microservices, REST APIs, and production apps where you want flexibility over batteries-included.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What does Flask do?</strong></p><p>Out of the box, Flask provides:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Routing</strong>: Map URLs to Python functions (“views”).</p></li><li><p><strong>Request/Response objects</strong>: Access headers, query params, form data, files, JSON.</p></li><li><p><strong>Templating</strong>: Render HTML with <strong>Jinja2</strong> (control flow, filters, auto-escaping).</p></li><li><p><strong>Sessions &amp; Cookies</strong>: Signed, cookie-based session storage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Static files</strong>: Serve assets during development.</p></li><li><p><strong>Error handling &amp; hooks</strong>: @app.errorhandler, before_request, after_request, teardown_request.</p></li><li><p><strong>CLI &amp; Dev server</strong>: flask run, debug reloader, interactive debugger.</p></li></ul><p>Through extensions you commonly add:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Database/ORM</strong>: Flask-SQLAlchemy migrations with Flask-Migrate (Alembic).</p></li><li><p><strong>Forms &amp; CSRF</strong>: Flask-WTF (WTForms + CSRF protection).</p></li><li><p><strong>Auth</strong>: Flask-Login (sessions), Flask-JWT-Extended (tokens).</p></li><li><p><strong>Caching/Queues</strong>: Flask-Caching, background tasks with <strong>Celery</strong>/RQ.</p></li><li><p><strong>Schema validation</strong>: Marshmallow/Pydantic (for APIs).</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>How does Flask work?</strong></p><p>At a high level, a web request flows like this:</p><ol><li><p><strong>WSGI server</strong> (e.g., Gunicorn/uWSGI/Waitress) receives HTTP request.</p></li><li><p>The server calls your Flask <strong>application callable</strong> (app), passing WSGI environ.</p></li><li><p>Flask creates <strong>application</strong> and <strong>request contexts</strong>, exposing request, session, g, current_app.</p></li><li><p><strong>Routing</strong> matches the URL &amp; method to a <strong>view function</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Your view runs business logic, talks to DB/services, and returns a <strong>Response</strong> (HTML/JSON/redirect).</p></li><li><p><strong>After-request hooks</strong> run; response goes back through WSGI server to the client.</p></li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>Key pieces:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Blueprints</strong>: Package routes/templates into reusable modules, then register on the app.</p></li><li><p><strong>App factory pattern</strong>: Create the app in a function (create_app(config)), making testing/config easier.</p></li><li><p><strong>Contexts</strong>: Temporary objects tying a request to globals (request, session, g).</p></li><li><p><strong>Middleware</strong>: WSGI middlewares can wrap the app for cross-cutting concerns (logging, auth gates, etc.).</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Course Description</strong></p><p><strong>Become a Flask Expert and Build Real-World Web Applications with Python</strong></p><p>Flask is one of the most powerful yet lightweight web frameworks in the Python ecosystem.<br>This hands-on course takes you from the fundamentals of Flask to advanced concepts such as authentication, REST API development, and production deployment.</p><p>Through practical, project-driven learning, you’ll master how to design and build robust web applications and APIs using Flask, Jinja2, and SQLAlchemy<br>You will also learn to manage sessions, handle forms, integrate databases, implement authentication, and deploy Flask apps on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Docker.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will have built over 10 real-world projects, including a Blog App, E-Commerce Website, Chat Application, Weather App, and more—each reinforcing key concepts with hands-on practice.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What You’ll Learn</strong></p><ul><li><p>Understand the core architecture and workflow of Flask</p></li><li><p>Build dynamic and data-driven web applications using Jinja2 templates</p></li><li><p>Handle user input, forms, and data validation efficiently</p></li><li><p>Integrate and manage databases with Flask-SQLAlchemy</p></li><li><p>Develop RESTful APIs to power web and mobile applications</p></li><li><p>Implement authentication, authorization, sessions, and cookies</p></li><li><p>Schedule background tasks using Celery</p></li><li><p>Configure logging, error handling, and app settings for production</p></li><li><p>Deploy Flask apps using Docker, Heroku, or AWS</p></li><li><p>Build 10+ real-world Flask projects and prepare for developer interviews</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Projects You’ll Build</strong></p><ol><li><p>To-Do List App</p></li><li><p>Blog Website</p></li><li><p>Weather Application</p></li><li><p>URL Shortener</p></li><li><p>Simple E-Commerce Platform</p></li><li><p>Personal Portfolio Website</p></li><li><p>Real-Time Chat Application</p></li><li><p>Habit Tracker</p></li><li><p>Simple Polling App</p></li><li><p>Task Management API</p></li></ol><p>Each project is designed to apply the skills learned in earlier modules and demonstrate how Flask can be used in real development environments.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who This Course Is For</strong></p><ul><li><p>Python developers looking to enter web development</p></li><li><p>Backend or full-stack beginners who prefer hands-on learning</p></li><li><p>Software engineers interested in RESTful API and microservice development</p></li><li><p>Data scientists wanting to serve models via Flask APIs</p></li><li><p>Freelancers and entrepreneurs aiming to build and deploy web apps quickly</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Technologies and Tools Covered</strong></p><ul><li><p>Flask Framework (Routing, Views, Blueprints, Templates)</p></li><li><p>Jinja2 Templating Engine</p></li><li><p>Flask-SQLAlchemy for Database Integration</p></li><li><p>Flask-Login for Authentication</p></li><li><p>Flask-WTF for Form Handling</p></li><li><p>Celery for Background Tasks</p></li><li><p>RESTful API Development</p></li><li><p>Logging, Error Handling, and Deployment (Heroku, Docker, AWS)</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Take This Course</strong></p><p>This course offers a complete end-to-end understanding of Flask development.

  "description": "<p>Building applications today is no longer just about writing code that works — it’s about creating systems that are <strong>scalable, secure, and easy to maintain</strong>. Traditional monolithic applications often struggle when teams grow, new features are added, or traffic increases. That’s where <strong>microservices with .NET Core</strong> come in.</p><p>In this course, you’ll follow a <strong>hands-on, project-based approach</strong> to learning microservices. Starting from scratch, you’ll create real-world APIs, connect them to SQL Server databases, secure them with JWT authentication, and structure them in a way that makes sense for production-ready systems.</p><p>You’ll go beyond just writing endpoints — you’ll learn how to implement <strong>logging, exception handling, input validation, and configuration management</strong>. As the course progresses, you’ll design <strong>multiple microservices</strong> that communicate with each other, preparing you for real enterprise projects.</p><p>Testing and quality are also central to this course. You’ll explore both <strong>unit testing and integration testing</strong>, using modern frameworks like xUnit and Moq. This ensures your microservices are reliable and maintainable, even as they grow.</p><p>Finally, you’ll learn how to work like a professional developer: using <strong>Git and GitHub</strong> for version control, collaborating through pull requests, and setting up <strong>CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions</strong> to automatically build, test, and deploy your applications.</p><p>By the end of this course, you’ll not only understand the theory of microservices but will have the <strong>practical skills and confidence</strong> to design, build, test, and deploy them in real-world environments.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you ready to take your PHP skills to the next level and start building professional, scalable web applications?<br>Welcome to the <strong>Intermediate PHP Course</strong> — a hands-on, project-based journey designed to bridge the gap between beginner and advanced PHP development.</p><p>In this course, you’ll move beyond the basics of syntax and simple scripts to learn <strong>how to structure, secure, and scale your PHP applications</strong> using modern techniques and best practices. You’ll gain the confidence and clarity needed to write production-ready code and understand how real-world PHP projects are built.</p><p>We’ll begin with a <strong>quick setup and introduction</strong> to ensure your environment is ready (PHP, MySQL, and VS Code). Then we’ll dive deep into <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong> — the foundation of modern PHP. You’ll learn about classes, inheritance, interfaces, traits, and magic methods, and how to use <strong>namespaces</strong> to organize your code efficiently.</p><p>Next, you’ll master <strong>working with files and directories</strong>, including file uploads, permissions, and security best practices. From there, we’ll explore how to work with <strong>databases using PDO</strong>, including prepared statements, transactions, and error handling. You’ll solidify these skills through a mini-project — building a <strong>task manager or notes app</strong> with full CRUD functionality.</p><p>Security is a core focus of this course. You’ll learn to <strong>protect your applications against common attacks</strong> like XSS, CSRF, and SQL Injection, while also understanding proper password hashing, session handling, and secure cookies.</p><p>Then, you’ll move on to <strong>building and consuming APIs</strong>, learning the fundamentals of RESTful design, request routing, responses, HTTP methods, response codes, and JSON data formats. Then you’ll move step-by-step through <strong>building a fully functional REST API</strong> using pure PHP — with clean code organization, routing, error handling, and security best practices. You’ll learn how to connect your API to a <strong>MySQL database using PDO</strong>, work with <strong>CRUD operations</strong>, and return structured JSON responses. <br>Finally, we’ll wrap up with an <strong>introduction to frameworks</strong>, where you’ll learn how frameworks like Laravel implement MVC, routing, controllers, and views. You’ll even learn how to migrate a raw PHP app into Laravel to see the difference in structure and workflow.</p><p>By the end of this course, you’ll have the skills, mindset, and portfolio projects needed to confidently move into <strong>modern PHP development</strong> — whether your goal is to freelance, get hired, or start building your own SaaS apps.<br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you ready to unlock the power of coding and build real websites from scratch? In this <strong><em>12-Day Coding Challenge for Beginners</em></strong><em>,</em> you will embark on a hands-on, focused journey that will introduce you to all the essential tools, languages, and frameworks you need to start your web development career. Over the span of twelve engaging days, you’ll move step-by-step from simple static HTML pages to dynamic, responsive websites with interactive functionality.</p><p>Starting with the foundations, you’ll learn how web applications are structured, how browsers interpret code, and the role of front-end versus back-end development. You’ll begin by mastering HTML and CSS—creating layouts, styling text, images, and forms, understanding colors, fonts, margins, padding, and building designs that look great on any device. Then you’ll dive into JavaScript: discover control structures, loops, DOM manipulation, events, functions, and even asynchronous programming with callbacks and promises.</p><p>As the days progress, you’ll explore popular front-end frameworks like Bootstrap, React, and Vue, and you’ll also learn server-side development with Node.js and Express.js, plus database management with SQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. You’ll understand how to build RESTful APIs, set up authentication, manage version control with Git and GitHub, and deploy your project using platforms such as Heroku, Netlify, and AWS. Security best practices, performance optimization, and modern web capabilities like Progressive Web Apps and WebAssembly will also be part of your toolkit.</p><p>By the end of this challenge, you’ll complete a capstone project—design, develop, and deploy a full-stack web application—that you can include in your portfolio. Whether you aim to become a freelance developer, land a junior developer role, or simply build remarkable websites for your own projects, this challenge gives you the confidence, guided experience, and skills to take off. Let’s code and create together!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Learn Postman with a Postman Supernova.</strong></p><p>RESTful APIs (or simply REST API) are everywhere nowadays, but at the same time, they are getting more complex to get started with: different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH,&nbsp;DELETE), headers, cookies, dealing with file uploads or authentication with API keys, tokens, OAuth and so much more.</p><p>This is where the <strong>Postman App</strong> comes in! Postman allows you very quickly to create a request with the required HTTP method and parameters, submit the request and easily inspect the results. </p><p>I have created this course for testing engineers as well as for software developers or other technical positions. &nbsp;Postman can help you during the development of your API, as well as after the API is completed, by running tests that make sure your API is still working as intended.</p><p>In the first part of the course, we will start exploring the features of Postman and continue by writing API tests with the intention of integrating them into a CI server where the tests will run on a current basis.</p><p>But this is not the normal course you take part in. Because your needs may be different and because I hate leaving you wondering what to do next, the second part of the course will include user questions and answers to problems that were not yet covered in the course or that are more specific and may not interest everybody.</p><p><strong>So let’s look at what you are going to learn:</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT,&nbsp;PATCH, DELETE)</p></li><li><p>JSON format</p></li><li><p>Start with simple requests and advance toward more complex scenarios</p></li><li><p>Learn to deal with authentication/authorization using API Keys</p></li><li><p>Start writing API tests</p></li></ul><p>So after this course, you will know how to use Postman as a pro.</p><p>Excited to learn Postman? Join the course today.</p><p><br></p><p>Legal Disclaimer </p><p>This course is an independent educational resource and is not endorsed by, affiliated with, or associated with Postman, Inc., or any of its products.

  "description": "<p>The internet is the largest source of information in the world—but much of it is locked away inside web pages. Imagine being able to collect product prices, news articles, research data, or any other information directly from websites and transform it into structured data you can use. That’s exactly what this course will teach you to do.</p><p>In <strong>“How to Build a Web Scraper with Python and Beautiful Soup,”</strong> you’ll learn step by step how to set up your environment, write your first scraping scripts, and extract valuable data from real websites. Whether you’re a beginner who has never written a line of code before or someone with basic Python knowledge looking to expand your skills, this course is designed to guide you through the process in a clear and practical way.</p><p>We’ll start by setting up your computer for success—installing Python, creating virtual environments, and installing the Beautiful Soup library. You’ll learn what web scraping is, how it works, and the ethical considerations you need to keep in mind when collecting data online. Next, we’ll dive into HTML fundamentals and use browser tools to inspect elements, identify the data you want, and plan how to extract it.</p><p>From there, you’ll build your first scraping scripts in Python. We’ll walk through every step together: sending requests, parsing HTML with Beautiful Soup, and extracting the text, links, and attributes you need. You’ll learn by doing, creating prototypes of your scraper and testing them until you’re confident with the process. By the end of the course, you’ll have a complete, working scraper that you can customize for your own projects.</p><p>This is not just theory—you’ll be applying your new skills to real-world scenarios. Along the way, you’ll also pick up best practices for organizing your code, handling errors, and saving your data in useful formats such as CSV or JSON.</p><p>By the time you finish this course, you’ll have the knowledge and confidence to build scrapers that can turn almost any website into usable data. Whether you want to analyze trends, automate data collection, or simply explore the power of Python programming, this course will give you the tools you need to get started.</p><p>Enroll today and take your first step into the world of web scraping—one of the most in-demand and practical skills in data and programming.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to <strong>Atomic Design Mastery for Angular: From Theory to Sustainable Practice</strong> — your complete step-by-step guide to building scalable, reusable, and beautiful applications with <strong>Angular 20</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS v4</strong>.</p><p>If you’ve ever struggled with messy components, duplicated styles, or UI elements that are hard to maintain, this course is for you. We’ll take the proven <strong>Atomic Design methodology</strong> and apply it directly to Angular, giving you a clear roadmap for creating applications that grow smoothly without turning into chaos.</p><p>We start with the <strong>basics of Atomic Design</strong>, where you’ll learn how to build Atoms (buttons, inputs, icons) that are clean, testable, and accessible. Then we’ll combine those Atoms into <strong>Molecules</strong> and <strong>Organisms</strong>, forming the building blocks of your UI. From there, you’ll design <strong>Templates and Pages</strong> that define layouts and structure, making your applications consistent and professional.</p><p>Styling is powered by <strong>Tailwind v4</strong>, the latest utility-first CSS framework. You’ll learn how to use tokens, themes, and dark mode to achieve polished designs without writing endless CSS. We’ll also integrate <strong>Angular Material</strong> where needed, ensuring your components stay modern and accessible.</p><p>As you grow more confident, we’ll dive into <strong>state management with Angular Signals</strong>, building services like a shopping cart and dashboard data layers. You’ll practice real-world communication between components while keeping code clean and reactive.</p><p>In the <strong>advanced sections</strong>, we’ll unlock powerful Angular 20 features: content projection, directives, dynamic forms, dependency injection, animations, SSR (Server-Side Rendering), and even micro-frontends. Each lesson is practical and focused, showing you exactly how to apply these tools inside the Atomic Design workflow.</p><p>To make learning engaging, we’ll build <strong>real-world apps</strong> together — an E-Commerce flow, an Admin Dashboard, a Blog, a Social Feed, and a Kanban Board. These projects bring all the concepts together, giving you confidence to use them in your own work. Finally, we’ll run a <strong>Capstone Audit</strong> to check accessibility, performance, and scalability, ensuring you know how to deliver production-ready apps.</p><p>By the end of this course, you’ll not only understand <strong>Atomic Design theory</strong>, but you’ll also be able to implement it in Angular projects from start to finish. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer, you’ll leave with the skills and confidence to create sustainable design systems, reusable components, and applications that teams love to work with.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course contains the use of artificial intelligence. Led by Dr. Amar Massoud, a seasoned expert with decades of academic and professional experience, it combines cutting-edge AI support with human insight to deliver content that is precise, practical, and easy to follow. You’ll gain the clarity of structured learning and the confidence of being guided by a recognized authority.</p><p>The OWASP Top 10 is the most trusted and widely referenced standard for application security risks, and the <strong>2025 edition</strong> reflects today’s rapidly evolving threat landscape. This course provides you with a comprehensive, hands-on understanding of all ten categories — from <strong>Broken Access Control and Cryptographic Failures to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</strong> — and teaches you how to recognize, analyze, and prevent these vulnerabilities in real-world environments.</p><p>Throughout the course, you’ll learn by combining theory with practice. Each section explores a specific OWASP Top 10 category, explains its relevance, and demonstrates its impact using case studies from recent breaches. You’ll also practice applying OWASP-recommended controls through assignments, exercises, and solution walkthroughs, reinforcing your ability to connect security concepts with real-world systems.</p><p>We’ll explore how these vulnerabilities affect modern applications — including <strong>web, API, cloud, and mobile platforms</strong> — and discuss practical mitigation strategies such as secure design patterns, backend validation, encryption standards, API security testing, secure configuration, and supply chain protection. You’ll discover how to apply defensive programming techniques, conduct security assessments, and implement monitoring practices that catch attacks early.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will:</p><ul><li><p>Understand all <strong>OWASP Top 10 (2025)</strong> risks and their real-world consequences</p></li><li><p>Learn how to identify vulnerabilities in code, APIs, and configurations</p></li><li><p>Gain practical strategies to mitigate and prevent common security flaws</p></li><li><p>Be able to analyze case studies and map breaches to OWASP categories</p></li><li><p>Strengthen your ability to design and build <strong>secure applications</strong></p></li></ul><p>Whether you are a <strong>developer, security professional, IT manager, compliance officer, or student</strong> seeking to build expertise in application security, this course gives you the knowledge and skills to protect systems against the most critical threats of 2025.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Security is one of the most critical aspects of web development — yet it is often overlooked by beginners when learning PHP. The truth is, even a small mistake in your code can open the door for attackers to steal sensitive data, compromise user accounts, or take full control of your application. That’s why I created this course: <strong>PHP for Beginners: The Complete PHP Security Course 2025</strong>.</p><p>This course is designed to give you a <strong>step-by-step guide to securing your PHP applications</strong>, even if you are just starting out. You’ll not only learn how hackers exploit insecure PHP code, but also how to <strong>defend against real-world attacks</strong>. We’ll cover everything from SQL Injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), to session fixation, secure file uploads, and safe error handling.</p><p>Through practical examples, I’ll show you exactly how these attacks work and how to fix them. You’ll practice using <strong>prepared statements to secure your database queries</strong>, hashing and verifying passwords with PHP’s modern password functions, and configuring PHP for a production environment. You’ll also learn how to protect your application at the server level using <strong>.htaccess rules, directory restrictions, IP-based protection, and HTTPS enforcement</strong>.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will have the knowledge and confidence to write PHP code that is not only functional, but also <strong>secure and production-ready</strong>. Whether you are building your first web project, working on an eCommerce site, or managing client applications, the skills you learn here will help you protect both your users and your reputation.</p><p>If you’re serious about becoming a PHP developer in 2025, security is no longer optional — it’s a must.

  "description": "<p><strong>Master Full-Stack Web &amp; App Development by Building an AI-Powered E-Commerce Admin Dashboard</strong></p><p>In this monumental 100+ hour course, we will build a complete, production-ready e-commerce administration system from the ground up. You won't just learn individual technologies in isolation; you will architect, build, and deploy a complex, real-world application that integrates a powerful Django backend with a sophisticated Flutter frontend, crowned with a custom-built AI chat agent for intelligent data analysis.</p><p><strong>What You'll Build</strong></p><p>This course is 100% project-based. You will build a single, comprehensive application with features including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Secure Authentication System:</strong> A robust backend with custom user models, JWT for secure API access, email verification, and password reset functionality.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Full-Stack E-Commerce Platform:</strong> Complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for products, categories, and complex product variations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scalable Flutter Admin Panel:</strong> A responsive frontend built using Clean Architecture and the BLoC pattern for predictable state management.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI-Powered Chat Agent:</strong> A revolutionary AI assistant that can query your database for sales analytics, inventory status, and customer insights using&nbsp; <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asynchronous Task Processing:</strong> Integration with Celery and Redis to handle background tasks like sending emails without blocking the main application.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why This Course Is Different</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Real-World Architecture:</strong> We don't cut corners. You'll use industry-standard best practices like Clean Architecture, environment variables for security , and standardized API responses.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Deep Dive into Advanced Concepts:</strong> This isn't a surface-level overview. We cover advanced topics like database caching with Redis , building dynamic API filters , and creating a custom AI framework.</p></li><li><p><strong>The AI Integration (MCP):</strong> The highlight of this course is&nbsp; <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>. You'll learn a groundbreaking method for allowing Large Language Models (LLMs) to safely and effectively interact with your application's data and services, a skill that puts you at the forefront of modern development.</p></li></ul><p>This course is for intermediate developers who are comfortable with the basics of Python and Dart and want to bridge the gap between building small tutorials and architecting professional, large-scale applications. If you are ready to build a project that will dominate your portfolio and prove your expertise, this is the course for you.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you ready to master PHP and gain the confidence to pass technical interviews?<br>This course, <strong>Master PHP From Basics to Advanced Interview Prep</strong>, is your complete learning path to becoming a skilled PHP developer, combining step-by-step lessons with hands-on quizzes that mirror real-world challenges.</p><p>We begin with <strong>PHP basics</strong>, covering variables, operators, data types, and control structures. You’ll strengthen your foundation with <strong>functions, arrays, and string manipulation techniques</strong> including practical use of built-in PHP functions. From there, we move into <strong>forms, superglobals, sessions, and cookies</strong>, teaching you how to build secure and dynamic web applications with proper input validation and sanitization.</p><p>Once you’re confident with the fundamentals, you’ll dive into <strong>databases with MySQL and PDO</strong>. You’ll learn how to connect PHP with MySQL, write secure queries with prepared statements, implement CRUD operations, and defend against SQL injection attacks.</p><p>The course then shifts into <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong> and <strong>modern PHP 8+ features</strong> such as traits, namespaces, attributes, union types, and enums. You’ll also explore exceptions, autoloading, and coding practices that make applications scalable and maintainable.</p><p>To prepare you for the real world, we’ve included <strong>134 practical quizzes</strong> designed around common interview and workplace scenarios. These exercises range from debugging broken code to predicting outputs, refactoring inefficient scripts, and solving security challenges such as preventing XSS and CSRF attacks. You’ll also explore design patterns like Singleton and Factory, as well as strategies for performance optimization and logging.</p><p>By the end of this course, you won’t just “know PHP”—you’ll be able to <strong>apply PHP confidently in professional projects, ace technical interviews, and stand out as a job-ready developer</strong>. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced programmer refreshing your skills, this course will guide you every step of the way.</p>",

My goal was to build a course that starts from the very basics, explains things in plain language, and then gradually builds up to professional-level projects. By the end, students don’t just&nbsp; know HTML and CSS they can actually use them to create real, responsive websites with confidence.</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, you will learn:</p><p>You'll learn How to structure web pages using HTML5 with a clear, semantic approach.</p><p>You'll learn How to style and design your pages using CSS3 with best practices in mind.</p><p>You'll learn How to master the box model, Flexbox, and Grid for powerful layouts.</p><p>You'll learn How to make your websites responsive and mobile-friendly.</p><p>How to apply your knowledge through real-world projects you can showcase</p><p><br></p><p>This course is designed to be practical, project-driven, and easy to follow. Every lesson is carefully explained with examples that build your understanding step by step. Whether your goal is to start a career in front-end development, build freelance projects, or simply gain the skills to create your own websites, this course will give you the tools to get there.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time you finish, you will have a solid foundation in front-end web development, a portfolio of projects to demonstrate your skills, and the confidence to keep moving forward as a developer.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Unlock the full potential of <strong>Ruby on Rails 8</strong> by building a powerful, real-time chat application inspired by the <strong>Telegram Web app</strong>.</p><p>In this fast-paced, practical course, you'll create private and group chat rooms with features like live messaging, user presence, unread notifications, and file attachments. You'll also manage authentication, user roles, and permissions — all in real time.</p><p>We’ll use modern Rails tools and technologies, including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Devise</strong> for authentication</p></li><li><p><strong>ActionCable &amp; WebSockets</strong> for bi-directional, live communication</p></li><li><p><strong>Redis</strong> for real-time unread notification counts as the database and as the Pub/Sub broker for all data updates</p></li><li><p><strong>Stimulus JS</strong> for dynamic frontend behavior</p></li><li><p><strong>Active Storage</strong> for uploading avatars and sharing files</p></li><li><p><strong>Polymorphic associations</strong> and other advanced ActiveRecord patterns</p></li><li><p><strong>Rails Channels </strong>and<strong> WebSocket lifecycle hooks</strong> to track user online/offline status in real time.</p></li></ul><p>You’ll also learn how to:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Build real-time group membership and role systems</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Secure Group Page from Unauthorized Visits</strong> on Server and Client Side in Real Time</p></li><li><p><strong>Display last messages and unread message counts</strong> — instantly</p></li></ul><p>Throughout the course, we’ll explain complex backend logic using <strong>visual diagrams and schemas</strong> to make everything clear and digestible.</p><p>This course is <strong>compact and efficient</strong> — just around <strong>6 hours</strong> — carefully designed to save your time and deliver only the most relevant, high-impact knowledge. Each lecture builds directly on the last, so it's important to follow in sequence for a smooth learning experience.</p><p><strong>Who is this course for?</strong></p><p>This course is perfect for <strong>Rails developers with basic knowledge of MVC, routing, and RESTful APIs</strong>, who want to go beyond CRUD and build something dynamic and production-ready. Familiarity with JavaScript will also help, as we’ll use <strong>Stimulus JS</strong> for frontend interactions.</p><p>If you’ve always wanted to build a <strong>real-time app</strong> with Rails — this is your blueprint.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>F.A.Q</strong></p><p><strong>Q: Will I receive support during the course?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Due to having over 50,000 students across multiple platforms and a full-time job, the instructor isn’t able to provide one-on-one assistance. </p><p><strong>Q: Is this course kept up to date?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. The course is currently updated and fully compatible with Django 5.0.</p><p><strong>Q: Do I get lifetime access after purchasing?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Yes. Once you purchase the course, you’ll have lifetime access, and it will remain available on Udemy.</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Why are the frontend sections only briefly explained?</p><p>A: To keep the course concise and focused, I provide the frontend code with short explanations so you can understand how it connects to the backend logic. The intention is not to deep-dive into frontend frameworks or UI design, but to let you see the complete application flow while keeping the total duration manageable.</p><p>Q: Why does this course focus mostly on the backend?</p><p>A: This course is intentionally designed to help you master backend development with Ruby on Rails. The goal is to give you a clear, practical understanding of backend concepts such as architecture, models, controllers, and database integration — without spending excessive time on frontend topics.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Engineering efficient and scalable backends is such an enjoyable design activity. Understanding the frontend workflows, designing the APIs, picking the right protocols and databases for the task, and determining the communication patterns—whether the workload is CPU- or I/O-intensive—are all part of the fun.</p><p>However, what’s truly more challenging is designing real-time backend applications that support unfettered and ad-hoc bidirectional communication. The workloads of gaming, chatting, and even mission-critical real-time applications are unique in that they require a “push” nature to function effectively.</p><p>I spent a few months designing this course, and I chose the WebSockets protocol as the foundation for this work. WebSockets is by far the most widely available bidirectional protocol, supported across all clients—from browsers and command-line apps to runtimes like Node and Bun, and even other languages like C and Go.</p><p>While there is the newer WebTransport protocol, it isn’t yet as widely supported or battle-tested as WebSockets. Perhaps I’ll refresh this course in a few years when WebTransport matures.</p><p>This course is divided into three main sections:</p><p><strong>1. WebSockets Internals</strong> – A deep dive into the inner workings of the protocol: the handshake, keepalive mechanisms, frame headers, and how it behaves over TLS. We’ll also discuss limitations—because I believe understanding limitations helps us build better applications. Each lecture will include a coding session and a quiz at the end of the section.</p><p><strong>2. Scaling WebSockets</strong> – Taking your WebSocket knowledge to the maximum: how to scale this protocol over HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3. We’ll cover implementation with proxies in both stream mode (Layer 4) and application mode (Layer 7), along with their pros and cons. Each lecture will include a coding session and a quiz at the end of the section.</p><p><strong>3. Building Real-Time System Designs</strong> – Putting everything into practice by designing two systems: an I/O-intensive chat system and a CPU-intensive game. I’ll propose multiple designs for each and choose one to implement.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Fundamentals of Backend Engineering.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the course.</p>",

  "description": "<p>In today’s technology-driven era, real-time communication and artificial intelligence are two of the most transformative forces shaping the way we build modern applications. This comprehensive course is designed to take you step-by-step through the process of creating a fully functional GPT-powered Chat Application using Angular, .NET 9, and SignalR. By the end of this course, you will have the skills, confidence, and deep understanding required to design, develop, and deploy advanced real-time AI-powered applications from scratch.</p><p><br></p><p>We start our journey by laying a strong foundation, introducing the core technologies that power this project. You will learn why Angular is the front-end framework of choice for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces, and how its component-driven architecture ensures scalability and maintainability. Moving to the backend, you will explore the cutting-edge capabilities of .NET 9, which brings performance enhancements, streamlined APIs, and improved developer productivity to the table. Finally, we integrate SignalR, Microsoft’s real-time communication library, to enable instant, bi-directional data transfer between the server and connected clients without the need for constant page refreshes.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the highlights of this course is the seamless integration of OpenAI’s GPT models into our application. You will learn how to consume GPT APIs securely and efficiently, send user messages to the model, and stream AI-generated responses back to the user in real time. By combining SignalR with GPT, we achieve a truly interactive experience where messages appear instantly as they are generated, replicating the feel of live human conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>We will start by setting up the development environment for both front-end and back-end. This includes installing Angular CLI, configuring TypeScript, initializing an Angular workspace, and structuring our project with services, components, and models. On the backend, you will create a new .NET 9 Web API project, configure dependency injection, and set up controllers, hubs, and services required for the SignalR connection and GPT API calls. We will also cover environment-specific configurations, such as securely storing API keys and managing secrets to keep your GPT integration safe and compliant.</p><p><br></p><p>The course is designed for a wide range of learners — whether you are an absolute beginner in full-stack development or an experienced programmer looking to add AI-powered features to your skillset, you will find the content engaging and practical. Every coding concept is explained in detail, supported by diagrams, real-world analogies, and debugging tips to ensure you never feel lost.</p><p><br></p><p>As we progress, we will cover advanced topics such as streaming GPT responses using SignalR, handling concurrency, managing user sessions, and storing chat history in a database for future retrieval. You will learn to create an efficient data model for storing conversations and implement RESTful endpoints that allow retrieval, filtering, and search functionality. On the front-end, we will explore Angular animations and UX improvements to make the chat interface user-friendly and visually appealing.</p><p><br></p><p>Error handling and resilience are critical for production-ready systems, and we will dedicate an entire module to them. You will learn how to gracefully handle API errors, retry failed GPT requests, and display appropriate feedback to the user without breaking the chat flow. In addition, we will cover Polly-based retry patterns in the .NET backend for robust API communication.</p><p><br></p><p>Security is another vital aspect of this course. We will discuss implementing authentication and authorization for your SignalR hub to ensure that only authenticated users can connect and exchange messages. You will also learn how to use JWT tokens for secure user sessions and prevent unauthorized GPT API calls.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is not just about building a chat application; it’s about building a real-world, enterprise-grade solution. That means we will also look into deployment strategies, including hosting your backend on Azure App Service or AWS, deploying the Angular front-end on a cloud platform like Netlify or Vercel, and configuring CI/CD pipelines to automate builds and deployments. By the time you complete these modules, you will be fully capable of taking your own AI-powered applications from concept to production.</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout the course, you will also gain valuable best practices in both Angular and .NET development. In Angular, you will learn about state management, RxJS observables for handling async events, and modular project architecture. In .NET 9, you will learn about minimal APIs, endpoint routing, dependency injection, and performance optimizations that take advantage of the latest .NET runtime improvements.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the most exciting modules focuses on real-time AI-enhanced collaboration features. Imagine multiple users in different locations interacting with the same GPT model in a shared conversation space — you will learn how to synchronize chat states across clients so that everyone sees the same conversation updates instantly. This involves mastering SignalR groups, managing user connections, and broadcasting messages to specific audiences.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of this course, you will have:</p><p><br></p><p>A fully functional GPT-powered real-time chat application built with Angular, .NET 9, and SignalR.</p><p><br></p><p>A deep understanding of how to integrate AI into real-time applications.</p><p><br></p><p>Hands-on experience in managing both front-end and back-end components of a modern web application.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledge of best practices in architecture, security, and deployment.</p><p><br></p><p>The confidence to extend and customize the application to suit different use cases such as customer support bots, AI-assisted writing tools, collaborative learning platforms, and more.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not a quick \"copy-paste\" tutorial. Every line of code is written from scratch with full explanations, so you truly understand why something is done, not just how to do it. You will see the thought process behind structuring services, handling API calls, and optimizing communication between front-end and back-end.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether your goal is to build an AI-powered startup product, add a powerful skill to your resume, or simply explore the intersection of AI and real-time web technologies, this course will give you the tools and knowledge you need. By completing this project, you will be ahead of the curve in one of the most in-demand areas of software development today.</p><p><br></p><p>Join us on this exciting journey and unlock the full potential of AI-powered real-time applications. Let’s combine the magic of GPT with the speed of SignalR and the power of modern frameworks like Angular and .NET 9 to create something truly revolutionary.</p>",

  "description": "<p>You will learn a comprehensive introduction to the principles, concepts, and technologies that form the foundation of modern database systems. Designed for beginners and aspiring software engineers, this course equips learners with the essential skills required to design, develop, manage, and optimize databases in both academic and real-world applications. It bridges theoretical understanding with practical implementation, making it an ideal starting point for anyone interested in data management and backend development.</p><p>The course begins by exploring the basic concepts of data, databases, and database management systems (DBMS). Learners are introduced to the relational model, one of the most widely used paradigms in the industry, including its key components such as tables, rows, columns, keys, and relationships. Through hands-on practice with SQL (Structured Query Language), students gain proficiency in creating and querying databases, manipulating data, and implementing constraints to maintain data integrity.&nbsp; the course also introduces learners to emerging database technologies, including NoSQL systems such as document-based, key-value, and graph databases. This comparative understanding helps learners appreciate different use cases and select appropriate tools based on application requirements.</p><p>Real-world case studies and practical exercises are integrated throughout the course to reinforce theoretical concepts and simulate the challenges faced by database engineers. Students will also explore the role of databases in modern software development, cloud computing, and big data analytics, thereby gaining insight into industry trends and expectations.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Course Description – AWS CDK v2 with TypeScript: Build and Deploy Projects</strong></p><p>This course is a hands-on journey into AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) v2 with TypeScript, designed to help you master Infrastructure as Code (IaC) while building real-world, production-ready stacks. Instead of manually writing CloudFormation templates, you’ll define AWS infrastructure using TypeScript, synthesize it to CloudFormation, and deploy it with the ease of a modern programming workflow.</p><p>You’ll start by setting up your AWS environment—creating your account, configuring budgets to prevent surprise costs, setting up IAM users for CLI access, and installing the AWS CLI and CDK. You’ll learn how to initialize and structure CDK projects, understand stack definitions, and work with deployment commands like cdk deploy, cdk diff, and cdk synth.</p><p>From there, the course walks you through a progressive series of projects, each introducing new AWS services and design patterns:</p><ol><li><p><strong>S3 Bucket Stack</strong> – Create secure, private S3 buckets with proper removal policies and lifecycle management. Learn about static website hosting, public access configurations, and deployment troubleshooting.</p></li><li><p><strong>API Gateway + Lambda + Secrets Manager Stack</strong> – Build HTTP APIs with Lambda backends, manage environment variables, handle CORS, and securely store and retrieve secrets. Explore how to structure Lambda handlers, integrate with API Gateway routes, and enforce cross-stack dependencies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Users API with DynamoDB</strong> – Design a RESTful API for user management with API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB. Implement CRUD operations, generate test data, and manage permissions. Learn about partition keys, billing modes, and DynamoDB query best practices.</p></li><li><p><strong>Product Management Stack</strong> – Combine DynamoDB for product data and S3 for image storage, building APIs for product creation, retrieval, and deletion. Manage IAM permissions, handle file uploads, and optimize Lambda execution for performance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Event-Driven Workflows with SQS</strong> – Integrate Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) into a document processing pipeline with Lambda and API Gateway, ensuring reliable, decoupled communication between services.</p></li></ol><p>Throughout the course, you’ll gain experience in:</p><ul><li><p>Designing scalable, maintainable CDK stacks.</p></li><li><p>Managing multiple stacks and their dependencies.</p></li><li><p>Using NodejsFunction for automatic TypeScript bundling with esbuild.</p></li><li><p>Configuring resource policies for safe deletion in development and data retention in production.</p></li><li><p>Understanding AWS service pricing models and cost optimization strategies.</p></li><li><p>Handling common deployment errors and using troubleshooting techniques.</p></li></ul><p>By the end, you’ll have a portfolio of deployed AWS projects, a strong grasp of CDK fundamentals, and the ability to design and deploy complex cloud architectures in a repeatable, version-controlled manner. Whether you’re aiming to enhance your DevOps skills, automate infrastructure deployments, or build cloud-native applications, this course gives you the practical knowledge and confidence to do it efficiently with AWS CDK v2 and TypeScript.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to <strong>OpenIddict with .NET – The Ultimate Identity Adventure</strong> — your all-in-one guide to mastering secure authentication and identity management in .NET applications!</p><p>In today’s world, securing user identity is critical. This course makes complex topics like <strong>OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and token-based authentication</strong> easy and fun, even if you’re new to these concepts.</p><p>You’ll start with the basics: <strong>What is OpenIddict, and why is it the perfect partner for .NET developers?</strong> We’ll explore how it simplifies building secure login systems with <strong>up to 80% less configuration</strong> compared to traditional approaches — meaning you spend more time coding features and less time fighting boilerplate.</p><p>Next, dive into the heart of modern authentication standards — <strong>OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect</strong>. Learn how these protocols work together to keep user data safe and enable seamless login experiences.</p><p>We’ll break down the different OAuth flows — from the simple password flow to the more secure authorization code flow — explaining when and why to use each.</p><p>You’ll gain <strong>hands-on experience</strong> implementing these flows in your .NET apps, with <strong>step-by-step code walkthroughs</strong> and clear explanations.</p><p>Managing users and roles is crucial for any secure app. You’ll learn how to integrate OpenIddict with <strong>ASP.NET Core Identity</strong> to handle registration, login, role management, and password resets securely.</p><p>We’ll also cover building <strong>consent screens</strong> — those friendly prompts that ask users for permission — to enhance user trust and comply with privacy standards.</p><p>But that’s not all! You’ll secure your APIs by implementing the right OAuth flows to control access, whether users or apps are calling your services.</p><p> <strong>Real-world benefits you’ll gain:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Zero-Boilerplate Focus:</strong> Up to 80% less setup, so you can ship faster.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Save thousands by hosting your own OpenIddict server instead of paying for expensive third-party services.</p></li><li><p><strong>Future-Proof Skills:</strong> Master protocols used by companies worldwide to protect millions of users.</p></li></ul><p>Throughout the course, expect <strong>practical tips, best practices, and advice to avoid common security mistakes</strong>.</p><p>This course is perfect for <strong>.NET developers, backend engineers, and anyone eager to understand modern identity management</strong>.</p><p>No confusing jargon or overly technical lectures — just <strong>simple, clear, and interactive lessons</strong> with a friendly instructor guiding you all the way.</p><p>By the end, you’ll be confident building <strong>secure, professional authentication systems</strong> that protect users and data — whether you’re creating small web apps or scaling to enterprise-level solutions.</p><p>Join now and unlock your <strong>identity superpowers</strong> with <strong>OpenIddict and .NET</strong>!</p>",

  "description": "<p>This beginner-friendly course offers a hands-on introduction to cloud computing using Amazon Web Services (AWS), ideal for aspiring cloud professionals and IT enthusiasts. Over six structured weeks, you'll learn the fundamentals of cloud computing—including IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS—and explore the AWS ecosystem, its global infrastructure, and the Free Tier. The course focuses on core AWS services such as EC2 for compute, S3 and EBS for storage, and RDS and DynamoDB for databases. You'll get practical experience launching and securing EC2 instances, managing storage with S3 buckets and EBS volumes, and configuring networking components like VPCs and subnets. You'll also learn key AWS security practices using IAM roles and policies, and monitor resources with CloudWatch. The course wraps up with a capstone project where you'll deploy a simple web application using EC2, S3, and RDS, applying all the skills you've acquired. Each week includes video lectures, guided labs, quizzes, and resources from official AWS documentation. The course is designed to prepare you for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam and offers a certificate of completion upon meeting assessment requirements. By the end, you’ll confidently deploy and manage cloud infrastructure, implement basic security and cost controls, and take the next step toward a career in cloud computing. No prior AWS experience is required—just a basic understanding of IT concepts and a willingness to learn. Whether you're looking to skill up or start a cloud certification path, this course provides a solid foundation for your AWS journey.</p>",

  "description": "<p>JavaScript is the backbone of modern web development and a critical skill in technical interviews for frontend and full-stack roles. This course provides an in-depth multiple-choice question (MCQ) based approach to help you master Core JavaScript and confidently tackle interview questions.</p><p>The course includes <strong>1000+ curated questions</strong>, each designed to test and reinforce your understanding of the most important and frequently asked JavaScript concepts. After each question, you'll receive detailed explanations that not only reveal the correct answer but also explain <em>why</em> other options are incorrect — promoting deeper understanding and critical thinking.</p><p>Topics covered include variables and scoping, data types, closures, this keyword, asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await), hoisting, prototype chain, ES6+ enhancements, functional programming, and more. Whether you're brushing up for a job interview or aiming to improve your daily coding confidence, this course covers it all.</p><p>Unlike passive tutorials, this active learning method will help you retain knowledge longer and spot tricky interview pitfalls more easily. The MCQs range from beginner to advanced levels, allowing learners of all backgrounds to benefit.</p><p>This course is ideal for engineers targeting roles at tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, or startups — or anyone wanting to future-proof their JavaScript knowledge.</p><p>By the end, you'll have a sharper, more confident command of JavaScript and be interview-ready.<br><br>Topics Are :-<br></p><p><strong>1.

  "description": "<p>Welcome to Building Interactive Websites with Next JS, React, Leaflet course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn how to build real estate marketplace and customer feedback analytics websites using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This course is a perfect combination between web development and web design, making it an ideal opportunity to practice your programming skills while improving your technical knowledge in Javascript. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Next JS, such as getting to know its use cases, technical limitations, and main features. Then, in the next section, we will start the first project. We are going to build a real estate marketplace website using Next JS and Leaflet JS, This website will have three main features. The first feature is an interactive map that displays property listings using Leaflet JS, where each property is represented by a clickable marker showing detailed information such as price, address, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, property type, and contact details, all rendered dynamically with React. The second feature is a built in mortgage calculator developed with plain JavaScript that allows users to input their income and loan terms to estimate the maximum property price they can afford, along with a clear breakdown of monthly payments including mortgage principal, taxes, and insurance. The third feature is a user friendly property listing form created using React and HTML, where users will be able to submit new property listings by entering details like location, price, property type, and contact information, then it will be instantly added to the map without reloading the page. Afterward, in the second project, we are going to build a customer feedback analytics website using Next JS. This website will also have three main features. The first feature allows users to manually type in a customer feedback through a simple text input form, once submitted, the system will process the text and instantly determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral, using a sentiment analysis function facilitated by Javascript library. The second feature enables users to upload a CSV file containing multiple customer feedbacks, where the system will automatically analyze each feedback, assign sentiment labels, and display the results in a well structured format with clear summaries and visual highlights. The third feature presents a dynamic pie chart, built using a charting library, that visualizes the proportion of positive, negative, and neutral feedback, helping users quickly interpret the overall sentiment trends across all analyzed customer data. Lastly at the end of the course, we will conduct testing to make sure the websites are fully functioning and all logics have been implemented correctly, we will be focusing on two testing objectives, performance testing and functional testing.</p><p>Firstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask these questions to ourselves, why should we build websites using Next JS and React? Well, here is my answer. Next JS and React provide strong foundations for building fast, interactive, and modern web applications with clean code structure and strong developer support. By using these technologies, you can take advantage of features like automatic routing, reusable components, and seamless client side interactions, which make development more efficient. Most importantly, they allow you to deliver a smoother user experience, which is essential when building websites that involve real time interaction and dynamic content like maps and data visualization.</p><p>Below are things that you can expect to learn from this course:</p><ul><li><p>Learn the basic fundamentals of Next JS, such as getting to know its use cases, technical limitations, and main features</p></li><li><p>Learn how to build real estate marketplace website using Next JS, React, and Leaflet JS</p></li><li><p>Learn how to build customer feedback analytics website using Next JS and React</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create state management and property data structure</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create tab navigation and layout structure</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create and integrate interactive map using Leaflet</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create mortgage calculator</p></li><li><p>Learn how to build property search filter</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create property listing form</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create customer feedback analytics page layout</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create text input form</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create function for performing sentiment analysis</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create functions for uploading data and parsing CSV file</p></li><li><p>Learn how to visualise sentiment analysis data using pie chart</p></li><li><p>Learn how to conduct functional and performance testing</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>In today’s fast-paced tech world, mastering JavaScript is more than just memorizing syntax - it’s about building real, interactive experiences. And what better way to learn programming than by making games? With <strong>Code &amp; Play</strong>, you’ll strengthen your programming skills through creativity, logic, and hands-on coding that’s actually fun.</p><p>This isn’t your typical tutorial-based course. In this immersive learning experience, you’ll build a collection of <strong>15 playable games</strong>—each one crafted to teach you key JavaScript concepts while keeping you engaged. From classics like Rock-Paper-Scissors, Pong, and Snake to original projects like key matcher or memory card game, every project is a chance to sharpen your skills in a meaningful way.</p><p>You’ll work with real JavaScript fundamentals: variables, functions, loops, objects, arrays, and event listeners—all applied directly to build game mechanics and interactivity. You’ll also dive into slightly more advanced topics like collision detection, game state management, animations and drawing with the HTML5 Canvas API.</p><p>But this course is about more than just writing code. It’s about learning <strong>how to think like a developer</strong> -debugging issues, solving logic problems, and organizing your code in a clean, modular way. Every game is a challenge designed to stretch your problem-solving skills and reinforce your understanding of JavaScript through real feedback loops.</p><p>By the end, you won’t just know how JavaScript works—you’ll <strong>have a personal arcade of games you built yourself</strong>, and a strong portfolio of projects that demonstrate your abilities in an exciting, creative format.</p><p>Whether you're new to programming or looking for a fun way to level up your JavaScript, this course will help you build confidence, deepen your knowledge, and unlock a whole new way to learn.</p><p>Let’s code, play, and build something awesome - one game at a time.</p>",

We’ll cover authentication, data modeling, and the use of Supabase client libraries to manage user sessions and perform database operations.</p><p>The core of the course focuses on building your application from scratch. You’ll develop components for user authentication (signup, login, password reset), secure account management (update password, delete account), and CRUD operations for notes. You’ll also implement feedback systems like toast notifications and design a clean user interface using CSS and modern React practices.</p><p>But we won’t stop at building the app. You’ll also learn essential development skills like version control using Git and GitHub, and how to test your app locally for production readiness. Finally, we’ll walk through the process of deploying your fullstack application to a live cloud environment, so you can share your project with the world or showcase it in your developer portfolio.</p><p>This course is perfect for aspiring developers, students, or freelancers who want to learn practical fullstack development using tools that are free, modern, and in high demand. No prior experience with React or Supabase is required—everything is explained clearly, with real-time examples and a focus on hands-on practice.</p><p>By the end of this course, you’ll have:</p><ul><li><p>A fully functional, deployed fullstack web application</p></li><li><p>Practical experience working with React, Supabase, Git, and cloud hosting</p></li><li><p>The confidence to build, manage, and deploy your own projects</p></li><li><p>A solid foundation for future learning or job opportunities in web development</p></li></ul><p>If you’re looking to learn by building something real, this course will give you the structure, guidance, and support to succeed.

  "description": "<p>Welcome to CSS Animation, Javascript Animation, Tailwind for Web Design course. This is a comprehensive tutorial for web designers and web developers who are interested in animating web components and designing interactive websites using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Tailwind, and Python. This course is a perfect combination between animation and web design, making it an ideal opportunity to practice your programming skills while improving your technical knowledge in web development. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of web animation, such as getting to know its use cases, its technical limitations, and different types of animations commonly used in web design. Then, in the next section we will start the project, In the first section, we will start with CSS animation tutorials, we are going to create variety of animations like text animation, floating animation, bouncing animation, rotating animation, zoom in animation, button animation, gradient background colour transition, and menu dropdown animation. This will give you a solid foundation in using CSS to make web elements visually engaging and interactive. Afterward, in the second section, we will animate web components using Javascript and Anime JS, we are going to create fully animated countdown timer, following that, we are going to create an animated cursor that follows the mouse with a floating bubble effect, and we are also going to create colourful isometric animation. This will train you to effectively combine JavaScript with animation libraries to design seamless, responsive, and highly engaging interactions that enhance user engagement and elevate the overall web experience. Then, in the third section, we will design interactive websites using Tailwind CSS, specifically, we are going to design and animate flight booking pages and pricing pages. These layouts will include hover transitions, animated buttons, and responsive designs. In the fourth section, we will create beautiful animations using Python and turtle, we are going to create colourful loading spinner animation and a growing tree animation that can be used as a decorative background element on a web page. Then, in the fifth section, we will animate data visualization using D3 JS, specifically, we are going to build a bar chart that visualizes the population growth of a city over ten years, complete with animated transitions and dynamic rendering. This will show you how to present complex data interactively while maintaining a clean and engaging user interface. Lastly, at the end of the course, we are going to build and design an ecommerce product page that includes flipping card animations. The front of each card will display a product image and title, while the back reveals the product description and price, additionally, we are also going to create an animated add to cart button.</p><p>Before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we learn about web animations? Well, here is my answer, animations play a crucial role in modern web design. Animation can help to guide user attention, enhances interactivity, and makes websites feel more dynamic and engaging. It not only boosts the visual appeal but also adds emotion and personality to digital experiences, making them more memorable. In addition, from a business perspective, having a fully animated website can strengthen brand identity and potentially increase conversion rate.</p><p>Below are things that you can expect to learn from this course:</p><ul><li><p>Learn the basic fundamentals of web animation, such as getting to know its use cases, technical limitation, and different type of animations</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create text animation using CSS</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create button animation using CSS</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create dropdown menu animation using CSS</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create gradient background colour transition using CSS</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create floating and bouncing animations using CSS</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create rotate and zoom in animations using CSS</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create countdown timer animation using Javascript</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create cursor animation using Javascript</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create colourful isometric animation using Javascript</p></li><li><p>Learn how to design flight booking page with Tailwind CSS</p></li><li><p>Learn how to design pricing page with Tailwind CSS</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create loading spinner animation using Python and Turtle</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create background animation using Python and Turtle</p></li><li><p>Learn how to animate data visualization using D3 JS</p></li><li><p>Learn how to design and animate Ecommerce product page using CSS</p></li></ul>",

This course is designed for developers who want to build scalable, secure backend systems using modern practices with Express.js and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.</p><p>In the <strong>first part</strong> of this course, we start by setting up a clean and organized Express.js project using the MVC structure. You’ll learn how to separate your codebase into models, views, and controllers to create maintainable and scalable applications. We'll cover routing, middleware, and folder structuring—everything needed to prepare a professional-grade backend foundation.</p><p>The <strong>second part</strong> dives into JWT—what it is, how it works, and why it’s one of the most widely used methods for stateless authentication. You’ll learn how to generate, sign, verify, and protect routes using JWTs. By the end, you'll have built a fully functional authentication system from scratch, including secure login, registration, token refresh, and protected routes.</p><p>This course is perfect for developers familiar with a fairly good knowledge regarding JavaScript who want to deepen their backend skills and build real-world authentication systems using JWT.</p><p><br></p><p>In the&nbsp; course I do not mention the <strong>Session authentication system</strong> which has advantages and disadvantages compared to the JWT token .

You'll also explore error handling and exception management, ensuring your applications are robust and user-friendly, even when things go wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Beyond the core language, we'll equip you with practical, real-world skills. You'll learn about working with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to connect your PHP applications with external services, understand session management for user authentication, and implement crucial security measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities. </p><p><br></p><p>We'll touch upon modern PHP development practices, including the use of Composer for dependency management, and introduce you to the concepts of MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, setting you up for success with popular PHP frameworks.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of this immersive experience, you won't just have theoretical knowledge; you'll have a portfolio of practical projects and the confidence to tackle real-world development challenges. </p><p><br></p><p>You'll be ready to build anything from dynamic blogs and e-commerce platforms to custom content management systems and sophisticated web services.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is ideal for:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Absolute beginners</strong> with no prior coding experience who are eager to start their journey in web development.</p></li><li><p><strong>Front-end developers</strong> looking to expand their skillset and become full-stack developers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aspiring backend developers</strong> who want to build a strong foundation in PHP.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anyone</strong> who dreams of creating their own dynamic websites and web applications.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Don't just learn PHP – master it.

  "description": "<p>Hi, and welcome to this course! My name is Andrii Bortnikov, and I am a Software Engineer specializing in Adobe Experience Manager.<br><br>This is the first course in a two-course series dedicated to Adobe Experience Manager. In this course, we will start learning Adobe Experience Manager from scratch. </p><p><br></p><p>We'll start with the Introduction section, where we’ll get familiar with Adobe Experience Manager, its history, different versions, and so on.</p><p>Next, we'll cover the installation process, discuss the local development flow, and explore the codebase of an AEM project.</p><p>After that, we will learn about different fundamental concepts and features, such as pages, the repository, package management, learn about templates and template types, policies, components, and so on.</p><p>Then, we will dive deeper into the coding aspects and learn about the HTML Template Language, Client-Side Libraries, the ui.frontend module, the Style System, and so on.</p><p>Then, we’ll go even further, and learn about the Apache Sling Framework, Sling Models, explore different AEM APIs, learn about the OSGi Framework, as well as different environments, run modes, Sling Servlets, Sling Filters, and so on.</p><p>Then, we will also have a dedicated section on testing our AEM code, where we will learn how to test everything we learned in the previous sections.</p><p>Then, once we’re done with that, we’ll learn about even more AEM features, such as Experience Fragments, Assets, Content Fragments, and Tags.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, great! So, as you can see, this is quite a comprehensive course. And because of that, let’s talk a little bit about how to get the most out of it:</p><ul><li><p>First of all, the topics in this course are structured logically, starting from the basics and moving to more advanced concepts. So, you do not need to have any prior knowledge of AEM; we’ll learn everything step by step. And, because of this, I highly recommend following the course sequentially, without skipping any lessons.</p></li><li><p>Secondly, I really encourage you to take notes or even code along with me.</p></li><li><p>Then, there are also homework assignments for almost every section, sometimes even more than one. And, I strongly encourage you to complete these assignments and then review my solutions as well. That way, you’ll not only learn the theory but also gain practical experience.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Okay, great! I hope you are now familiar with the structure of this course.</p><p>But, in order to support the course videos, I’ve also created a GitHub repository containing all the code we’ll write throughout the course. For each section, there is a starting branch, which contains the code before we begin the section, and a finalized branch containing the completed code for that section. So, this way, you can always review the entire codebase or compare your code with mine if you have any questions. And, you’ll find the link to the GitHub repository in the file attached to the Introduction video.</p><p>Also, if you’d like to connect with me, you can find the link to my LinkedIn profile in the file attached to the Introduction video.</p><p>I’ve also created a Discord community where we can discuss AEM and where I’ll post updates regarding this course. You can find the link to the Discord community in that file as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, great!</p><p>So, that’s pretty much it. Let's start learning AEM!</p>",

You’ll also get practical experience with event handling, working directly with the <strong>DOM</strong>, and modern ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, modules). Every lesson includes clear explanations, live coding demos, and exercises you can adapt right away.</p><p>By the end, you’ll have the confidence to build dynamic web interfaces from scratch—and the solid understanding that makes learning frameworks fast and intuitive.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What You’ll Learn</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Core Language:</strong> Variables, data types, operators, and control flow</p></li><li><p><strong>Functions &amp; Scope:</strong> Declarations, expressions, arrow functions, closures</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Structures:</strong> Arrays, objects, Maps/Sets, and iteration techniques</p></li><li><p><strong>Modern ES6+ Features:</strong> Template literals, destructuring, spread/rest, modules</p></li><li><p><strong>Object-Oriented JavaScript:</strong> Constructor functions, classes, prototypes</p></li><li><p><strong>Asynchronous Programming:</strong> Callbacks, Promises, async/await</p></li><li><p><strong>Browser APIs:</strong> DOM selection/manipulation, event handling, AJAX/fetch</p></li><li><p><strong>Coding Best Practices:</strong> Clean code, debugging strategies, performance tips</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Why This Matters</strong></p><p>Frameworks like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Vue</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, and <strong>Next.js</strong> build on these exact concepts. <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> and other styling tools work most effectively when you know how JavaScript truly operates.

  "description": "<p><strong>In this multi-part tutorial series, you'll learn how to build visually rich, interactive timelines for a custom music player—using nothing but vanilla JavaScript and CSS. In the first video we begin by creating a static time display that forms the foundation of our timeline UI. In the second video we take it a step further by transforming the static time into a rotating, animated time interface, adding a unique visual twist. In the third video we explore waveform timelines—starting with a static waveform and then building a dynamic version that responds to user input in real time as you scrub through the track.

  "description": "<p>Welcome to Web Development Bootcamp: Building SaaS with Python &amp; Django course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn how to build a fully functional expense tracker SaaS website from scratch using Django, HTML, and CSS. This course is a perfect combination between Python and web development, making it an ideal opportunity to practice your programming skills while improving your technical knowledge in SaaS business. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Django, such as getting to know its use cases and technical limitations. Then, in the next section we will create the project folder and install all Python packages needed for this project. Afterward, we will start the project. Firstly, we are going to create a function to enable users to upload a file or image and build optical character recognition using EasyOCR so the system can extract text and transaction amounts from the scanned receipt. This feature enables users to save time by automatically capturing essential expense details without the need for manual entry. Next, we are going to create a function to allow users to add, update, and delete transactions manually. This feature enables users to manage their data with full flexibility and maintain accurate records. Following that, we are also going to create a spending tracker dashboard where users can view a table of recent transactions in a structured and readable layout. This feature enables users to easily track their day to day expenses and gain a clear overview of their spending activity. In the next section, we are going to build expense categorization and data visualization features, allowing users to assign categories such as utilities, travel, healthcare, shopping, entertainment, food and dining. Additionally, the users will also be able to visualize their spending data, for example, the system can present the data using a bar chart to show the top three spending categories and a pie chart showing category breakdown in percentages format. Then, after that, we are going to create a system that detects duplicate transactions and allows users to remove them, while also enabling users to set budget limits for each category. This feature enables users to avoid redundant entries and receive alerts or notification when their spending exceeds the budget. In addition, we are going to create synthetic data for simulation, which will support testing and demonstration purposes. Lastly, at the end of the course, we will conduct functional and performance testing to ensure each feature works correctly and the website performs well under different conditions.</p><p>Firstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we use Django for web development? Well, here is my answer, Django is a powerful and well organized web framework that helps developers build secure and robust applications quickly. It handles many common tasks, such as user authentication, form handling, database operations, and page routing. This allows you to focus more on building your core features instead of starting everything from scratch. Even if you have limited experience in front end web development, Django makes the process easier by providing built in tools and a clear project structure. Additionally, Django is easy to integrate with other tools and supports a smooth deployment process, making it a great choice for building any type of websites or applications.</p><p>Below are things that you can expect to learn from this course:</p><ul><li><p>Learn the basic fundamentals of Django, such as getting to know its use cases, technical limitations, and main features</p></li><li><p>Learn how to build spending tracker SaaS using Python, Django, HTML, and CSS</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create web home page and add multiple tabs</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create function for uploading file</p></li><li><p>Learn how to build optical character recognition system using EasyOCR</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create functions to add, update, and delete data</p></li><li><p>Learn how to build spending analytics dashboard</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create functions for generating bar chart and pie chart</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create function to detect duplicates</p></li><li><p>Learn how to set up page routing and create custom filters</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create HTML document structure and style tabs using CSS</p></li><li><p>Learn how to design navigation and tab structure</p></li><li><p>Learn how to design user interface for file scanner and OCR</p></li><li><p>Learn how to design user interface for expense &amp; analytics dashboard</p></li><li><p>Learn how to design user interface for duplicate detection and budget alert tabs</p></li><li><p>Learn how to perform functional and performance testing</p></li></ul>",
