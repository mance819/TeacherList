  "description": "<p><strong>Are you a beginner to React, Redux or Material UI ?</strong></p><p><strong>Do you feel setting up redux-saga, understanding and remembering it is difficult ?</strong></p><p><strong>Do you find it difficult to understand all the different pieces involved like Webpack, JSX and Transpilation ?</strong></p><p><strong>Are you confused about how to properly unit test React components using Jest ?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Don't worry, I have been there too.</p><p><br></p><p>So I decided to create a workshop for it in order to bring clarity to the absolute beginners who want to get started in just 1 day. You just need basic javascript knowledge to join the workshop</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Skills can pay the bills.</strong></p><p>The number of jobs for the trio combination of ( React, Redux, Material-UI ) has increased and they are demanding skills to have in your CV in 2021.</p><p>The fact is, not everyone can easily understand and start building projects with React and use Redux with Material UI right away. But as a beginner, you will need a bit of push. Online documentation is great. I don't deny it. But with my hands-on experience, I believe I can help you give that initial push. Code with me and learn how to bootstrap without generators.</p><p><br></p><p>We will be using concepts like react hooks, redux setup, refs, material components &amp; state persistence while building this React app and then give you the source code for future reference. You can use this as a bootstrap while working on your office projects and quickly configure stuff. Say No to StackOverflow for things that you can remember. This saves you time to focus on the core logic in your projects.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Unit testing with Jest</strong></p><p>Unit testing the redux state of a react component is so critical because the reducer function dictates the behaviour of your app simply because it controls the entire state.</p><p>Mocking external libraries and exports are crucial during testing because we are interested to verify only our code changes.</p><p>In order to achieve this, we will make use of jest mock fn( ) to bypass the undesired portions of the code and make sure our redux reducer is stable and protected from future code changes which may introduce potential damage.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope you like the workshop.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Warm regards,</strong></p><p>Manoj Satish Kumar</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>The next big thing:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you think React, Vue and Angular are the only popular front-end frameworks, you're missing out on the next big thing: SVELTE!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Svelte?</strong></p><p>Svelte is a radical new way of handling frontend. It brings the best of both worlds .. it lets you create your front-end in a modular way. It has components, events, messages, data stores -- everything a modern framework has. BUT ... it doesn't come with all the baggage of performance overhead. Svelte achieves this by compiling your code once on the server-side and sending pure javascript to the browser. </p><p>This makes frontends written in Svelte blazingly fast and extremely easy to maintain. This is why many believe Svelte to be the future of front-end development. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Get This Course?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>With this course, you can learn the best practices in Svelte and how to use it to create real-world applications. We cover all important aspects of Svelte including: </p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Svelte constructs</p></li><li><p>Components </p></li><li><p>Component interactions and properties </p></li><li><p>Events, handlers and messages</p></li><li><p>Svelte shorthands to save time </p></li><li><p>Stores and best practices associated with them </p></li><li><p>... most importantly, see how to connect Svelte to the backend through REST in the best way possible!&nbsp; </p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>What You Will Learn?</strong></p><p>By the end of the course, you'll have a thorough understanding of the philosophy of Svelte and you would be able to dive even deeper into your particular use case. This is supposed to be the first step in your journey towards compiled frontends. Take this first step and the rest of the stuff will be much, much easier for you. You will understand the philosophy of Svelte and the official docs will make much more sense to you so that you can continue to learn on your own independently! </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support and Money Back Guarantee</strong></p><p>Finally, I provide exceptional support for all my courses. All questions are answered within 24 hours. Plus, if you don't like the contents, I absolutely do not mind if you take advantage of the 30-day money-back guarantee! </p><p>As you might be able to see through this text, I'm very passionate about Svelte. So, join me now and let's create some projects with Svelte!</p>",

  "description": "<p><em>\"This course was well designed and gave very in-depth classes on specific features of Angular and Node. I found each section clear and easy to follow and the project really wrapped up everything in a fun to code along project!\" </em></p><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Robin Labonde</p><p><br></p><p>Welcome the <strong>Angular 8 Real World WebApp Development with Node.js &amp; MariaDB</strong> course!</p><p>In this course, we’ll focus on <strong>building a real-world web application</strong> with the tools Angular and Node.js provide.</p><p>We will build an <strong>SEO friendly</strong> blog, which means we're going to use<strong> Angular Universal</strong> to build a <strong>server-side rendered</strong> front end.</p><p>In the back end, we're going to use <strong>Node.js</strong> for the web service, we store our data in a <strong>MariaDB </strong>and to map our objects with the database, we’re going to use the object-relational mapping library <strong>Sequelize</strong>.</p><p>And finally, we publish the whole thing on a <strong>Windows Server</strong> with <strong>IISNode</strong>.</p><p>The web application itself will be a blog that could be extended to a big news or magazine web application.</p><p>We start with displaying some articles and later on we'll build an<strong> administration dashboard</strong> with <strong>authentication </strong>(we're using <strong>JSON Web Tokens</strong> to be more specific) and the option to create new articles, modify them, and so on.</p><p>Let's have a deeper look at what you are going to learn in this course:</p><p><strong><em>The Basic Blog</em></strong></p><p>In this section, we will start with our Angular project and develop the blog, so that it will work offline - without any web service or database. In essence, you could already publish this blog if you want to add all your blog posts within your Angular app.</p><p><strong><em>Meta &amp; Open Graph Tags</em></strong></p><p>As the title may already imply, here we will add meta tags and open graph tags. So the information that <strong>search engines</strong> and <strong>social media platforms</strong> need to find your blog and display your articles properly when they are shared.</p><p>Keep in mind though, that these tags won’t necessarily work if you stick with a client-side rendered Angular app. Google promised to be able to crawl client-side rendered Angular web applications, but by the experience of many blogs and developers, we are not there yet.</p><p>Apart from that, social media platforms still need proper source code or tags to scrape your site properly.</p><p><strong><em>Angular Universal</em></strong></p><p>A short but important section - we will implement <strong>server-side rendering (SSR)</strong> here. That’s what <strong>Angular Universal</strong> is all about. When you finished implementing server-side rendering, your tags will be available in the source of your blog and your pages will also <strong>render much faster</strong>.</p><p><strong><em>Back end with Node.js</em></strong></p><p>It’s time for the backend. We’ll create a new project, the web service with <strong>Node.js</strong>. Now the articles will come from the web service.</p><p><strong><em>Database &amp; ORM with MariaDB &amp; Sequelize</em></strong></p><p>We expand the web service and finally connect our web application with a database so that the articles are now <strong>stored in a MariaDB</strong>. Additionally, we will use Sequelize for the <strong>object relational mapping </strong>between our models and the database tables.</p><p><strong><em>Administration Dashboard</em></strong></p><p>In essence, the blog works with all layers. We have the client, the web service and the database. But adding new articles and modifying them is a bit cumbersome. So let’s add an administration panel where we get an overview of all articles and where we can create, update and delete them - this means, building all <strong>CRUD operations</strong>.</p><p><strong><em>Authentication</em></strong></p><p>The administration dashboard works, but until now, everybody could use it. In this section, we change that by adding authentication with <strong>JSON web tokens</strong>. Also, we’re going to introduce Angular <strong>interceptors</strong>, <strong>route guards</strong> and a small <strong>middleware</strong>.</p><p><strong><em>IISNode</em></strong></p><p>Finally, we are able to deploy our blog. In this section, you’re going to learn how to build and <strong>publish the Angular Universal client</strong> and the Node web service on a Windows Server with Internet Information Services.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What tools are we using?</strong></p><p>All the tools we're going to use in this course are available for free.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> - A source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. We will use this code editor for the Angular client application as well as the Node.js web service.</p></li><li><p><strong>HeidiSQL</strong> - A free and open-source administration tool we will use and install together with MariaDB. It's perfectly suited to see the data we're going to store in the database.</p></li><li><p><strong>Postman</strong> - A greate choice for API testing. Later during this course, we will use Postman to run API calls against the Node.js web service.</p></li><li><p><strong>Google Chrome</strong> - It's not necessary to use Google Chrome, any web browser with developer tools is useful here. We're going to use the developer tools for its console output and inspecting the HTML of our web application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Git</strong> - This one's totally optional. I recommend using Git as source control. You can use it locally or push your code to a hoster like GitHub. The complete code written in this course is available on GitHub, for instance.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Who is this course for?</strong></p><p>This course is suited for students who...</p><ul><li><p>...already have a little experience with Angular</p></li><li><p>...want to up their game with Angular and Node.js</p></li><li><p>...learn the skills to build a modern web application with Angular, Node.js, MariaDB and Sequelize from the ground up</p></li><li><p>...want to create a portfolio website or private blog completely on their own without using any third-party services</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Who is the instructor?</strong></p><p>Patrick is an experienced web developer who has been working in this field for over 15 years. With several courses on Udemy, over 30.000 students and more than 3.000 reviews, he knows what you are looking for in a course about web development. He works full-time as full stack developer at a market research company in Germany, teaches online courses on Udemy and YouTube, and also gives one-on-one online lectures. Let's see, what other students are saying:</p><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p><p>\"<em>Patrick is an incredibly gifted programmer and educator. He writes code effortlessly and does a beautiful job of explaining concepts, the code structure, and how everything interacts with each other. He is patient and supportive and can efficiently work with beginners and people with more advanced skill. If you want to learn any aspects of programming, you MUST contact Patrick. He’s among the best instructors I’ve ever worked with, and I give him my highest recommendation.</em>\" - Mike</p><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p><p>\"<em>Very good, easy pace, and easy to understand! this is the good course for beginner and intermediate developers. Thank you!</em>\" -Tri </p><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p><p>\"<em>Quick and useful course getting someone upto speed on WCF RESTful services. I like this course as the instructor Patrick just gets to the crux of the topics without padding with unnecessary discussions. When people are limited by time to spend on a course, this is the kind of course that is ideally looked up to. Very good course! Thank you!</em>\" - Sundararajan</p><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p><p>\"<em>Patrick is a great instructor in that he is organized, knows his stuff, and takes the time to explain everything in detail. Great course for beginning WCF developers!</em>\" - Evarardo</p><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p><p>\"<em>I like the pace, the simplicity of piece by piece introductions and the author's speaking pace &amp; clarity. very nice!</em>\" - Stephen</p><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p><p>\"<em>Love the way you go through each step one short video at a time - makes it more rewarding and easier to digest and break down if need be. Also appreciate your thorough responses to others' questions! Great job, I look forward to seeing more videos like this because I am learning a ton from you! Thank for all of your hard work and dedication!</em>\" - Adrienne</p><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p><p>\"<em>Single Page Application (SPA) has become a very important requirement for web application projects. This course has given me a very good example on how to create a \"SPA\". The whole process is covered since creating the project, the HTML page, the detailed creation of each file til its deployment. Very good. I recommend it for systems analysts who are starting to use this concept of SPA, just like me. If something in your solution does not work it's because you're doing something wrong. Everything works fine, the instructor is clear and gives us good and complete information. For me, the course was excellent.</em>\" - Michel</p><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p><p>\"<em>As always, a course by Patrick God is a good choice for learning. I had a chance to watch another courses from him and I have to say, I did the right thing choosing this guy.He is very straight forward, speak well, and let me understand quickly all what I need.</em>\" - Paulo</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Is this course right for you?</strong></p><p>This course covers creating two applications with Svelte. Most of the features are made from scratch without any dependency package. This covers -&nbsp;<strong>Form Validation, Pagination, Modal, Popups, &nbsp;Snackbar </strong>and many others. You will learn how to create everything from the ground up.</p><p>The course covers the explanation of Svelte by working on actual projects. This course will give you the confidence and skills required to start any project.</p><p><br></p><p>Students should have basic javascript knowledge to start working on this course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is Svelte?</strong></p><p>Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.</p><p>Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What are you going to work on?</strong></p><p>The first application explains base Svelte features by working on the real project - Trello clone, a simple task management application</p><p>In the second application, students will build a Twitter-like app from scratch - the HTML layout part is not part of the course (This will be provided in the course materials to save time and focus purely on &nbsp;Svelte). The focus of this course is coding and not writing HTML content.&nbsp;</p><p>The course starts with the preparation of the base layout of the application. All designs - images, and content are provided by the instructor.</p><p>Content can be briefly summarized in these points:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Layout preparation</strong>&nbsp;- A few lectures to prepare the HTML for your application. Separation of layout into the Svelte components.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Template syntax -&nbsp;</strong>Use special syntax inside of HTML</p></li><li><p><strong>Directives &amp; Events -&nbsp;</strong>Value binding of variables.</p></li><li><p><strong>Svelte Kit Routing</strong>&nbsp;- This part explains creating a \"multi-page\" application. Students will learn how to create a routing with different routing strategies and navigation to the routes.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Reactivity</strong>&nbsp;- Explains how to create and manage reactive data</p></li><li><p><strong>Lifecycle function</strong>&nbsp;- How to use&nbsp;<strong>onMount</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>onDestroy</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Stores -&nbsp;</strong>More complex reactive data</p></li><li><p><strong>Transitions</strong>&nbsp;- Fancy effects with Svelte</p></li><li><p><strong>Auth Forms</strong>&nbsp;- Students will learn how to create a reactive form and bind the data to form inputs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Custom Form Validation&nbsp;</strong>- Covers creating a custom input/form validation and error handling from scratch.</p></li><li><p><strong>Firebase/Firestore</strong>&nbsp;- Initialization of Firebase application (data storage)</p></li><li><p><strong>Store Functions</strong>&nbsp;- Important part of the projects. Allows the feature-related code to be separated into its context.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Authentication</strong>&nbsp;- This part covers creating a login, register, and logout functionality. Students will learn how to authenticate a user upon the application visit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Provider and Context</strong>&nbsp;- This creates a provider component, which can hold the data on the root level and provide them to underlying components.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Snackbars</strong>&nbsp;- App-wise functionality created with Provider to display any message as a toast popup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Glide Creation</strong>&nbsp;- Covers how to create a new glide and display it on the main page. From this point on, students will often work with Firebase/Firestore.</p></li><li><p><strong>Follow Functionality</strong>&nbsp;- Follow functionality allows users to subscribe to other users.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Display Glides from&nbsp;Following</strong>&nbsp;- Subscription (Following) to other users will allow seeing the Glides (messages) they post.</p></li><li><p><strong>Paginate Glides</strong>&nbsp;- It would be inefficient to fetch/display all of the glides on the initial load. Students will learn how to implement their lazy loaded pagination when data are loaded as the users browse the application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create Sub-Glides</strong>&nbsp;- It's essential to have a way to respond to glides. This feature enables a user to create subglides, which is an answer to the glide.</p></li><li><p><strong>Modal Messenger</strong>&nbsp;- Students will learn how to create a modal component from scratch. This will be used to display a messenger component on any page.</p></li><li><p><strong>Image Upload</strong>&nbsp;- Deployment to Firebase Storage</p></li><li><p><strong>Deployment to&nbsp;Vercel</strong>&nbsp;- Finally, the application will be live hosted on Vercel. Anybody on the internet will be able to visit your application.</p></li></ul><p>While working on the features above, the students will learn and understand Svelte features. They will know how to architecture applications and will be able to create their applications with Svelte.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course is mainly designed for the peoples who are highly interested in the web-mapping/web-GIS development. In this course, I&nbsp;mainly focused on the leaflet, JavaScript and GeoServer. Since it is a practical-based course, I directly started to write the code rather than making slides. Inside the course, you will find simple, effective, and alternative ways to do the tasks. At the end of this course, you will build a very nice geospatial data visualization portal.</p><p><strong>Leaflet: </strong>Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Weighing just about 39 KB of JS, it has all the mapping features most developers ever need. Leaflet allows developers without a GIS background to very easily display tiled web maps hosted on a public server, with optional tiled overlays. It can load feature data from GeoJSON files, style it and create interactive layers, such as markers with popups when clicked.</p><p><strong>GeoServer: </strong>GeoServer implements industry-standard OGC protocols such as Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Map Service (WMS), and Web Coverage Service (WCS). Additional formats and publication options are available as extensions including Web Processing Service (WPS), and Web Map Tile Service (WMTS). GeoServer aims to operate as a node within a free and open Spatial Data Infrastructure. Just as the Apache HTTP Server has offered a free and open webserver to publish HTML, GeoServer aims to do the same for geospatial data.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Hybrid apps are changing the way people build mobile applications. With Ionic 2, hybrid app developers are gifted with not only a fresh, well-built, and powerful platform, but also a tool to enjoy their development experience. Apps can be built in record time, yet remain visually attractive and contain advanced features.</p><p><em>Introducing Ionic 2</em>, will help you discover all the building blocks of an Ionic 2 application. You will learn how to use built-in components, make API calls, and style your app to your liking, so prepare yourself for many hours of fun development with Ionic 2.</p><p>We’ll start by bootstrapping an application, enhancing one cool feature at a time. Each feature will cover one of the essential components of an app: user experience, logic and data, and the user interface. By the end of the course, we will have built an entire awesome iTunes Browser app.</p><p>First, you’ll find out how to add pages and navigate between them, including going back and forth. Once new pages are in place, we’ll focus on grabbing real data from an API via AJAX with and without JSONP. With data and views in place, we’ll focus on improving the user experience and using modals, action sheet, alerts, loaders, and even a fully validated form. We also cover a range of various topics including styling, navigation with parameters, and Angular 2 pipes to filter and transform the way data is presented.</p><p><em>Introducing Ionic 2</em> will take you on the same journey as if you were building a real application, from scratch to a working product. You’ll soon see how this powerful mobile application framework can make your development fast, structured, and at the same time incredibly enjoyable.</p><p><strong>About The Author</strong></p><p><strong>Mathieu Chauvinc</strong> is a Managing Director at Red Ape Solutions and works on keeping the company at the bleeding edge of web technologies. On a daily basis, he leads the tech team of 15 and collaborates with them in building complex single page applications and neat hybrid mobile apps. He has been involved in web technologies for over a decade, from Django to Go, SQL to NoSQL, Mootools to Angular, continuously trying to keep the right balance between the excitement of new frameworks and the stability of proven ones. He always has a special place in his heart for Python and Django.</p><p>He holds a Master’s in Engineering from the German University Karlsruhe and a Master’s in Engineering from the French ENSAM (Paris). Despite having an engineering background, he has always had a passion for knowledge sharing, which follows him to this day, and he regularly conducts corporate or free training on various I.T. topics in his adoptive country of Malaysia.

  "description": "<p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user. Common examples of JavaScript that you might use every day include the search box on Amazon, a news recap video embedded on The New York Times, or refreshing your Twitter feed.</p><p>Incorporating JavaScript improves the user experience of the web page by converting it from a static page into an interactive one. To recap, JavaScript adds <strong>behavior</strong> to web pages.</p><p><br></p><p>What is JavaScript used for?</p><p>JavaScript is mainly used for web-based applications and web browsers. But JavaScript is also used beyond the Web in software, servers and embedded hardware controls. Here are some basic things JavaScript is used for:</p><p><br></p><p>1. Adding interactive behavior to web pages</p><p>JavaScript allows users to interact with web pages. There are almost no limits to the things you can do with JavaScript on a web page – these are just a few examples:</p><ul><li><p>Show or hide more information with the click of a button</p></li><li><p>Change the color of a button when the mouse hovers over it</p></li><li><p>Slide through a carousel of images on the homepage</p></li><li><p>Zooming in or zooming out on an image</p></li><li><p>Displaying a timer or count-down on a website</p></li><li><p>Playing audio and video in a web page</p></li><li><p>Displaying animations</p></li><li><p>Using a drop-down hamburger menu</p></li></ul><p>2. Creating web and mobile apps</p><p>Developers can use various JavaScript frameworks for developing and building web and mobile apps. JavaScript frameworks are collections of JavaScript code libraries that provide developers with pre-written code to use for routine programming features and tasks—literally a framework to build websites or web applications around.</p><p>Popular JavaScript front-end frameworks include React, React Native, Angular, and Vue. Many companies use Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript V8 engine. A few famous examples include Paypal, LinkedIn, Netflix, and Uber!</p><p>3. Building web servers and developing server applications</p><p>Beyond websites and apps, developers can also use JavaScript to build simple web servers and develop the back-end infrastructure using Node.js.</p><p>4. Game development</p><p>Of course, you can also use JavaScript to create browser games. These are a great way for beginning developers to practice their JavaScript skills.</p>",

  "description": "<p>A lot of aspiring developers and even experienced frontend developers tend to get hung up on the complex dependencies and setup requirements just to get started writing web applications. <strong>Not with this course. </strong>The first coding chapter uses no libraries at all and the rest of the course uses easy-to-use boilerplate templates for you to get started with.</p><p>This course showcases a new standard called web components, which allows us to write re-usable and framework agnostic components without the need of any tooling or libraries. You'll be able to write your own lightning fast web component powered apps or build single components to drag &amp; drop into your existing projects, independent of what framework you're using.</p><p>Web components work with Angular, React, Vue and many more frameworks out of the box. </p><p><strong>This course goes well beyond the basics of web components by teaching real-world best practices for efficiently building web apps. </strong>Whether you're a beginner or have existing experience with web development, I've made sure to pack the course full with my years of experience building products the right way. Topics include:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Web components basics:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The theory and concept behind web components and all four parts of the spec</p></li><li><p>How do define custom elements and deal with the lifecycle of a component</p></li><li><p>Managing state and rendering to the shadow DOM</p></li><li><p>Different concepts on how component communication can be managed</p></li><li><p>Introduction to new CSS pseudo selectors for web components like :host or ::slotted </p></li><li><p>Building your first app with the technologies mentioned above</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Real-world automated tests via ESLint &amp; Karma</strong></p><ul><li><p>Implementing linting vis ESLint</p></li><li><p>Setting up prettier for automatic code-formatting</p></li><li><p>Unit and integration testing via Karma </p></li><li><p>Setting up Istanbul for code coverage reports</p></li><li><p>Setting up CircleCI for Continuous Integration, so tests run with every push to your repo</p></li><li><p>Setting up slack notifications for failed and fixed tests </p></li><li><p>Adding CI badges to your repos to highlight the status of your tests</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>After taking this course, you’ll have a solid foundation in the fundamentals of the web components standard, and will be confident enough to build production grade apps powered by web components.</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>C# RestFul Web API on .Net Core Web API with using Postman and in Real Project with MsSQL and Entity Framework Core(EF Core)<br></strong><br>Hello, </p><p>Welcome to<strong> C# RESTFUL API on Web API .Net Core with MsSQL &amp; EF Core.</strong></p><p><strong>C# RestFul Web API on .Net Core Web API with using Postman and in Real Project with MsSQL and Entity Framework Core(EF Core)</strong></p><p>Finally, our<strong> Web API</strong> course is ready for you. A lot of students want an API course to use API projects on .Net Core.</p><p>Before starting, I want to explain that this course is a part of big training. I can tell this part is the most important part that we will use in following training in an online ticket project, a web project,&nbsp; and in all mobile versions as well made in Xamarin, Flutter, Java Android, Angular, Node.js, React Native, and Vue Native. For developers who have no knowledge about the API, I preferred to explain the basics of the API in this section basically. However, in the following sections, we will learn to use <strong>JSON web tokens</strong> and we will apply JSON Web Token in more complex projects.</p><p>This course will give you everything that you will need to start Web API project’s on .Net Core. Before starting this course, you should know that you need to have basic C# knowledge. With this course, you will learn API concepts with .Net core and you will make more practice on C# programming. And as you know with C# programming you may use Xamarin Forms to build cross-platform mobile apps or design a new video game in Unity.</p><p>We will start our training with answers to what the Web API is. Then we will examine the most useful concepts as <strong>Rest and SOAP</strong>. We will learn the differences between <strong>SOAP and RESTFul</strong>.</p><p>In .Net core programming, EF core is very important to make crud SQL operations. In this course, you will learn to <strong>use EF Core</strong> with code first approach on a project that you can use in any project.</p><p>After<strong> EF core,</strong> you will meet HTTP concepts or you will get more information about HTTP Concepts. For example, you will learn the meaning of <strong>HTTP status code</strong> that you may always see in any project like<strong> 404 status code</strong> as not found. In this course, you can find all necessary information about the crud operation of API with HTTP methods as Get. Post, Put, Delete, or Patch.</p><p><strong>Postman </strong>is one of the most popular software testing tools which is used for API testing. With the help of this tool, developers can easily create, test, share, and document APIs. And in my opinion, if you work on APIs, the postman is the best app for you. This means in this course you can also <strong>learn using Postman</strong>.</p><p>In most training trainers prefer to show API results only with the postman. But in this course, you will also learn to <strong>consume an API.</strong> This explanation may be too complicated for you. Simply, in this course first, we will create an API project as Back-End. After that, we will create another project in which we will consume our source as Front-End. As you know .net framework works only on windows platforms but .net core is a cross-platform framework which means with .Net core you may use the other platforms. This means you can share your API with any projects on any platform.</p><p>In this training, you can also learn to use any API to consume like news API to get global news to your project. And in any project, you may see that login with Facebook or Google. This means you can learn facebook or google authentication. Also, we will learn to consume API projects in a WPF core project.</p><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching. </p><p><strong>OAK Academy</strong> based in <strong>London</strong> is an online <strong>education company</strong>. OAK Academy gives education in the field of I<strong>T, Software, Design, development</strong> in <strong>English, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish,</strong> and a lot of different languages on the Udemy platform where it has over <strong>1500+ hours</strong> of video education lessons. OAK Academy both increase its education series number by publishing new courses, and it makes students aware of all the innovations of already published courses by upgrading.</p><p>When you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned developers' expertise.&nbsp;Questions sent by students to our instructors are answered by our instructors within <strong>48 hours at the latest</strong>.</p><p><strong>What is C#?</strong></p><p>C# (pronounced see-sharp) is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. It was designed as a multi-paradigm programming language by Microsoft in around 2000 as part of its .NET initiative. The .NET framework and .NET applications are multi-platform applications that you can use with programming languages such as C++, C#, Visual Basic, and COBOL. C# is open-source and was designed to be simple yet modern, flexible yet powerful, and versatile yet easy to learn and program with. Many programming languages in the past were designed for specific purposes. C# was developed with business and enterprise needs in mind. By providing functionality to support modern-day software development such as web applications, mobile, and response app needs, C# supports many features of modern-day programming languages. That includes generics, var types, dynamic programming, asynchronous programming, pattern matching, advanced debugging, and exception handling, to name a few.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of C# over C++?</strong></p><p>Thanks to the .NET framework, C# has many advantages over C++. C# is a refined and modernized version of C++. C++ was developed to bring object-orientation to C, an older but widely used language, and C++ became the de-facto language for building applications for Windows as well as infrastructure and low-level applications. Visual Basic was for business applications. What C# does is combine the rapid development capabilities of VB with the power of C++. C# also has many new data types, type-safety, to ensure you do not unknowingly reuse initialized variables. It uses a simplified syntax, a huge improvement over the complex coding often required in C++. C# also removes memory management issues thanks to . NET’s garbage collection scheme. You do not have to reference items for garbage collection; the system can reclaim that memory as required. Finally, you can use C# to interoperate with other languages on the .NET platform, a huge benefit in terms of system interoperability.</p><p><strong>Why use encapsulation in C#?</strong></p><p>Encapsulation can be used in C# to hide data and program behavior from users. With encapsulation, you can group properties, methods, and other members so that they are treated as a single object. It is a means to prevent the user of a given class from manipulating program objects in ways that were not intended by the designer or developer. Encapsulation hides how a program operates without affecting how it works while still allowing users to service requests for functionality and add or modify internal data or methods to meet changing needs. For example, suppose you have an object called “Patient” that contains patient-related data. In that case, you can use encapsulation to provision patient-specific data to those who need it without exposing all patient data. In addition to information hiding, you can use encapsulation in C# to improve your code's reusability, and it also makes it easier to perform unit testing.</p><p><strong>What is C# used for?</strong></p><p>C# is a general-purpose programming language that you can use to build a wide range of programs and applications, such as web applications, Windows applications and game development. In web application development, you can build dynamic websites and apps using .NET or another open-source platform of your choice. Also, since Microsoft created C# for Microsoft, C# is a popular language for building Windows applications. There are rich resources and a vibrant C# community that can support and documentation for applications and programs specific to Microsoft platform architectures, making it easier than ever to develop applications in this space. Finally, C# is a popular language to use in game-building, especially with Unity, a game engine that runs on C++ and C#.</p><p><strong>What is a constructor? What is a destructor?</strong></p><p>To understand constructors and destructors, we need to understand methods. A method is a block of code that contains a series of statements. Programs run by executing methods. A constructor is a special method of a class that is automatically called whenever an instance of a given class is created. A constructor contains the instructions that execute when an object is created. Developers use it to assign specific initial values to the data members of the same class. In C#, you will get a compile-time error if you try to read from an uninitialized variable. You must first initialize your variables by giving them an initial value, which is what the constructor does. On the other hand, destructors are methods used to destroy instances of a class when they are no longer needed. Destructors are called implicitly by the garbage collector in .NET, and as a developer, you have no control regarding when to call the destructor.</p><p><strong>How do I learn C#?</strong></p><p>As is true for many skills, you can learn C# by taking Udemy courses, reading documentation, and practicing coding hands-on. There are many resources available for all of the above, including real-time compiler applications that will show you the output of your code as you type it. However, it is best to plan ahead, and you should have an outline of what you need to learn before beginning your journey. The first thing to learn about is what C# is, how and where it is used, and why it was developed. From there, you can learn about data types, variables, keywords, and functions. Once you’ve grasped the basics, you can move on to learning about conditional tests and operators, functions, arguments, object orientation, arrays, strings, classes, methods, structs, debugging, and exception handling.</p><p><strong>What is SQL Server?</strong></p><p>SQL Server is a relational database management system or RDBMS created and developed by Microsoft. Designed to store and retrieve data for other software applications using the client-server model-- these applications connect to SQL Server through a network or the Internet with multiple applications using the same data. One SQL Server instance can also manage one or more relational databases. Relational databases store data in tables that can relate to each other. For example, data for business customers get stored in one table relating to another table that stores orders. Applications that connect to Microsoft SQL Server retrieve, store, and delete data using Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL Server is available for Windows and Linux.</p><p><strong>What is SQL Server Management Studio?</strong></p><p>SQL Server Management Studio is desktop software designed to connect to Microsoft relational database management systems, including Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Synapse Analytics. SQL Server Management Studio is an integrated database development tool that database architects, database developers, and software engineers can use to access, configure, manage, administer, and develop databases on any one of these database systems. It simplifies database management by providing graphical design tools and rich script editors that allow database developers to visualize an entire database or multiple databases from a single application. SQL Server Management Studio only runs on the Microsoft Windows operating system but can connect to database instances running on either Windows or Linux.</p><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong></p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching.</p><p>When you enroll, you will feel our seasoned developers' expertise.</p><p><strong>No prior knowledge is needed!</strong></p><p>It doesn't need any prior knowledge to learn it and it is easy to understand for beginners.</p><p>This course starts with the very basics. First, you will learn how to install the tools, some terminology.

  "description": "<p>XML stands for extensible markup language used to store and transport data. It was created to make it easier to share information across multiple platforms.</p><p>In this beginner's course you will learn the basics from creating XML syntax to a full XML document structure.<br>XML is a popular data exchange format used in a variety of places like web development, Databases and legacy systems. XML in a way acts as a bridge <br>in data exchange or interpretation.  If you have data in say a very old legacy system that you want to transfer or make available in a more<br>modern system you can use XML to translate the data so both systems can talk to each other. XML unlike HTML allows you to define your own tags thus giving you the freedom and flexibility to design your document<br>structure to suit your purpose. If you have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS XML will be easier to learn but the course is also easy and basic enough to learn.</p>\n\nThe lectures in this course include:<br><ul><li>What is XML</li><li>syntax</li><li>Root Element</li><li>Custom Tags</li><li>Nested Elements</li><li>XML Document Structure</li><li>XML Comments</li></ul>\n\n<p>This is a video based course and designed with the absolute beginner in mind. By the end of this course you will be able to create your very own basic XML document with custom tags and elements.<br>I look forward to welcoming you to the course.</p>\n\n<p>Thank You</p>",

  "description": "<p><em>Have you ever wondered why your competitors outrank you on the search engines when your content is so much better? Ever&nbsp; questioned why your website loads so slowly when your competitors load in a blink of an eye?</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Finally, my WordPress Speed Optimization Blueprint course is here! This is where I will show you how you can make your website load in the blink of an eye so you can outperform your biggest competitors and rank higher on the search engines!</strong></p><p><em>(This course was requested by more than 1,000 of my students)</em></p><p><br></p><p>Master all of my personal tips, tricks &amp; techniques I have been tweaking, improving and optimising for the past 15 years, so that you can uncover the same kind of crazy-fast page load speeds &amp; Google Lighthouse Scores I have been delivering for clients for years. </p><p><br></p><p>So, why are page loading times so important? Below are some fun facts from a 2022 survey;</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong><em>Google's Revelation:</em></strong><em> A 500ms (half-second) slowdown chops down their ad revenue by 20%. Quick and impactful!</em></p></li><li><p><strong><em>Amazon's Discovery:</em></strong><em> A barely-there 100ms delay (one-tenth of a second) shaves off 1% of their revenue. Every millisecond counts!</em></p></li><li><p><strong><em>Yahoo's Triumph:</em></strong><em> Improving their load time by just 400ms led to a 9% surge in traffic. Speed does wonders!</em></p></li><li><p><strong><em>User Preference:</em></strong><em> 27% admit they'd skip to a competitor if a site drags its feet. Loyalty has its limits!</em></p></li><li><p><strong><em>Google's Speed Crusade:</em></strong><em> They're so gung-ho about speed and user experience, that they're testing a \"SLOW\" label in search results for the tortoises of the web world. Speed is king!</em></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Not only do page loading times impact on user experience but also your ability to rank high on the search engine results pages. Since Google has confirmed that page loading times and user experience are now a ranking factor, there has never been a more important time to ensure your website pages load with lightning-fast speeds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Just some of the things you will learn from this course are;</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Fundamentals of Page Speed and how this is measured</p></li><li><p>Master Google's Page Page Insights (PSI) tool and how to troubleshoot your reports</p></li><li><p>Master Google's Core Web Vitals and create changes that positively impact your user experience and ranking potential</p></li><li><p>Learn the very best hosting companies I use for the fastest speeds for hundreds of mine and my client's websites</p></li><li><p>Leverage the 3 main types of web cache and save resources, costs and catapult your website performance</p></li><li><p>Identify and fix render-blocking resources</p></li><li><p>Resolve modification and contamination issues</p></li><li><p>Fine-tune your JS, CSS &amp; HTML page optimizations and squeeze every single millisecond from your page loading times</p></li><li><p>Master image optimizations, lazy loading and preloading</p></li><li><p>Learn the skills to troubleshoot and resolve key web vital issues such as Largest Contentful Paint &amp; Cumulative Layout Shift</p></li></ul><p>My name is Ricky Wallace, and I have been building websites for clients for over 15 years. With every website I build, I offer a side service for $350 to optimise their website for speed. If you are a WordPress developer, or even aspiring to be one, then this course will show you how you can add additional $ onto every new client and bring in an additional stream of revenue on top of your standard services.</p><p><br></p><p>And even if you do not want to make a business out of this, you will still learn how you can apply these speed optimisations to all of your own personal and business websites so that they perform better and rank higher than every single one of your competitors.</p><p><br></p><p>Ready to get started? </p><p>See you on the inside :)</p><p>Ricky</p>",

How do I know this? Because I’ve been leading tech teams in both large enterprise as well as startup companies in New York City for the past 15 years.</p><p>I have seen a lot of courses and  free tutorials and I can tell you 90% of them just teach bad habits while promising to turn you into a real “web developer”.</p><p><strong>This course doesn’t promise to turn you into a professional back end developer after you complete it</strong> -- it takes much more than the 4 hours of of this course (and probably hundreds of hours of self-practicing) to do that, <strong>but it will give you a solid foundation from where to start and continue your training</strong>, knowing the right path to become a real professional backend web applications developer using Python.</p><p>The course goes through a step by step process of setting up your environment, introducing Flask. It then moves to explore SQL databases, using MySQL and finally showing you how to develop a blogging application using all these learnings.</p><p><strong>Best of all, you don’t need to own a computer to take this course, if you don’t own one</strong>. You can complete this course from an internet or cyber cafe, <strong>as we teach how to to use both locally installed files or an online coding platform</strong>.</p><p>At the end of the course students will be challenged with a final project where all the course material will need to be used to complete it. Students that finish the final project will be eligible for special future promotions.</p><p>If you are interested in learning how to code from zero and without prior knowledge, but do it using best industry practices towards becoming a professional backend web developer, this is the course for you.</p><p>The course is divided in 7 sections:</p><ul><li><p>Introduction</p></li><li><p>Your Development Environment</p></li><li><p>Say Hello World</p></li><li><p>Setting up our Database</p></li><li><p>A Visitor Counter</p></li><li><p>Flogger: A Personal Blog Application</p></li><li><p>Final Project</p></li></ul><p>The course has more than 4 hours of video tutorials as well as the source code of all the lessons, so that you can see exactly what the whole project looks like in each stage.</p><p>The course can take anywhere from 7 days to a month to complete based on how much material the student completes daily.</p><p>Additionally we’re constantly updating the course, adding contents thanks to the feedback of our students.</p><p><strong>So stop looking around and start the right path to becoming a professional Python backend web developer with this course!</strong></p>",

It is really easy to learn Node JS. That is being said, no prior knowledge or experience is required. At the end of this course, you will get the basics of Node JS.</p><p>In this course, we'll look at how the C++ written V8 Javascript engine works and how NodeJS uses it to expand the abilities of Javascript.</p><p>Node.js is essential to developing real-time applications in JavaScript and has been instrumental in the development of websites like eBay and PayPal. Node is designed around an event loop, which allows for easy management of asynchronous functions. This makes it a popular environment for modern developers working on chat and gaming apps.</p><p><strong>In this course;</strong></p><p>You'll learn how asynchronous code works in Node and the Node event loop, as well as how to use the event emitter, streams, buffers, pipes, and work with files. We'll see how that leads to building a web server in Node with hands-on examples. <br>With my Node JS course, you will learn rapidly growing web server technology, and become a Node developer which is among the highest-paid in the industry.</p><p><strong>What is Node.Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications. It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time. By using JavaScript, node.Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript. Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux). Node.js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast. Examples of applications that use node.Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node.Js?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is open-source, meaning it’s a free code for all developers. On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node.Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base. Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node.Js environment continues to be enhanced. Because Node.Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment. It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training. Node.Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node.Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs. It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run). Node.Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required. Because Node.Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs. The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time. It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies.</p><p><strong>What is microservices architecture and how can Node.Js be used for it?</strong></p><p>Microservices architecture is a software development style or method where single-function modules originate. Each has a very well-defined operation and interface and can deploy on its own. In essence, it’s a way of developing modules that you can repurpose from one program or application to another. When you create an application, it’s a collection of modules that have been thoroughly tested and are well-maintained. The modules are typically built around different business-specific capabilities and are then loosely coupled to other modules when deployed as part of a program. You can use Node.Js in microservices architecture as the language of choice for one, some, or all of the microservices (or modules). The beauty of microservices is that you can use the best language for the specific microservice. But where highly scalable, fast programs are needed, Node.Js would be a top contender.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now <strong>NodeJS For Beginners </strong>course</p><p>We offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the \" <strong>PHP AJAX BOOTCAMP </strong>\" course. The first question that comes to mind what is AJAX?&nbsp;AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML, using AJAX we can read data from an API when the page has loaded, and we can update the backend without page reloading. And we can send data to the backend without page reloading. So these are the cool features of AJAX. So in this course, we will learn everything about AJAX and Object-Oriented Programming, once we learn the basics of AJAX and Object-Oriented Programing afterward we will create a modern-looking project using AJAX and Object-Oriented Programming. In the project, we will have authentication and books store application besides that we will have a gallery project as well, in the gallery application, we upload images with AJAX, and after we access images from the database. </p><p><strong><em>Why should I take the course?</em></strong></p><p>Because in this course you will learn Object-Oriented Programming from scratch, and after we will create a project with Object-Oriented Programming as well besides that you will also learn modern CSS. </p><p><strong>Support:</strong></p><p>If you have any issue regarding the course you can ask the question in the QA section. </p><ul><li><p>Object oriented programming</p></li><li><p>PDO Basics</p></li><li><p>JSON Basics </p></li><li><p>AJAX Basics</p></li><li><p>CRUD Application using AJAX &amp; PHP</p></li><li><p>AJAX images gallery application using AJAX &amp; PHP</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p><strong>GraphQL</strong> is a new API standard that provides a more efficient, robust and flexible alternative to<strong> REST</strong>. It was developed and open-sourced by Facebook and is now maintained by a large community of companies and individuals from all over the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>APIs</strong> have become ubiquitous components of software infrastructures. In short, an<strong> API </strong>defines how a<strong>client</strong> can load data from a server.</p>\n\n<p>At its core,<strong> GraphQL</strong> enables declarative data fetching where a client can specify exactly what data it needs from an API. Instead of <strong>multiple endpoints</strong> that return fixed data structures, a<strong> GraphQL</strong> server only exposes a single endpoint and responds with precisely the data a client asked for.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How GraphQL is better than REST</strong></p>\n\n<p>1.<strong> Increased mobile usage creates need for efficient data loading</strong>\nIncreased mobile usage, low-powered devices and sloppy networks were the initial reasons why Facebook developed GraphQL. GraphQL minimizes the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network and thus majorly improves applications operating under these conditions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Variety of different frontend frameworks and platforms</strong>\nThe heterogeneous landscape of frontend frameworks and platforms that run client applications makes it difficult to build and maintain one API that would fit the requirements of all. With GraphQL, each client can access precisely the data it needs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Fast development &amp; expectation for rapid feature development</strong>\nContinuous deployment has become a standard for many companies, rapid iterations and frequent product updates are indispensable. With REST APIs, the way data is exposed by the server often needs to be modified to account for specific requirements and design changes on the client-side. This hinders fast development practices and product iterations.</p><p><strong>What you will learn?</strong></p>\n\n<p> This course will cover these following topics</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Getting Started with GraphQL and NodeJs</strong></li><li><strong>CURD Operations with GraphQL, NodeJs, and MongoDB</strong></li><li><strong>Authentication and Authorization in GraphQL, NodeJs and MongoDB</strong></li><li><strong>Pagination, Filtering, And Sorting in GraphQL</strong></li><li><strong>Fragments, Interfaces, and Unions in GraphQL</strong></li><li><strong>Subscriptions and Data Loaders in GraphQL</strong></li><li><strong>Caching and Batching in GraphQL</strong></li><li><strong>Testing with Jest in GraphQL and NodeJs</strong></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>In this course, we will create a new project like online-book-shopping.</p><p><br></p><p>When I say online-book-shopping application, we can think of it like that we will have a book-list page. Somehow users or customers will see these book-lists and they can buy one of them. Of course, at the end of it, this purchase will be stored and displayed later.</p><p><br></p><p>And we will implement this project using Spring Boot, Angular, and PostgreSQL.</p><p><br></p><p>In our project, we will implement CRUD operations. These CRUD operations will be for users and books. We will use users for user sign-in, sign-up and authorization operations. And we will use the books for creating, editing, deleting book operations.</p><p><br></p><p>These CRUD operations will be requested from Angular. So on the backend, we will create an infrastructure for these CRUD operations and on the frontend, we will serve them with the user interface.</p><p><br></p><p>Our project goes on with User and book operations.</p><p>Our main operations will be user login, register, book-list, create-book, delete-book etc.</p><p>Also, we will go on with the role based application. So we will use different roles like “Admin”, “User”. Then we will provide different authorizations to these users according to the role.</p><p>And this all things will be provided with a secure way in both Angular and Spring Boot.</p><p><br></p><p>We will have two main components to implement our project.</p><p>These are server side and client side.</p><p><br></p><p>In Server Side:</p><p><br></p><p>Of course here, our main library will be Spring-boot. We will implement the whole infrastructure on the backend with the Spring boot. It will provide easy and fast configuration to us.</p><p><br></p><p>We will implement the Model view controller architecture on our project.</p><p><br></p><p>Spring-security will be one of the main topics in our application. Also, we will use JWT to provide security.</p><p><br></p><p>In Spring Boot, Data will be presented to the client as an API call so Spring Rest Controller will be used to handle it.</p><p><br></p><p>We will use PostgreSQL as Database. We can use other databases also but at the end of it we will deploy our codes to Heroku. Postgresql can be used on Heroku for free so we chose that.</p><p><br></p><p>We will also use Object Relational Mapping with Java Persistence API and Hibernate.</p><p><br></p><p>You know, We can map our database tables to objects with hibernate.</p><p><br></p><p>We will use JPA Repository and Crud Repository in Spring Boot.</p><p>So these repository templates will handle common database operations like save, update, find, delete.</p><p><br></p><p>With Spring Boot, we will also use Lombok library to clear code.</p><p>You know that we don't want to implement getter, setter, equals and hash code. So we can escape it using Lombok @Data or @Value annotation.</p><p><br></p><p>We will use Gradle To handle all dependencies on server side.</p><p><br></p><p>For our all services, we will create cloud deployment with Heroku. Heroku is an amazing free framework. We can deploy our spring-boot projects with some configuration over github easily. So At the end of the course, we will have an application on production and we will have a code on github that is accessible by everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>That's all about Server side.</p><p><br></p><p>Let's talk about Client Side.</p><p><br></p><p>We will create an angular application on the client side and it will provide a cool user-interface. So we will create some pages like home-page, admin dashboard, login page and register-page. Then we will assign the server apis to these pages and we will consume and produce the data from the user-interface easily and user friendly.</p><p><br></p><p>On angular, we will also implement the model view controller architecture. We will use the cool features of typescript etc.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of it, we will build it and we will serve it to heroku also. So at the end of the course, we will have a live application on production.</p><p><br></p><p>Last but not least, we will implement security and authorization on angular also. We will work with different roles and according to these roles, we will implement unauthorized and not-found pages on the user interface also.</p><p><br></p><p>We will see the details of them one by one.</p>",

Let’s explore creative coding and discover what can be done by combining different drawing and animation techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledge is power. That’s why we will use just basic programming principles—functions, arrays, and for-loops—and plain <strong>vanilla JavaScript</strong>, no frameworks and no libraries. I will explain every line of code as we create multiple animated projects. Being able to fully understand how the code works will allow us to gain complete control over the code, and we can make it do whatever we want it to.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me show you how to draw a simple line, animate it, and then turn it into more and more complex effects as we add more techniques to our <strong>creative coding toolkit</strong>, one by one. </p><p><br></p><p>Discover the secrets of creative coding today. The biggest secret is that it’s actually much easier than you think to <strong>create complex, beautiful animations</strong>. You just have to take it step by step. Everything makes sense if you break the process down into individual parts.</p><p><br></p><p>Section 1:</p><p>In the first beginner-friendly block, we will learn <em>how to draw shapes on canvas and how to animate them</em>, turning them into animated spirals, rainbow lightning bolts, and random scribbles.</p><p><br></p><p>Sections 2, 3, and 4</p><p>If you already understand the basics of drawing on an HTML canvas, you can skip directly to Section 2, where I start the main course project from scratch. We will <em>create an animated flow field, experiment with it, and make it bend around text and images</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>Have fun!</p>",

  "description": "<p>In this Creating Plugins to Extend WordPress training course, expert author Joe Chellman will teach you how to create your own plugins using the WordPress API. This course is designed for users that already have a basic working knowledge of WordPress. </p>\n\n<p>You will start by learning about the highlights of the WordPress API, then jump into creating your first plugin: a dashboard banner. From there, Joe will teach you how to create your second plugin, as well as how to further enhance your plugin, including how to create a widget for custom posts, register settings and sections, and prepare your plugin for localization. This video tutorial also covers additional plugin possibilities, such as using transients to cache expensive operations, implementing the transients API, and reacting to deactivation and uninstallation of your plugin. Finally, you will learn how to distribute your plugin, including how to publish independently on GitHub and submit to the WordPress plugin directory. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have completed this computer based training course, you will have learned how to create and distribute your own plugins using PHP and the WordPress API. Working files are included, allowing you to follow along with the author throughout the lessons.</p>",

A CRUD application is basically a database application which performs basic operations like Create/Insert(C),Read(R), Update(U), Delete(D). It also <strong>has a project at the end</strong> which is a <strong>Product Management System</strong>. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This project has the following functionalities:-\n\n  </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Login/Logout\n\n  </li><li>View Products\n\n  </li><li>Add Product\n\n  </li><li>Edit Product\n\n  </li><li>Delete Product\n\n  </li><li>Search Product\n\n  </li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The above project is explained line by line in the video lectures and the source code will available for students to download.(Check Conclusion and Source Code section)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Some of the key points regarding this course:-</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Total hands-on programming experience.\n\n  </li><li>JSP programming examples explained.\n\n  </li><li>Basic JDBC concepts covered.\n\n  </li><li>Project: Product Management System\n\n  </li><li>Requires 2-3 hours of your time.\n\n  </li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As it’s a short course, it won’t be boring at all. You need to<strong> invest only around 2-3 hours of your time</strong>. I believe you will enjoy this course and learn a lot. Happy Coding :) \n\n</p>",

This course is designed to simplify the process and walk you through how to do it step by step.</p><p>Learn how to authenticate users with email, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Github. Users will also be able to reset their passwords or delete their accounts.</p><p>After authenticating we will build a \"to-do list\" application that demonstrates how to store data related to the user. This is commonly referred to as authorization. In this app, the user will be able to save tasks for themselves and also view or mark them as complete.</p><p>While learning authentication we also extend the app so you end up getting experience with a lot of the Firebase services. For instance, this course uses Firebase Storage for profile uploading, the Realtime Database for to-do list items and Firebase Hosting&nbsp;for a fully deployed live site.</p><p>Firebase is hands down the fastest way to create full-stack applications in 2019. Firebase is a suite of cloud services backed by Google that allows you to launch applications extremely quickly. Because it's a BaaS (Backend as a Service) you get all the benefits of a backend without the complications of setting one up. Firebase's services are 100% free until you reach a monthly data cap. It's meant to be enough for testing full-stack apps on the platform but it's enough to run your site live for FREE (if your app is in its beginning stages - upgrade if needed). This guide assumes you have some JavaScript knowledge but absolutely zero knowledge of Firebase.</p><p><br></p>",

applications</strong></p><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong></p><p><strong>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching</strong></p><p><strong>OAK Academy based in London is an online education company OAK Academy gives education in the field of IT, Software, Design, development in English, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish and a lot of different language on Udemy platform where it has over 1000 hours of video education lessons OAK Academy both increase its education series number by publishing new courses, and it makes students aware of all the innovations of already published courses by upgrading</strong></p><p><strong>When you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned developers expertise Questions sent by students to our instructors are answered by our instructors within 48 hours at the latest</strong></p><p><strong><em>Fresh Content</em></strong></p><p><strong>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate New tools are released every day, and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge for being a better React developer You will always have up-to-date content for this course at no extra charge</strong></p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p><strong>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM) These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications</strong></p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p><strong>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML React Native uses React to build mobile applications Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware</strong></p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p><strong>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places</strong></p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p><strong>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application With this in mind, React is a library It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built</strong></p><p><strong>What is React Native?</strong></p><p><strong>Created by Facebook, React Native is an open-source-based mobile application framework that uses only JavaScript, making it capable of supporting both Android and iOS platforms React, also known as React js, saves time and effort for developers since they only need one programming language The Native element allows developers to create JavaScript components to design software programs that run on various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, smart TVs, and laptops With React Native, developers use the same concepts used in the original React framework to design a rich mobile user interface (UI) for various environments from existing components</strong></p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p><strong>Yes, React is worth learning There are a couple of reasons The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job This alone is another reason it is worth learning Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework</strong></p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p><strong>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp</strong></p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p><strong>React, or React JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different In React, web components are generated In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs If your focus is web development, then you should learn React If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native</strong></p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p><strong>There are many reasons why React is popular One reason is that Facebook developed it The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs) React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements</strong></p><p><strong>What is Node Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p><strong>Node Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time By using JavaScript, node Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux) Node js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast Examples of applications that use node Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming</strong></p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node Js?</strong></p><p><strong>Node Js is open-source, meaning it’s a free code for all developers On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node Js environment continues to be enhanced Because Node Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training Node Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable</strong></p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p><strong>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run) Node Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required Because Node Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies</strong></p><p><strong>What is microservices architecture and how can Node Js be used for it?</strong></p><p><strong>Microservices architecture is a software development style or method where single-function modules originate Each has a very well-defined operation and interface and can deploy on its own In essence, it’s a way of developing modules that you can repurpose from one program or application to another When you create an application, it’s a collection of modules that have been thoroughly tested and are well-maintained The modules are typically built around different business-specific capabilities and are then loosely coupled to other modules when deployed as part of a program You can use Node Js in microservices architecture as the language of choice for one, some, or all of the microservices (or modules) The beauty of microservices is that you can use the best language for the specific microservice But where highly scalable, fast programs are needed, Node Js would be a top contender</strong></p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p><strong>All our content is created/produced as high-quality video/audio to provide you the best

  "description": "<p>  \t                                Content Management Systems (CMS&#039;s) help you create and manage your website on-line. This course will guide you through using <strong>MODX </strong>to build and maintain your website with <strong>total creative freedom</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t              Why does MODX win out over other CMS&#039;s? Too often they get in the way. You want to add something but you have to add it as a &quot;widget&quot; or a &quot;block&quot;. You want to change the layout of your site but you don&#039;t have access to the code. MODX<strong> </strong>changes all that, you have total control over the code.  </p>  <p>  \t                You may be familiar with <strong>Drupal</strong>, <strong>Joomla</strong> and <strong>Wordpress, </strong>while these are good at what they do, they all have their limitations. <strong>MODX </strong>is different, you are unrestrained, you can design your website exactly how you want, to look like you want it to look and do what you want it to do.  </p>  <p>  \t                                 This course introduces you to the basic concepts of the MODX content management system<strong> </strong>so you can get up and running with a website that is totally under your control in no time at all. You will learn:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>how to download MODX</li>  \t<li>how to host MODX</li>  \t<li>how to create the required database </li>  \t<li>how to install MODX</li>  \t<li>what are the key concepts for using MODX</li>  \t<li>finding and using a free website theme</li>  \t<li>adapting a theme to your requirements</li>  \t<li>collecting data from your users</li>  \t<li>how to implement search engine optimisation best practices</li>  \t<li>how to set up Google Analytics and Webmaster Tools to help optimise your site</li>  \t<li>how to make your website social media friendly</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t  The objectives are to:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>Use MODX with power, ease, and flexibility</li>  \t<li>Build an attractive, functional, and responsive website step-by-step with MODX.</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t  MODX is an <strong>open source CMS </strong>software<strong> </strong>project which means it has been developed by a community of programmers around the world and is given away for <strong>free</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t  The course is made up of <strong>step-by-step video lessons</strong> in which a responsive website is built using the MODX system and a free template.  </p>  <p>  \t                                A basic understanding of HTML and CSS is all that is required to discover the power of MODX.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>You can learn all you need to know to start using MODX in just two and a half hours.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                You should take this course if:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>You have just completed one of the many HTML and CSS courses and want to check out the different CMS options open to you.</li>  </ul>  <ul>  \t<li>You use another content management system such as Joomla, Drupal or Wordpress and you want to compare it to MODX.</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t                            The instructor will be available to answer any questions you have during the course.  </p>",

  "description": "<p>This course will not only teach you the basics about bots, it will also show you how to make your own bot using NO CODE on the Microsoft Bot Framework.  </p>\n\n<p>Bots are becoming more ubiquitous to our daily internet lives.  There is hardly a place you can go online without interacting with a bot, whether you knew it or not. And there are different types of bots who do various kinds of things. From indexing web pages to finding information even to book airplane flights.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To this point, bots were usually created by programmers. And the cost to make them was high.  The everyday person could not use them for their purposes.  With this course, you will learn about the different types of bots, why they exist, along with what they do. All in a very easy to understand (no techspeak, I promise) format with lectures, demonstrations, and step-by-step instructions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will use the Microsoft Bot Framework to build our very own bot. And we will connect the bot to the outside world through SMS text messaging.  So, you will be able to share your bot with other people! This course will also give you some ideas and examples of other types of bots that you may wish to create afterward.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking to learn about bots, build a bot or see examples of bots working on the internet, then this course is for you.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong><em>Note: this is a backend PHP course for WordPress</em></strong></p><p>**********************************************************</p><p>Welcome to WordPress advanced Theme development with ACF and ACF PRO. Many courses are pretending that they teach you everything you need to know about WordPress Theme creation.

I will convert by the end of this course a fully HTML CSS bootstrap template into a functional WordPress theme.</p><p><br></p><p>So most of you ask this question: what I can get from this course.</p><p>Well the answer is :</p><p>You will be able to convert any bootstrap template to a fully functional WordPress theme using various technologies such as Custom post types and advanced custom fields.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>what we will cover in this course?</strong></p><p>We will have a good knowledge of how to enqueue styles and JS scripts the right way.

We will see also how to create widgets for the blog single page and in the footer of the theme, comments for both blogs pages. Finally, we will make our code clean with the standards of web security \"Data Sanitization \", we will create the famous child theme and we will create a simple plugin for our custom post types. And last but not least we will know how to use TGM to bundle all our plugins into the Demo importer which we will implement with the aid of the One-click demo importer plugin.</p><p><strong>What exactly are you going to learn?</strong></p><p>We will start with the basics. You'll learn how to install WordPress the right way. And that's something not everyone knows how to do (trust me!). And, step by step, we will dive into more interesting topics.</p><p>You'll learn things like:</p><ul><li><p>How the basic structure of the theme works - from scratch</p></li><li><p>How to integrate the theme with Bootstrap - any version</p></li><li><p>Inner template files and essential WordPress pages</p></li><li><p>Native functions and tools that bring the entire mechanism of the theme to life</p></li></ul><p>And much more... You'll also learn how to handle some specialized tools and APIs, like:</p><ul><li><p>ACF and custom post types in general, you will create your CPT and make them editable with advanced custom fields ACF and ACF pro.</p></li><li><p>The powerful TGM Plugin Activation library. If you intend to redistribute your work, TGM will help you package all your plugins with the theme</p></li><li><p>And finally, you'll also learn how to make A one demo importer and a simple plugin for all your CPT \"custom post types\"</p></li></ul><p>We will provide the initial HTML and CSS template that we will convert step by step and of course the final project or theme in the resources.<br></p><p><strong>How is the course different?</strong></p><p>The course’s uniqueness is its versatility in its benefits.

See the linked video for a primer information.</em></p><p><strong>Integrating CSS and JS Files with Razor Pages</strong></p><p><em>This is a quick and complete explanation of how to integrate your razor pages to a&nbsp; framework such as bootstrap, and how to add and manage your custom CSS, JS and image files in your application. We explain various files such as the _ViewStart file, the _Layout file, and the special directory wwwroot. The concept is similar to that of master pages in the classic ASP.NET. The article also contains a linked video that you can watch for a clearer understanding of how we have integrated bootstrap to a simplest ASP.NET Core application.</em></p><p><strong>Inter Page Navigation and Linking of Razor Pages with Anchor Tag Helpers</strong></p><p><em>Tag helpers provide a standard way of generating html tags in razor pages. They are interpreted on server side. They are of the same syntax as html tags, so a web-designer can style and script them as he does any other html tag. Razor pages are not enabled for tag helpers by default. In this tutorial we learn how to enable a razor page for tag helpers, and we also learn a walkthrough on using the most common \"anchor tag helper\" to navigate from one razor page to another.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞EXERCISES&nbsp;ON Ch1 - RAZOR&nbsp;PAGES</strong></p><p><strong>Exercise 1. </strong></p><p><em>Create an application consisting of a razor page called Index - but without its backing csharp file. The razor page should print your name.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 2.</strong> </p><p><em>Display your name thus: Add a string variable called strName to the page in Ex 1. Set the variable to your name. Then display the variable strName.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 3.</strong> </p><p><em>Create an application consisting of a razor page called Index - but without its backing csharp file. Create two int variables i and j. Set i to 7 and j to 2. Display their sum using razor syntax.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 4.</strong> </p><p><em>Add a function called, say, GetName to the razor page in the first exercise. The function has a return type of String and returns your name. Now display your name by calling the above function.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 5.</strong> </p><p><em>Create an application consisting of a razor page called Index and its backing csharp file. Create two int properties i and j in the backing class. Set i to 7 and j to 2. Display their sum using razor syntax.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 6.</strong> </p><p><em>Without using razor pages, write a simple ASP.NET Core application that writes a \"Hello World!\" message to the response stream when an HTTP GET request is made to the home page of your website.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 7.</strong> </p><p><em>Without using razor pages, write a simple ASP.NET Core application that sends a FORM consisting of an input textbox and a submit when an HTTP GET request is made to the home page of your website. The application should handle the posted data and respond by sending back the upper case equivalent of the input typed by the user.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 8.</strong> </p><p><em>Create an application with a layout file [full head, body html tags] that shows the current system time in a h1 tag. The file connects to a CSS file called \"mycss.css\", which is placed in a wwwroot directory, and has a class for a p tag that sets its text color to red. Create a razor page called index that shows your name in a \"p\" tag. This page should merge into the layout file. Run the app to verify that your name appears in red.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 9.</strong> </p><p><em>Many CSS frameworks like bootstrap are available on the internet. Find any framework of your choice and create a layout file [full head, body, html, etc.,] by linking its CSS/JS files. Then create two pages - Index and Products. Each page has the same two buttons called \"Home\" and \"Products\". When Home is clicked the user should be taken to the Index page, and when Products is clicked the user should be taken to the Products page.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞FIND&nbsp;A&nbsp;DOCTOR&nbsp;PROJECT - STEP 1</strong></p><p><em>This is now an implementation of the concepts learnt so far, where we start with a new project and add three razor pages - Index, Login and Register. Layout and viewstart files use the CSS/JS based bootstrap library to provide \"color\" to the pages. Tag helpers are used for inter page navigation.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞Ch1A - ASPNET CORE APPLICATION&nbsp;STARTUP (can skip for later)</strong></p><p><strong>Environments in ASP.NET Core</strong></p><p><em>This tutorial explains about the various environments like Development, Staging and Production. We also explain how to set them by various methods and how to conditionally check for environments and perform settings.</em></p><p><strong>Kestrel, IIS, IISHttpServer and HTTP.sys</strong></p><p><em>An ASP.NET Core application cannot directly accept requests from the internet. For this it needs a server that can face the internet and help it communicate with the calling client on the other side. This means that some sort of coupling is required with a server software. This tutorial discusses various possibilities. Discussion of the launchSettings file is reserved for the next tutorial.</em></p><p><strong>The launchSettings.json File and launch Profiles</strong></p><p><em>We learn about the finer details of launchSettings.json file. This file contains various launch profiles to start an application in various modes - such as InProcess, OutOfProcess and direct Kestrel. Visual Studio uses this file to populate a dropdown toolbar so that the application can be started in various modes at the click of a button. This allows for easier debugging and testing of an application.</em></p><p><strong>Logging in ASP.NET Core</strong></p><p><em>Logging helps in troubleshooting, it helps in audit, it helps in getting signals of an imminent application crash. This topic explains the terminology of a log message, and also explains how to configure an application for logging, and also how to observe a sequence of log messages.</em></p><p><strong>Storing and Reading Configuration Key Value Data</strong></p><p><em>We have seen in the previous tutorials that appSettings json file can be used to configure log levels. But this is not the only use of this file - it can, as well, be used to store custom key value data that can be read anywhere in your application. It turns out that log levels are just one of the possible values - there is a lot more that can be done. In this tutorial we shall learn how to store some rudimentary data and then read it back on a razor page.</em></p><p><strong>Using Options Pattern to Read Configuration</strong></p><p><em>In the previous tutorial we read various properties of an appSettings configuration file. But there is a better method for reading complex properties - such as \"Address\" - that we read in the previous tutorial. This is done through the options pattern. Let us now read City and ISDCode of the Address property by using the options pattern.</em></p><p><strong>What and Why of the UseDeveloperExceptionPage Middleware</strong></p><p><em>We shall create an app using visual studio 2022, running .NET 6. The application will artificially throw an un-handled exception. Then we shall verify that if the application is running under development, then asp.net core automatically provides a safety net to handle this exception, and provides a detailed information about the error. But if the same application is&nbsp; in, say, production, then there is no developer exception page, and the application crashes midway, with no response sent.</em></p><p><strong>Writing a Custom Exception Page and the UseExceptionHandler middleware</strong></p><p><em>This tutorial continues our previous tutorial where we learnt that if an application is running under development environment, then ASP.NET Core provides a UseDeveloperExceptionPage middleware that catches un-handled exceptions and provides a detailed information about the snapshot state of the application. But that feature is not recommended for production environment - a developer should provide a custom page to filter out the information that finally reaches the display. Let's learn how!</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞Ch2 - BASIC&nbsp;EVENT&nbsp;HANDLING&nbsp;IN&nbsp;RAZOR&nbsp;PAGES</strong></p><p><strong>How to handle a click event in Razor Pages</strong></p><p><em>An anchor tag helper can be used to specify the name of the click event handler. For this the attribute \"asp-page-handler\" is set equal to the name of the function in the backing class. Read through this tutorial to understand the whole idea. A video is also attached for a first-hand explanation. The tutorial concludes with a walkthrough that demonstrates how a click event can be handled on the server side.</em></p><p><strong>Creating an HTML FORM with Razor Pages</strong></p><p><em>This is an introduction to the most common UI Elements that can be used on a FORM. The article starts with a quick introduction to an html form of only one textbox, and then shows how to translate it to a razor form. Then a checkbox, a radiobuttonlist, and a dropdown are successively added one by one to build a full blown razor form. Data is not posted, a topic reserved for the next tutorials.</em></p><p><strong>How to handle a FORM submit event</strong></p><p><em>A form submit is triggerred by a submit button inside FORM tags. If the method is POST, which is most often the case, then the recommended handler is OnPostAsync. The method should be asynchronous because FORM data is invariably processed through database INSERT and UPDATE queries, which must be done asynchronously. The submitted data can be extracted through the two-way BindProperty. See the linked video for a better understanding.</em></p><p><strong>Program Example on Data Display and FORM Update</strong></p><p><em>(LEVEL IS BEGINNERS) Suppose there is a model called StudentData with properties ID, Name, School and Marks. Also suppose we already have a collection of StudentData records with the first three properties already filled, and Marks is NULL. Write an Index page to display the data of the students in a table of 5 columns. The fifth column contains a link button called Edit. When the link is clicked, the user should be taken to a page called Edit. The Edit page contains a form where Name and Marks can only be edited. Update the collection when the form is submited and redirect the user to the index page to show the updated record.</em></p><p><strong>How to handle Server Side Validation</strong></p><p><em>This article starts with a brief primer on server side validations and why they should be done. A simple model of just one property is used to explain the whole process - starting from setting the validation error messages to finally inserting validation tags to render the errors. We explain how \"asp-validation-for\" attributes can be used to display validation errors, and that too, respectively, for each property and at a location just adjacent to its FORM element(see the screenshot below), and also how the ASP.NET Core engine takes care of almost 99% of your work. We also explain how to, optionally, display a gist of all validation errors using the \"asp-validation-summary\" attribute.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞EXERCISES&nbsp;ON Ch2 - Basic Event Handling in Razor Pages</strong></p><p><strong>Exercise 1.</strong></p><p><em>Create an ASP.NET Core application that has a razor page called Index, and that shows an anchor \"Click Me!\". When the anchor is clicked the anchor should disappear and it should be replaced by the message \"I am clicked\". Write the entire code in the Index.cshtml razor page - no backing class is to be used.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 2.</strong></p><p><em>The first exercise can also be solved by sending an arbitrary querystring parameter when the anchor link is clicked. The \"Request\" can be tested for the presence of that parameter in a conditional \"if\" statement, and accordingly render the message or the anchor. You might have to google about how to send query string parameters with an anchor tag helper. Then you can google about how to read query string parameters in a razor page.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 3.</strong></p><p><em>Instead of following the approach in Ex. 2 above, another alternative to sending a query string through an anchor tag helper is to send a query string by using an overload of \"RedirectToPage\". Implement this scheme by redirection from the click event handler.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 4.</strong></p><p><em>Solve Ex. 1 without using the addTagHelpers directive.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 5.</strong></p><p><em>Create a FORM of two inputs that, respectively, accept two numbers - say, i and j. The submit event should be handled by the backing class and the sum returned through a query string parameter. Display the sum on the same FORM.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 6.</strong></p><p><em>Create a FORM of two inputs that, respectively, accept two numbers - say, i and j. Display the sum on the same FORM but without using a query string.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 7.</strong></p><p><em>Create a login form of two inputs - UserName and Password. Show a message \"Login succeeded\" if the user enters UserName as \"u\", and Password as \"p\". Otherwise show the message \"Invalid credentials\". The message should appear somewhere on the same form.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 8.</strong></p><p><em>Create a razor page of two forms on the same page. Each form has one input textbox and a submit button. The first form has a textbox for first name, whereas the second form has a textbox for last name. Initially only the first form is visible. When the user submits the form, the first form hides away and the second form becomes visible. When the user submits the second form, it too is hidden and a message showing the full name should appear instead. Hint: on the basis of what you have learnt so far, you might have to use an input of type=\"hidden\".</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞FIND&nbsp;A&nbsp;DOCTOR&nbsp;PROJECT - Step 2</strong></p><p><em>Event handlers for Login and Registration buttons are connected now. Two model classes RegistrationInfo and LoginInfo are added to connect the registration and login forms to the respective OnPostAsync handlers. We verify that FORM data is indeed being received, and server side validation and validation summary are functional. We are now at the point of database connectivity where we shall register the user.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞Ch3 - DATABASE&nbsp;CONNECTIVITY - I</strong></p><p><strong>Getting Started with Database Connectivity</strong></p><p><em>Here is a to-the-point tutorial on how database connectivity works in ASP.NET Core. A 3-step roadmap is laid for running your first query to a database of your choice. The tutorial concludes with an example walkthrough on adding nuget packages for a sqlite database. The actual database connectivity is done in later tutorials.</em></p><p><strong>Getting Started with Database INSERT of Form data</strong></p><p><em>A form of only one input textbox is POSTed and the data is inserted into a sqlite database. This is a six step walkthrough that starts from creating a model, followed by a DAL based on the DbContext class. We also explain how an application is configured for dependency injection of the DbContext, and also, how the DbContext is extracted from the constructor of a PageModel class, and ultimately used to run a database query.</em></p><p><strong>Strategy to handle a DbUpdateException</strong></p><p><em>SaveChanges can fail if a constraint fails, if a connection error occurs or if any generic error occurs. So it should always be wrapped in a try-catch handler to gracefully handle the DbUpdateException. But how to inform the user about such a failure? One way is to use the built-in server side validation to artificially push the error as a validation failure.</em></p><p><strong>Specifying Primary Key (s) and the DbSet.Find() method</strong></p><p><em>This is a brief explanation of how to specify single primary key on a model through attributes - but this approach fails when multiple columns are to be set as the primary key. We explain that such a composite primary key has to be set through the DbContext. Finally, we explain how to query a record on the basis of its primary key.</em></p><p><strong>Displaying Data and OnGetAsync</strong></p><p><em>This tutorial continues from where we left the tutorial on INSERT query (see the link below for a recap). The code we discussed there has been extended to display the inserted data. In the first part of this tutorial we explain the minimal three basic things that must be done to display data on a razor page. Then we incorporate those additions into the index page and its backing class to show the whole idea in action.</em></p><p><strong>Deleting Records from a Database with EF Core</strong></p><p><em>We start by explaining the general scheme for deleting a record from a table. A foreach loop adds an anchor link to each record. The primary key (id) of each record is set as an attribute of each respective anchor link, and each anchor link also binds to a handler function in the backing class. When such a link is clicked the handler receives that id as a parameter and a C# code carries on the deletion.</em></p><p><strong>Editing Records on the same Razor Page with EF Core</strong></p><p><em>This tutorial discusses the most desired scenario where data entry form and the already existing records are shown on the same page. Each record has an edit link adjacent to it. When this link is clicked, the record appears in the same data-entry form, so that the user can make changes and submit it. See the image below for a quick understanding of the problem being addressed here. This tutorial also explains a general scheme for editing with EF Core.</em></p><p><strong>CRUD with a Checkbox in a Razor Form</strong></p><p><em>This tutorial extends the one-textbox FORM that we have implemented for CRUD operations in the previous tutorial (see link below). Now we add a checkbox to that form and observe how easy is it to make an addition to a project that is already CRUD-ready!</em></p><p><strong>CRUD with a Radiobuttonlist in a Razor Form</strong></p><p><em>This tutorial extends the FORM that we have implemented in the previous tutorial (see link below). Now we add a radiobuttonlist to that form and observe how easy is it to make an addition to a project that is already CRUD-ready! The radiobuttonlist is backed by a hard-coded C# enumeration. We also explain how to specify the conversion from an enum to an INT data-type on the database side.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞EXERCISES&nbsp;ON Ch3 - Database Connectivity - I</strong></p><p><strong>Exercise 1.</strong></p><p>Write down all the steps needed for the initial setup for connecting to a Sqlite database.</p><p><strong>Exercise 2.</strong></p><p><em>Create a model - called, say, MyModel - that has a primary key property of string datatype - called CountryID - and another property of string type - called DisplayName. Both the properties should be marked as required. Create a form (complete with inputs, submit and validation spans) that helps you save records of type \"MyModel\" to a table of sqlite database. Your code should gracefully handle a DbUpdateException. Test your project by adding a few records, and also verify that duplicate CountryID cannot be saved to the database. Note: Primary key of string datatype must be marked as DatabaseGeneratedOption.None, otherwise it will not work because the default is DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 3.</strong></p><p><em>Create a form of one textarea and a submit button. This form is to be used for bulk insert of records of type \"MyModel\" [see previous exercise] to a table of sqlite database. This is how the form will be used: a user will type rows of records in a semi-colon separated format, for example Brazil may be typed as BZ;Brazil, where \"BZ\" is CountryID and \"Brazil\" is the DisplayName. When the form is posted, the rows should be read in a loop and each record extracted, and inserted into the database. Finally, a summary of the number of records succeeded and that failed should be shown somewhere on the same form.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 4 [checkbox insert and display] </strong></p><p><em>Create a razor page that has a FORM of two inputs - first a textbox for the name of a player and second a checkbox \"Plays Chess\". When the form is submitted, the data is stored in a table. The same razor page should separately display the lists of chess players and non-chess players. We suggest that a three column layout be created using suitable CSS. The left column should show non-chess players, the middle column should show the data entry FORM and the right column should the chess players. Note: You will need to use the \".Where\" LINQ for filtering chess players.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 5 [toggle transfer between lists] </strong></p><p><em>Extend the above exercise thus: Add an anchor link (called, say, \"move to non-chess players\") adjacent to each record of chess players. When this anchor is clicked the chess playing status of the player should be toggled so that the same player gets \"transferred\" to the list of non-chess players. Similarly add an anchor link adjacent to each record of non-chess players. Run the project and verify that \"transfers\" actually happen.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 6 [seed random data] </strong></p><p><em>Create a model class having three properties - ID [auto int PK], FirstName, LastName and DateOfBirth - the last one being of the DateTime datatype. Configure your project for sqlite database connectivity. The Index razor page should have an anchor link called \"Insert 10 random Records\" and connected to a function \"SeedData\". Just below the anchor link, the data is displayed in an html table of four columns - ID, First Name, Last Name and Date Of Birth. Run the project to verify that each click adds 10 random records to the table. Note: you can use the Random class to generate random ASCII text.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 7 [pagination] </strong></p><p><em>Add paging to the previous exercise by adding \"Next\", \"Prev\" anchors below the table. Take a page size of, say, 7. \"Prev\" link should be disabled on the first page, whereas the \"Next\" should be disabled on the last page. Use suitable CSS to disable an anchor link.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 8 [sorting]</strong></p><p><em> Add sorting to the previous exercise by replacing the Date of Birth heading with an anchor link. When the anchor is clicked repeatedly, the sort order changes from ascending to descending, and vice versa. Test it thus: First run the project to verify that paging works and the sort order is the default order as seen from the sequence of ID. Now move to the next page and click the Date Of Birth heading. The table should now reset to the first page, but the list should display as sorted. Now click on the Next link [and then back and forth] to verify that the remaining records can be seen in the same sorted order.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞FIND&nbsp;A&nbsp;DOCTOR&nbsp;PROJECT - Step 3</strong></p><p><em>The project has now been configured for database connectivity through Sqlite. The Registration module is fully functional - a user can register as a doctor or a patient - and a database INSERT entry is now working. EMail ID is the primary key. If a record already exists then a DbUpdateException is handled and failure is shown through a validation summary. If the registration is successful, the user is redirected to the login page. If he logs in with wrong email/password then he is asked to ammend and retry. But if he logs in with an email that isn't registered yet, then he is asked to register himself. Next we learn how to consolidate the code through ViewImports.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞Ch4 - MODULARITY</strong></p><p><strong>_ViewImports file and the do's and don'ts</strong></p><p><em>_ViewImports.cshtml is shared by all the razor pages in its peer directory, and in the sub-directories below it. It is like an include file, and it is used to type a list of common directives that would otherwise have to be typed in each of the razor pages. A razor page takes into account the entire hierarchy of _ViewImports files above it.</em></p><p><strong>Razor Components in the Context of Razor Pages Apps</strong></p><p><em>Razor components are stand-alone, embeddable units that replace themselves with pure HTML, CSS and JS markup. They can accept parameters from the host page. We discuss below how they differ from partial pages, and we also discuss the structure of a component page, and also how to use the &lt;component&gt; tag to easily embed a component into a razor page.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞EXERCISES&nbsp;ON Ch4 - Modularity</strong></p><p><strong>Exercise 1 [print name, razor components] </strong></p><p><em>Write a razor component that has a function called \"GetName\" that returns your name as a string. The razor component displays your name by calling this function. Embed this component in your index.cshtml razor page to display your name.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 2 [count chars in a string, razor components] </strong></p><p><em>Write a razor component that takes two parameters - HostName and CharToCount. The first parameter is the name of a website - like microsoft - without the prefix \"https://\" and the suffix \".com\", and the second parameter is a character, such as 'A'. Your razor component will send a hit to https://{HostName}.com and download the page as a string, and count the number of {CharToCount} in that string and display the characters counted. Use this razor component in a razor page that has a form that accepts HostName and CharToCount as inputs from the user. When the user submits the form, these inputs should be passed to the razor component to display the number of characters found. Hint: use an HttpClient request in \"OnInitializedAsync\" to download the string and count the chars. You might want to review the tutorial L02 - Razor Components where makeSquare function has been discussed along with passing parameters.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 3 [general purpose table component] </strong></p><p><em>Write a razor component called Table.razor that accepts three parameters - a string array String[] for its heading row, a String[][] array for the remaining rows to display the data, and a third parameter for css class to be applied to the table. So this is a flexible table that can be re-used in any project. Use this component in a razor page to render a table of three columns - ID, Name and Phone. The data can be of, say, two records. Also pass a css class as a parameter so that the table gets a pleasant look.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 4 [click event in a razor component] </strong></p><p><em>A razor component can handle and process a click event if it is written as a blazor component. Refer the attached blog link and the linked youtube video to see the basic steps needed for this integration. After that write a component that displays a new quote, each time its button is clicked. Use a String array to hold a few quotations so that a user can click and cycle through them.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞FIND&nbsp;A&nbsp;DOCTOR&nbsp;PROJECT - Step 4</strong></p><p><em>In this step we tidy the Index.cshtml, Register.cshtml and Login.cshtml razor pages by moving various common directives (like addTagHelper) and namespaces to a viewimports file.

Now we are ready to write the home page of doctors.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞Ch 5 - AREAS&nbsp;AND&nbsp;PARTIAL&nbsp;VIEWS</strong></p><p><strong>Concept of Areas and an Authorization Scheme</strong></p><p><em>This is a comprehensive discussion on the need for \"areas\", and how to practically create \"areas\", and how, un-like classic MVC, routing occurs out-of-the-box when razor pages are used. We also discuss how tag helpers help us create proper anchor links to pages inside areas. In the end we present a practical login and authorization scheme for projects that use areas.</em></p><p><strong>Partial Views from a Practical Perspective</strong></p><p><em>So this article starts by explaining the various aspects of a partial view from a practical, day-to-day perspective. We have totally removed those parts that are either redundant or too complicated to be of any use for a practical developer. Then we take a small 3-step walkthrough that shows how to create a partial view, and how to consume it in a razor page. We also explain how a conditional menu can be conveniently implemented using the ideas of partial views. Partial Views + Razor Components can add to the confusion of a developer, so we finally conclude with a comparison with razor components.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞EXERCISES&nbsp;ON Ch5 - Areas and Partial Views</strong></p><p><strong>Exercise 1 [simple partial] </strong></p><p><em>Create an application that has a razor page called Index. Now add a partial page called _MyPartial that displays your name in an h1 tag. Use this partial in the Index page to display your name. The helper directives should be placed in a view imports file.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 2 [navigation to area] </strong></p><p><em>Create an application that has a razor page called index containing an anchor link. Add an Area called Albums. Inside this area there is an Index razor page that displays a welcome message in, say, an h1 tag. When the beforementioned anchor link is clicked, the user should navigate to the index page of the Albums area.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞FIND&nbsp;A&nbsp;DOCTOR&nbsp;PROJECT - Step 5</strong></p><p><em>Two \"Areas\" are added - Doctor and Patient. The pages relevant to a doctor shall stay in the former, whereas of a patient in the latter. Home pages have been added for both. Partial pages for _Header, _Menu and _Footer have also been added for the doctor's area, and similarly partial pages for _Header and _Footer are added for the patient's area. This is what happens now: when a user logs in, then depending on the UserType he is redirected to his \"Area\". Next let us learn about Authentication and Authorization so that the users of a specific \"Role\" can only access the pages.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞Ch6 - STATE&nbsp;MANAGEMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Reading, Writing and Deleting Cookies in ASP.NET Core</strong></p><p><em>We start this walkthrough with a small introduction to the concept of a cookie, and then we explain the various ASP.NET Core snippets to (a) create a cookie, (b) read a cookie and (c) delete a cookie. And lastly, we create a fully functional application for creating and deleting cookies. You can run the application to see the whole concept in action! We strongly recommend that you watch the linked video for finer details.</em></p><p><strong>Cookie Consent Banner with ITrackingConsentFeature</strong></p><p><em>This is a walkthrough on how to obtain user consent for usage of cookies on an asp.net core website. This project uses the ITrackingConsentFeature interface to determine if the user has already given his consent, and also to obtain the correct cookie string as per the http format. The readymade functions of this interface make it extremely easy for a developer to obtain a user's consent.</em></p><p><strong>How to use Session for State Management</strong></p><p><em>This article explains behind-the-scenes mechanism by which \"Session\" is implemented in ASP.NET Core. We also enumerate the four extension methods that ASP.NET Core provides for reading and writing session variables. After that we present a walkthrough where existence of a Session key is checked to conditionally show a login link, or to show her user-name along with a log-off link that clears the user-name from the Session cache.</em></p><p><strong>Serializing DateTime into Session</strong></p><p><em>There is no built-in method for storing DateTime into a session variable in ASP.NET Core. However, the Microsoft MSDN docs suggest that developers can create their own extension methods on ISession, and they have provided code for one such pair of Set&lt;T&gt; and Get&lt;T&gt; methods that use json serialization to store any serializable type as a string. We have copy-pasted their code, and used it to create a small walkthrough that demonstrates how a DateTime instance can be stored in a session variable.</em></p><p><strong>When and how to use TempData</strong></p><p><em>TempData can be used to pass data from one razor page to another. Although QueryString and Session variables can be used to achieve the same objective, yet TempData provides a briefer and cleaner way, and most importantly, it is built into the ASP.NET framework. The most attractive feature of TempData is that the data is automatically cleared away after a first read/extract operation - whenever it takes place. The tutorial ends with a walkthrough where TempData is saved in one page and used for showing a message on a second page. The message appears only once.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞Ch 7 - AUTHENTICATION&nbsp;AND&nbsp;AUTHORIZATION</strong></p><p><strong>Configuring Role based Authorization</strong></p><p><em>This is an explanation of how an \"Area\" based ASP.NET Core project can be configured for role and policy based authorization.

Finally, we discuss what is a returnUrl, and what is LocalRedirect, and when should it be used.</em></p><p><strong>Displaying User Info on each Page he visits</strong></p><p><em>This is a snippet on showing \"You are logged as ...\" on every page that an authenticated and authorized user visits. The code can be inserted in a razor page or in a partial page.</em></p><p><strong>SignOutAsync with Tag Helpers</strong></p><p><em>Following is a brief scheme on signing out a logged-in user. A function for sign-out is written in the same file as for the login code. Then this function is called from the click of some anchor link and \"SignOutAsync\" called to kill the login cookie. Finally, a redirection is done to the login page.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞FIND&nbsp;A&nbsp;DOCTOR&nbsp;PROJECT - Step 6</strong></p><p><em>Policy based authorization has now been applied. A logged-in doctor ONLY can view the pages of the \"doctor\" area, and similarly, a logged-in patient only can view pages of his area. RememberMe is also functional now - such a user is directly taken to the home page of his area. Email of a logged in user is now shown on each page he visits. Code for sign-out has also been added. With this the project is now fully functional for login, registration and the sign-out modules. We leave it as an exercise for the student to add a \"Change Password\" module.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞Ch7A - IDENTITY&nbsp;IN&nbsp;ASPNET&nbsp;CORE (can skip for later)</strong></p><p><strong>Collecting the Pre-requisites for Identity based Authentication</strong></p><p><em>We shall create an identity based project from scratch. Although, visual studio provides a scaffolding for all the various modules, but personally I find all that very difficult to integrate with my own projects and my own css files. That's the motivation for starting from scratch. It will be a series of tutorials. In this first tutorial, I shall add nuget packages, followed by an IdentityDbContext, and finally run a migration to create the database on local sql server.</em></p><p><strong>Adding a Login Page to an Identity based Authentication Project</strong></p><p><em>This tutorial shall continue from the previous tutorial where we have made a basic initialization, and we have also created a database to hold the data of our users. In this tutorial we shall make additional configuration to specify our login and access denied pages. We shall also add a restricted (or protected page) and verify that when an un-authenticated user tries to access it, then he is automatically redirected to the login page.</em></p><p><strong>Adding a Registration Page to an Identity based Authentication Project</strong></p><p><em>The problem with the built-in registration page provided by ASP.NET Core Identity API is that it contains a lot of tags and bootstrap attributes that make it time consuming to integrate it into a project that doesn't use bootstrap or jQuery. The objective of this article is to explain how to create a neat and simple registration page that can be styled with any css and javascript of choice. We use a simple html table to create a form, but we will not use any css and client side validation because that can always be done with the web designer teams.</em></p><p><strong>Account Verification in an Identity based Authentication Project</strong></p><p><em>Recall from the previous tutorial that in our program.cs file we have set SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true. This prevents immediate login to a newly registered user. The user is compulsorily required to verify his account through an email or SMS sent to his phone. For this, a link containing a specially generated confirmation token is sent to him. When the user clicks this link then this token is verified on the server side, and the user is informed of the confirmation status.</em></p><p><strong>Resending an Account Verification EMail in Identity based Authentication</strong></p><p><em>As soon as a new user registers on a website, an account verification email or an sms is immediately sent to him. But it is possible that a user never receives the email, or perhaps he is unable to locate the email that he might have received a few days back. Such a user would ask for the confirmation link to be sent again. This means that we need a mechanism for resending an email to a user. This tutorial explains the steps needed to generate and resend the link to that user.</em></p><p><strong>Forgot Password functionality in Identity based Authentication</strong></p><p><em>Very often a user is unable to remember the password that he created for a website. In such circumstances, the forgot password link comes to his rescue - it is one of the most important links on a login form. And, in this tutorial we shall implement the functionality for a forgot password link. Let's proceed!</em></p><p><strong>Reset Password functionality in Identity based Authentication</strong></p><p><em>We have seen in the previous tutorial that when a user fills the forgot password form, then he is emailed a link to the reset password page. The link contains a password reset code. Now, in this tutorial we shall add a page for reset password.</em></p><p><strong>Claim based Authorization with Identity</strong></p><p><em>In its simplest terms, a claim is a name-value pair used to verify authorization. For example, you may be authorized to access a page if a claim of name \"my_role\" and of value \"admin\" is attached to your identity. In this tutorial we learn how to configure a project for claim based authorization, and how to add claim based authorization to a page.</em></p><p><strong>Layout Pages and LoginPartial for Identity</strong></p><p><em>It is a good idea to show the user name of a logged user in the header of each page of a website. And, if the user is not logged in, then the login and register buttons can be shown instead. The best way to implement it is to use partial views in combination with layout pages. This tutorial explains the steps for this.</em></p><p><strong>Sign out functionality in Identity based Authentication</strong></p><p><em>A sign out link allows a logged user to log out of your website. It is usually shown in the header of a page and close to the name of the logged in user. In this tutorial we shall learn how to implement this functionality.</em></p><p><strong>Account Lockout Functionality in Identity</strong></p><p><em>You must have seen on various websites that a user account gets locked if the user makes about three unsuccessful login attempts. The exact same functionality is supported by the Identity API also - and it is possible to configure the number of failed attempts before an account gets locked. If a lockout timespan is specified, then the account remains locked for that specific duration. The default value is 5 minutes, but it can be set to any value. The number of failed attempts and the clock are reset when a user performs a successful login.</em></p><p><strong>Enabling 2-factor Authentication in Identity</strong></p><p><em>Two factor authentication gives additional security to a login process. But this type of authentication has to be specifically enabled by a user. For this he clicks a button to receive an authentication code or token. This token is provided by the asp.net core app. After that he installs an authenticator app from Microsoft, or from Google or from IOS Play Stores. Then he has to enter that authentication code into the authenticator app and receive a code from that app. This code is then entered into the asp.net core application, and the two factor authentication gets enabled. In this tutorial we shall add a razor page to enable two factor authentication.</em></p><p><strong>Login with 2-Factor Authentication</strong></p><p><em>Consider a user who has enabled 2-factor authentication as explained in the previous tutorial. Such a user is required to authenticate twice before he can access the pages of a website. The first authentication is through the common login page, and then immediately after that he is redirected to a second login page where he has to enter a validation code obtained from his Google, Microsoft or IOS authenticator app. The purpose of this tutorial is to complete the second login page - also called 2-factor login page.</em></p><p><strong>Disabling 2-Factor Authentication</strong></p><p><em>The purpose of this tutorial is to add the functionality that allows a user to disable his 2-factor authentication. For this we shall have to modify the _LoginPartial page so that the disable 2-factor authentication link is shown to him.</em></p><p><strong>Creating a Google OAuth App for Authentication</strong></p><p><em>Social media based authentication requires us to create an oauth app on a social media platform such as google, facebook, twitter, github. This app provides us a client id and a client secret key for use in various classes that provide social media integration. In this tutorial we have a walkthrough for creating an oauth app on the google cloud console. Steps for other social media are similar - so you can take them as an exercise.</em></p><p><strong>Social Media based Authentication, Remember Me and Signout</strong></p><p><em>Social media based login provides a neat and user-friendly means of logging into your website. Users are more likely to trust this method because of the level of security provided by various social media platforms. It helps us simplify the sign-in process by delegating many complexities to social media platforms. In this tutorial we present a project that requires a user to login with his google account. Once he logs in, then he is shown his email-id, name and profile picture. We also explain persistence of cookie, i.e., how the user can be remembered, and also the signout scheme.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞FIND&nbsp;A&nbsp;DOCTOR&nbsp;PROJECT - Step 7</strong></p><p><em>Now we start completing a doctor's profile. Three modules are done - (1) first the doctor's name, phone and photo upload, (2) second the fees he charges, and (3) a dropdown of specializations. A partial view is added for specializations because specializations will be used from the patient side also, during the search of doctors.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞Ch9 - AJAX&nbsp;COMMUNICATION</strong></p><p><strong>Ajax based POST of a Razor Page</strong></p><p>How to POST an ASP.NET Core Razor FORM through an Ajax Request. We discuss a practical approach that is to-the-point and easy to understand. The given code is ready to copy-paste!</p><p><strong>How to POST data with AJAX Independently</strong></p><p>Anti-forgery token is NOT available outside of &lt;form&gt; tags. This article, alongwith the appended&nbsp; video, explains how to use IAntiforgery service to solve this limitation, and POST data, especially as an AJAX request, when a full-fledged form is not possible?</p><p><strong>Bare minimum code for a parameterized AJAX GET Request to a C# function</strong></p><p>The following project has a textbox with a send button. The click event fires an AJAX GET request and sends a string parameter to an ASP.NET Core application, which responds by converting the parameter to its uppercase equivalent. The client side script has been written using pure javascript.</p><p><strong>Admin Panel with Content on the Right</strong></p><p>This project is about creating an Admin Panel that would be suitable for a reporting project or an EBook that shows a table of links on the left and the corresponding content on the right side. The content is obtained by an Ajax call to an ASP.NET Core application. Source code for all the three files has been given and explained below.</p><p><strong>Authentication and Authorization with AJAX Requests</strong></p><p>In brief: Just two additions are required to implement AJAX based authorization in your existing ASP.NET Core application - first is on the javascript side - where the response code should be tested, and second on the server side where User.IsInRole has to be tested. The concept is explained in the text that follows, and a working example is described in the appended youtube video!</p><p><strong>Inline, In-place Edit, Update, Cancel of records without a page refresh</strong></p><p>Simplest explanation of AJAX based Edit, Update, Cancel operations on a row of an HTML table. An ASP.NET Core POST handler receives the updated values that can be processed for an update to a database.</p><p><strong>Master Slave Cascading Dropdowns with Ajax</strong></p><p>In nutshell: The selection change event of the master dropdown is used to send the \"id\" of the selected item to the server, which sends back a collection of items for the slave dropdown. A javascript based Ajax GET request is used for this communication with the server.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞FIND&nbsp;A&nbsp;DOCTOR&nbsp;PROJECT - Step 8</strong></p><p><em>Cascading dropdowns and ajax are used for completing the fourth module of a doctor's profile where the state and city of the clinic address have to be specified. For this we have added a partial view _ClinicAreaPIN to render the cascading dropdowns. A partial view has been added because a patient will also need these dropdowns during his search for a doctor. A JSON based database is used to store the State-City data.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞CORS HANDLING with ASPNET CORE (can skip for later)</strong></p><p><strong>How Cross Origin requests (CORS) fail - example with ajax javascript</strong></p><p><em>We shall run two ASPNET Core apps concurrently - the first exposes a web API, whereas the other shows a web page containing two links - the first of these links causes a direct call to the web API, and the second fires an ajax based call through javascript. A direct call is not a cross-origin (CORS) call because its destination is visible in the browser, but a call that occurs through an invocation of XMLHttpRequest or fetch API is a cross-origin (CORS) call. We shall verify that a click on the first link succeeds, but the second link fails because a browser blocks cross-origin calls.</em></p><p><strong>Why cross-origin requests (CORS) fail and why they succeed?</strong></p><p><em>In the previous tutorial, we demonstrated how a browser blocks cross-origin calls. So you must surely be wondering why cross-origin requests to CDN-hosted CSS files and fonts succeed. What's behind that success? Why do browsers permit some requests and block others? In this tutorial, we examine the reasons behind this. It will help us allow cross-origin requests in our ASPNET Core apps!</em></p><p><strong>Enabling CORS with a Policy</strong></p><p><em>An ASPNET Core application can permit cross-origin requests by adding \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" header to the HTTP response. Cross-origin requests are not allowed by default; they must be allowed explicitly. One way of doing it is by defining a suitable policy in the application pipeline. In this tutorial, we learn the steps required for this. We shall also learn how to define multiple policies so that each end-point can serve requests to its own set of origins.</em></p><p><strong>Enabling CORS for Specific CSS or JS Files</strong></p><p><em>Static files are NOT accessible cross-origin if we call UseStaticFiles before UseCors. But if we reverse the order, every static file becomes accessible to permitted origins. So we have an all-or-none type of situation. CORS can either be disabled for every static file or disabled for none. This tutorial explains how to enable CORS for just a small subset of files, as done by the various CDN networks.</em></p><p><strong>Primer on CORS Preflight Requests</strong></p><p><em>Browsers consider some cross-origin requests as unsafe. For example, an HTTP PUT request is considered unsafe. A browser first queries the server if it accepts that type of verb or request or headers by sending an HTTP OPTIONS request, which is called a preflight request. In this tutorial, we learn some concepts regarding preflight requests.</em></p><p><strong>Configuring CORS Preflight Policy</strong></p><p><em>In this tutorial, we learn how to set a CORS policy that will respond to a pre-flight OPTIONS request. This policy will specify the list of acceptable request headers, a list of acceptable HTTP methods and a duration value for the Access-Control-Max-Age header.</em></p><p><strong>Credential Cookies with Cross-Origin Requests</strong></p><p><em>By default, a browser doesn't send authentication cookies with cross-origin requests. It sends cookies only if the javascript code sets a property called \"credentials\" to true or \"include.\" But that's not the whole story. The server-side code must also set an \"AllowCredentials\" cross-origin policy so that it can respond with a header called \"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials.\" If the browser doesn't receive this header, it logs a cross-origin failure even if the origin is white-listed on the server. Thus, it is a matter of writing the javascript code correctly, and configuring the cross-origin policy that signals the browser that cross-origin cookies are allowed. This polocy will not work if wild-cards are used in the \"WithOrigins\" function, or \"AllowAnyOrigin\" function has been used.</em></p><p><strong>Practical Verification of Credential Cookies</strong></p><p><em>In this tutorial, we have two applications - the first is an ASPNET Core application that implements a CORS policy to accept cookies from the second application. The second application makes a javascript request to the first application and sends a cookie. The first application then reads the cookie and echoes back the contents of that cookie, which are presented by the browser through a javascript alert box. The source code of both the projects is provided in the attached downloads.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞Ch 10 - UNDERSTANDING&nbsp;LINQ&nbsp;QUERIES</strong></p><p><strong>SingleOrDefault, Find, FirstOrDefault, Single and First</strong></p><p>This is an explanation of SingleOrDefault, FirstOrDefault and Find methods from a practical point of view. We have explained when to use which one and how to use. We have also explained how Single is different from First, and how Single is different from SingleOrDefault, and also how First is different from FirstOrDefault.</p><p><strong>Where, Include and ToList</strong></p><p>This is an explanation of Where, Include and the ToList methods from a practical point of view. We have explained when to use which one and how to use. We have also explained how a SQL JOIN can be performed by using the \"Include\" function of EF Core.</p><p><strong>How to Sort Records</strong></p><p>A result set can be sorted in ascending as well as descending order. It is even possible to perform a chained sorting by using \"ThenBy\" and \"ThenByDescending\" methods. Finally we discuss whether \"OrderBy\" should be before or after \"Where\".</p><p><strong>Direct Execution of SQL Queries and Stored Procedures</strong></p><p>EF Core translates your LINQ expressions into SQL language queries. However, sometimes it is easier, convenient and faster (as determined by testing) to run queries directly on a database. This tutorial explains how to run SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE and execute Stored Procedures and obtain the resultset directly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞FIND&nbsp;A&nbsp;DOCTOR&nbsp;PROJECT - Step 9</strong></p><p><em>Partial pages for _Consultation and _Consultations are added for creating/editing a consultation and viewing all the consultations. Then razor pages for Consultation are added to both the doctor and patient. The home pages of doctor and patient are also updated to show all the consultations.</em></p><p><em>The patient profile module is also completed now.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞Ch 11 - DATABASE&nbsp;CONNECTIVITY - III</strong></p><p><strong>Status of the App_Data folder in ASP.NET Core and what is the way forward?</strong></p><p><em>Looking for the \"protected\" App_Data folder in ASP.NET Core? The news is that it doesn't have that status anymore. It is no longer a \"Special\" folder. However, a workaround exists, and I demonstrate it in this tutorial. This tutorial explains how to read the contents of a notepad file (located in a \"protected\" folder of any random name). The contents are read from within the application, and displayed. Later we verify that the same notepad file cannot be accessed from the browser. This concept can easily be extended to use XML as a database, a topic we shall explore in some future posts.</em></p><p><strong>How to use XML as a database in ASP.NET Core</strong></p><p><em>This is the simplest example of reading and updating a record. For simplicity, the record consists of just one property called Name. An input textbox is used to display the \"Name\" and the same textbox is used to post the updated value. Reading and writing is done with the built-in XMLSerializer class.</em></p><p><strong>Repository Pattern and Dependency Injection with XML as Database</strong></p><p><em>This is a walkthrough on how to make calls to an XML database via repository pattern and dependency injection. We also give a brief introduction to the repository pattern and dependency injection, and also explain the associated benefits.</em></p><p><strong>MySQL Database Connectivity in an ASP.NET Core Razor Page Project</strong></p><p><em>These are the minimal steps for connecting to a MySQL database server with EF Core. A simple application of one textbox form has been used to demonstrate how records can be inserted into a table in a MySQL database. The tables and database are created automatically by EF Core on the basis of code first approach.</em></p><p><strong>SQL Server Database Connectivity in an ASP.NET Core Razor Page Project</strong></p><p><em>These are the minimal steps for connecting to a Microsoft SQL Server database with EF Core. A simple application of one textbox form has been used to demonstrate how records can be inserted into a table in a SQL Server database. The tables and database are created automatically by EF Core on the basis of code first approach.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞Ch11A - EF CORE BEST&nbsp;PRACTICES&nbsp;AND&nbsp;PERFORMANCE</strong></p><p><strong>Set a SQL Server Project</strong></p><p><em>In this tutorial we shall set a project to use SQL Server as our database. You can obtain this project from the downloads attached to this video. But still I recommend that you go through this tutorial to ensure that everything is setup correctly on your specific machine. You might have to substitute your own connection string.</em></p><p><strong>Identify Slow Commands with Logging and Tags</strong></p><p><em>EF Core provides logs that help us determine the time taken by a specific query to finish. The logs also display the actual SQL query that was executed on the database end. This means that we have a very transparent way of knowing the actual command in SQL syntax, and also about the time it took for completion. Hence we can diagnose queries that execute too slow - possibly because an index was missing on the database. In this tutorial we also examine how to use tags with logs.</em></p><p><strong>Comparison of Select, Projection, Tracking and Execution in Database</strong></p><p><em>We shall use various methods to calulate the sum of prices of all the records in the items table. We will also take note of the times taken. Usually the best results are obtained if tracking is disabled for readonly queries and if SELECT is limited to just the columns needed and, if possible, by allowing the calculations to take place in the database. But keep in mind that each query has its own circumstances. So NEVER ASSUME RESULTS. TEST, TEST and TEST is the best way to determine the optimal query in each case.</em></p><p><strong>Lazy Loading and the n+1 problem</strong></p><p><em>Lazy loading is a great O/RM pattern that AUTOMATICALLY loads dependent (child) data when it is first accessed. The delayed loading is both an advantage and a disadvantage. This tutorial explains both these aspects and the associated pitfalls. EF Core doesn't enable lazy loading by default.</em></p><p><strong>Buffering and Streaming of Resultset</strong></p><p><em>A query can first store the entire resultset into memory, and then use a foreach loop to process each item. Alternatively, it can stream each result into a foreach loop one by one. We examine both these possibilities in this tutorial.</em></p><p><strong>Raw SQL with FromSqlRaw for Efficiency</strong></p><p><em>Suppose your database team have already provided you an optimized query in SQL syntax. Or let's say you have a legacy, old setup that makes it compulsory to run a query in raw SQL syntax. In such cases you can use the FromSqlRaw extension to make that call.</em></p><p><strong>Stored Procedures and Secure Parameterization to Prevent SQL Injection attacks</strong></p><p><em>Raw SQL queries and Stored Procedures can be executed with the FromSqlRaw extension. It is very common that these queries and procedures require parameters on the basis of values provided by a user. User-provided parameters are often a source of sql injection attacks. In this tutorial we learn how to pass parameters in a safe manner.</em></p><p><strong>Batching in EF Core and Planning your Bulk Updates</strong></p><p><em>EF Core uses batching to execute bulk updates in a single trip to the database. You can always fine-tune your code by carefully sequencing your statements so that ef core can batch them up. In the second part of this article we have a walkthrough to analyze a piece of code that triggers various trips to the database server, and we explain how that same code can be simplified and optimized to one single trip.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞Ch12 - DOCKER&nbsp;CONTAINERIZATION (can skip for later)</strong></p><p><strong>What is Docker, Dockerfile, DockerImage and Containerization?</strong></p><p><em>This article is a beginner's introduction to the terminology associated with docker files, docker images and containers. I have kept the explanation bare simple so that it's easy to get started. I have tried to explain the most basic questions like what is a docker, what is it's use for you, and what the basic terms mean in nutshell.</em></p><p><strong>How to Create a Docker Image with Visual Studio</strong></p><p><em>This is a walkthrough on creating a docker image with visual studio. We start by creating a simple asp.net core project with sqlite database connectivity, and then explain how Dockerfile can be easily created, followed by a docker image. We have included database connectivity because we shall use the same project for persistence with docker volumes later on.</em></p><p><strong>How to run a Docker Image with Docker Desktop</strong></p><p><em>This is a walkthrough on running a docker image. We start by explaining the commands for listing the docker images on a computer. Then we explain the commands for running a docker image, and for gracefully shutting down the container. Finally, we examine that when the images are run in this manner, the data is not persisted to disk.</em></p><p><strong>How to use Docker Volumes to Persist Data</strong></p><p><em>In the previous tutorial we were able to run an image in a docker container. The docker container provided a RW memory for our project and also for our sqlite database file. And, we noticed that although the app was running fine, yet the data was not persisting between restarts of the container - it was not getting commited to a persistent store. Whenever we closed and restarted the app we found that the sqlite database started blank, with no data. In this tutorial we shall learn how to attach a virtual disk (or a volume) to your container so that data can persist on your hard disk, so that the data remains available on the next start of the container.</em></p><p><strong>How to Publish a Docker Image to DockerHub Registry with Visual Studio</strong></p><p><em>This is a walkthrough on uploading a docker image to the docker hub registry. We shall upload the same hellodocker project and then verify the uploaded image by visiting the docker hub portal.</em></p><p><strong>How to Pull and run MS SQL Server Image in Docker Desktop</strong></p><p><em>In this tutorial we shall learn how to pull and run the docker image of Microsoft SQL Server through the Docker Desktop program. In this same tutorial we shall establish a connection to this instance with the Visual Studio SQL Server Object Explorer.</em></p><p><strong>Connectivity to SQL Server Running in a Docker Container</strong></p><p><em>In this tutorial we shall learn how to connect an ASP.NET Core application to a SQL Server image that is running inside a docker container. </em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>☞Ch13 - DATABASE&nbsp;MIGRATIONS</strong></p><p><strong>What are Database Migrations, Configuring Visual Studio for Database Migration, Getting Started with your first EF Core Migration, Migration on Alterations to a Mod&amp;a</strong></p>",

It will have you questioning everything you&#039;ve been told about what web development is supposed to be and unlock a productivity gain you only get a few times in your career.</p><p style=\"\">Learning Firebase will teach you how to develop fully featured real-time applications using Firebase in the friendliest and most intuitive way possible, by walking through examples using the Firebase dashboard and API.</p><p style=\"\">From the word go you will start to craft a sophisticated real-time link sharing application as a means of applying Firebase concepts exactly as they would be for any other viable application. You will be introduced to the amazing real-time data browser, which you will use extensively throughout the course, as you go hands on with the most important features of Firebase. As you move ahead you&#039;ll learn how to create, read, update, and delete data. You&#039;ll also become familiar with adding and managing user accounts, securing your data, and unlocking its full potential. You&#039;ll apply the knowledge gained to your own application to solidify the concepts and be inspired to explore topics beyond the scope of this course.</p><p style=\"\">By the end of the course, you will have created a full-blown real-time app and be rest assured that it will be the first of many to come!</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">About The Author</strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Mark Nutter </strong>is a Minneapolis-based software engineer and the father of two lovely girls.

  "description": "<p>If you’re looking to learn pure JavaScript and become a <strong>Frontend Developer / JavaScript Developer</strong>, this course is for you.</p><p>You’ll learn complete JavaScript from scratch, including data types, variables, functions, classes and basic principles that will help you navigate other programming languages in the future. You’ll learn how to interact with the DOM, modify the HTML elements using JavaScript and even set up events, so that when you click, for example, a button, a custom function that you’ll write gets executed. Also, you’ll learn how to create and structure your projects using modern design patterns that are an industry standard. But most importantly, you’ll have a better understanding of how vanilla JavaScript works, so that when you decide in the future to pursue frameworks like React and Angular, you’ll know exactly how and where to fix your bugs and mistakes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Course Walkthrough:</strong></p><ul><li><p>We’ll start off with the basics of JavaScript, like what data types there are, how to declare and use variables, and write functions without repeating code for efficiency. </p><p><br></p></li><li><p>Then, we’ll move on to DOM Manipulation, how to directly change HTML attributes of elements through JavaScript, and we’ll use events to pass data into our code from the UI. </p><p><br></p></li><li><p>After that, we’ll continue to Object Oriented Programming, we’ll cover what are classes and how to create objects from them which we’ll use to store the data we receive from the UI. </p><p><br></p></li><li><p>Next, we’ll move on to Asynchronous JavaScript, how to make HTTP calls to a server and retrieve data without interrupting the UI. </p><p><br></p></li><li><p>We’ll then move on to Error Handling, using that for handling any errors we might encounter while performing actions like retrieving data from HTTP calls, also Regular Expressions for form validation such as a valid email address or password, full name, etc. and we’ll conclude this section with Local Storage, how to store data that we need to persist in the browser’s storage. </p><p><br></p></li><li><p>In the next section, we’ll cover Anonymous and Lambda Functions, how to use them as callback functions and how they work. </p><p><br></p></li><li><p>Lastly, we’ll finish off with popular JavaScript patterns, how to identify and learn them to code more efficiently in JavaScript in the future.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>The course is for anyone</strong> with the desire for learning new useful skills, for <strong>beginners</strong> interested in learning web development, or for people who are already familiar with Html and Css and are looking to expand their skills to JavaScript. There are also people who are already skilled at JavaScript, and perhaps they’d like to refresh their knowledge and maybe learn stuff they might’ve not known before. The awesome thing is, <strong>you don’t have to have any prior knowledge of HTML or CSS or even programming for that matter</strong>, because we’ll discuss all of that in the course.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to my course <strong>Beginning .NET Core MVC, Razor, API, Blazor, Azure, Identity</strong>.</p><p>As the title of the course suggests, this is a course for beginners who want to start Web Development with ASP.NET CORE.</p><p>But .NET Core Framework is a vast and complex environment with many different technologies. The goal of this course is to get you started with several of those technologies.</p><p>Throughout the course we will create a simple Database driven project using several different ASP.NET&nbsp;Core technologies. We'll use <strong>MVC Pattern, Web API and API Client that will consume the API, then Razor Pages, Blazor, and also Azure</strong>. Each project will use <strong>Entity Framework Core</strong> for database access. We will use local server installed with Visual Studio, however, in the last project we will also <strong>create and deploy Azure SQL Database</strong>, as well as the web app we created. Throughout the course, we'll be using the well-known <strong>NorthWind Database</strong>. I will show you how to install it on your local server, and later on Azure.</p><p>The structure of this course is different than what you may be familiar with. We will create the exact same project with each of the technology. That’s because the goal of this course isn’t to integrate all the technologies into one project, but to give you a good overview of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. And that is best done by creating the same project with each individual technology because that allows you to compare how each of the technologies works side by side.</p><p>But wouldn’t creating the same project over and over be quite a boring experience? I promise it won’t be. Even though the project remains the same for each technology, I packed each implementation with different ways of doing things. For example, we’ll be using different approach to CRUD operations. In one project we’ll use<strong> LINQ queries</strong>, in another we’ll use <strong>SQL statements</strong>, we’ll also use <strong>SQL Stored Procedures</strong>, and also <strong>SQL Client Object Model</strong>. We’ll also implement Repository pattern, and <strong>add .Net Core Identity to each implementation</strong>. We will use Local Server, but also Azure SQL Database. And of course, each technology and requires different approach with different structure for the whole application. So no, it won't be boring, quite the opposite!</p><p>So why to take my course? You see, a typical ASP.Net Core course shows you lots of different concepts by building a single big project. You start with empty template and several hours later you have a finished project with lot of advanced concepts, and technologies. And for some students, this works fine. But a typical beginner usually gets lost half way as the sheer amount of concepts and technologies presented in such course is way too everywhelming. You find yourself mindlessly coding along the instructor, only to realize at the end, that you don’t remember any of the concepts presented at the earlier lessons.</p><p>Like I said, the structure of my course is very different. My goal is to not only present the concepts, but also re-enforce them throughout the course. This course is all about .Net Core technologies. This way we can truly concentrate on mastering the ASP.Net Core framework and concepts. So by the end of the course, not only you will remember all the essential knowledge and skills, but you will also understand and remember the more advanced ones as they are introduced slowly, thoughtfully, and in step-by step way.</p><p>So get excited to learn a lot of new material and dive into the world of .Net Core. The course makes the learning easy with the mix of introduction of new material, and practical coding! Every step is explained every time to make each project easy to follow. </p><p>See you in the course!</p><p>Let's code!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>WPF</strong> (Windows Presentation Foundation) is for building aesthetic applications with very advanced Look and feel features. The WPF engine is responsible for creating, displaying and manipulating user-interfaces, documents, images, movies and media in <strong>”Rich UI Windows Applications”</strong>. It replaces Winform API which was traditionally used for developing GUI in windows based application. The architecture used for development is very much inspired from ASP.NET WebForms where design (in XAML file) is separated from code (in .cs file). This is the reason the design can be independently created in some tool like Microsoft Expression Blend and coding can be done using Visual Studio IDE.</p>\n\n<p>BestDotNetTraining’s <strong>WPF Online Training</strong> covers all aspects of WPF right from basic controls to layouts to themes to manage 3D drawing and animation which will help one to build Windows 8 and MS Word 2013 kind of Look and feel for the applications. <strong>Mr. Sandeep Soni, MCPD</strong> has ensured that all the topics are covered in maximum possible depth. Special focus is put on WPF Data binding which is the most important topic in building data centric applications.</p>\n\n<p>This WPF training course explains every topic with relevant walkthroughs and sample programs. For each and every module we have provided the compressed form of project developed while explaining the concept in video.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the course. </p><p>This course is about how to build a search engine friendly website or application using Vue.js with Nuxt.js (Updated for Nuxt v2).</p><p>We'll have <strong>search engine friendly features</strong> and improved perfomarnce by using Nuxt.js which is a Vue framework. </p><p>This is because Nuxt pre-renders the code and only delivers mostly the things required on the client side, which is the browser.</p><p>The other major part of the course is Firebase. We'll use it as the database for this course.</p><p>We'll be learning how to structure the database, it's security rules, file storage and of course queries to work with data.</p><p>So, this course is also a <strong>good primer on Firebase</strong> that will help you learn simple to reasonably complex Firebase queries.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a course where you would <strong>learn by building an app</strong>. </p><p>We'll build a simple ecommerce app with product and user management and role based access.</p><p>Then there is a product catalog and shopping cart on the front end.</p><p>At the end of the course you'll have a <strong>working app boiler plate</strong> that you could use for your own projects.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a jump-start course. So, it's about getting you <strong>up and running quickly</strong>. And it's not about long and winding explanation of everything. </p><p>We'll just do some work and then look at the result so that <strong>we learn by doing</strong>. </p><p>At the end of the course you'll receive the source code of the app we built.</p><p>So, I wish you good luck and let's get started.  ;)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

This is an extremely important part of the process, as it will lay the groundwork for the success of your blog in days and weeks to come. Create a fashion blog you are passionate about, which we will help you discover. Find a passion that will also make you earn in the process. Since we already are going to be focusing on a \"fashion\" concept, it's just a matter of finding which direction and content topic you want to go after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you decide on your fashion blogging niche the second thing it that choose a unique but effective <strong>domain name for your blog website</strong>. I will walk you through the process of choosing a great domain name for your blog website. Make sure you come up with an original domain that represents the content on your site, but also making sure it's something that is easy to remember and spell in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After choosing a domain name, it's time is to go live with your fashion blog.

There are many ways to reach traffic on the internet today, but I'm going to only focus on four methods that I continue to use today -- these are SEO, guest blogging, infographics and social media. I will also show you the <strong>best ways to make money</strong> from your blog.

  "description": "<p>Java\nEnterprise isn’t one of the easiest platforms to work with,\nespecially when it comes with a number of different confusing\nparadigms and jargons – JDBC, JTA, JAX, MVC, Hibernate, etc. to\nname a few. Add other technologies such as MySQL and Struts,  you’re\nbound to leave someone more confused than what they started with. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Common\ncourses often leave user with the basics, such as creating a simple\napplication and you are okay. You can follow along with the\ninstructor and finish the project and then replicate it, but the\nmoment you are asked to modify the application for real-world use and\nyou won’t know what to do? How to fix the errors or even what the\npop up error means?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This\nis why we have designed this comprehensive course. The main aim of\nthis Java EE tutorial is to help you gain real world practical\napplication of Java Enterprise. This course will show you exactly how\nto deviate from the theory to actual learning how to start building\nyour own applications. Using a project-based approach,  you’ll not\nonly follow the instructor, but you’ll also learn why, how in\naddition to simply what. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Before\nwe delve into the course details further, let’s take a quick look\nat what Java Enterprise actually is. Java Enterprise is a set of\nspecifications that extend the Java SE platform and allows developers\nto build scalable applications that can handle transactions,\nsecurity, concurrency, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Now,\nlet’s take a look at what you’ll learn in this course. This\ncourse will focus on Java EE by building 5 different projects that\nwill help you breakdown the Java EE platform and also understand\nexactly how you will build applications using it. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As\nthe course progresses, you’ll learn from the different errors that\npop up, what they mean and how to resolve them. You’ll also learn\nother technologies such as Spring Boot, Hibernate, Spring Data,\nBoiler Plate Codes, Serverlets, JDBC libraries, MySQL databases,\nStruts, and so much more. The five projects will help you understand\nexactly how to configure the platform and also write boiler plate\ncodes to help you design the projects. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The\n5 projects that you’ll cover in this course:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project\n1: Voting System –</strong> In this project, you’ll work with the\nSpring Boot, Spring Data and Hibernate, also learn how to write very\nlittle boiler plate code.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project\n2: Complaint Manager –</strong> This project will show you how to\nconfigure Spring MVC and will go over the important boiler plate\ncodes that you need. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project\n3: Job Portal –</strong> In this project, everything will be low-level\nand the major focus will be on servlets and JSPs. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project\n4: Social Network –</strong><strong> </strong>In this project we will be using the\nStruts framework and how to utilize the Struts code.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project\n5: Task Manager –</strong> This project will include the Vaadin\nframework that works well with large applications.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So,\nwhat are you waiting for? Enroll now and let’s get started on your\nnext Java Application!</p>",

I will also take you through  the lifecycle of components . You will be transpiling JSX code using babel which is an in browser transpiler that converts  JSX code into readable format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you will learn includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is React.js?<br>Who uses  React<br>Adding and accessing React Library<br>Adding and accessing React DOM Library<br>Adding and accessing Babel compiler<br>Using JSX<br>Creating a React component<br>Using props<br>Prop Types<br>Using props with children<br>Working with state<br>Handling events<br>Using Refs<br>Mounting components<br>Un-Mounting Components<br>Updating Components<br>Creating a React App</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>This is a practical hands-on course and i encourage you to follow along as much as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Thank you and welcome to the course.</p>",

Presentation rate starts slow and is very thorough in establishing a consistent presentation of new material.

The course definitely delivers and the instructor is outstanding.” –</em><strong>Don Ricardo</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong> </strong>★★★★★<em> “Starts at a basic introductory level and slowly works its way up to advanced HTML and CSS concepts using clear examples.

I recommend it highly.” -</em><strong>Mario Chiara</strong>\n\n  </p>",

  "description": "<p>So, you have reached at a point to implement Odoo not in the default standard way.. Where your Odoo implementation has required many instances running in parallel and can't be handled with a single or two servers anymore.. And the decision is to utilize Docker, as it can be scaled and managed easily as the client request increased dramatically.</p><p>Then, this course is for you..</p><p>Docker will reduce the complexity of implementing a software system that requires many supporting subsystems, libraries, external program, where sometimes a small difference of minor version or setting can cause the whole system failed to work.</p><p>Docker will solve the ‘it works in my laptop’ problem we commonly face while working with developers.</p><p>I will teach you how to start creating your custom Odoo Docker Image, begins with running the official one that we got from Odoo, then tweak it to suit your needs and start generating your custom image. Direct to the point, not that much theory.</p><p>Then I will also teach you how to integrate your custom image to a Github repository (Gitlab works as well), so that every commit to the repository will automatically create a new image version..</p><p>Or, when you need to pull the repository on every docker container restart..</p><p>Or, when you need to clone the repository on every docker container restart..</p><p>I will teach you all of those practical things step by step, no need for any prior knowledge of Docker, just a little bit of Linux standard commands.</p><p>Please also check my other course on how to manage the docker containers in Kubernetes environment to achieve the autoscaling and zero downtime for our Odoo instances.</p><p>Hope you find this course useful for you daily jobs.</p><p>See you soon on the class!</p>",

  "description": "<p>So maybe you tried out Ruby on Rails, but found it too hard and feel that you need a more comprehensive introduction.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you have worked a bit with Ruby and want to further your skills with the language and learn web development with it and Rails.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps your boss or client threw you in the deep end with a Ruby on Rails project, and you need to learn about Rails fast?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe you just decided you would like to add Web development and Ruby on Rails to your resume to give yourself some better opportunities.\n\n \n\n If so, you are in the right place.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is going to teach you how to create web applications using Ruby on Rails. . \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why Ruby on Rails?</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Ruby on Rails is a super fast and productive way to develop web applications.   It simplifies common repetitive tasks that take a long time to create in other languages.  The framework is mature because it has been built on solid foundations.  It's much easier to get a high-end product completed in Ruby on Rails than in other languages.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Because it's mature there is a ton of open source projects/code you can use that are extremely powerful and really give you an advantage in build solid web applications.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Plus it uses the Ruby programming language. Ruby programming code reads like English and that makes it a lot easier to understand if you are just starting out as a programmer.  As a dynamically typed language, Ruby does not have all of those hard rules other languages do, and in many respects is similar to spoken languages. This empowers you by giving you flexibility to solve problems in a more human way than other programming languages.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is covered?</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the features covered in the course include...\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Git Basics, Rails core \"7 methods\", and how they perform \"CRUD\", Rails Routing, Strong Parameters, Custom Callbacks, Custom Validation, Partials,<br>Bootstrap 4, Rails Generators, User Autorization, User Authentication, Content Management, Deployment, Seeding the Database, Sending/Receiving Email using a Rails Application, Configuring Sidekiq, Configuring Redis on Heroku and a private server, Installing Templates, Custom Validation Messages, Adding Assets to the Rails Pipeline, Uploading Images on your own server, Uploads to AWS, Adding a WYSIWYG - What You See Is What You Get Editor and more!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why enrolling in this course is the best decision you can make.</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This courses uses non complicated examples to do complex things.  The goal is to get you to understand exactly what you are doing and the reasons why, rather than typing in code you don't understand. No code is glossed over, as it is important for you to understand what each line is doing.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Your instructor, Stephen Chesnowitz became a fan of Ruby and Ruby on Rails back in 2012 and dove in head first. Over the years he has worked on some pretty cool projects, and is here to share what he can and help you along your path into the world of web development using Ruby on Rails.\n\n \n\n As a result you are dealing with someone who not only knows the Ruby language and Ruby on Rails really well, but has the skills to teach things in a way that anyone can understand.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>After completing this course, you will have the necessary skills to be able to create your own web applications using Ruby on Rails.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The sooner you sign up for this course, the sooner you will have the skills and knowledge you need to increase your job or consulting opportunities.    Ruby on Rails developers are in high demand!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Your new job or consulting opportunity awaits!  \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Why not get started today?\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> Click the <strong>Signup</strong> button to sign up for the course!\n\n  </p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to this<strong> Cheetah Academy</strong> training course. I hope that it will be a beneficial course for you and you will learn a lot from it and, as a result, improve your programming skills. This course aims to help people who are beginners in Front-End Web Development, do not have an acceptable portfolio to offer, or can not create a final product. In this training course, we intend to teach you the following items:</p><ol><li><p>Improving your skills and taking a few steps to be professional.</p></li><li><p>Helping you learn the basic skills to create a valuable product.</p></li><li><p>Assisting you in creating a good and presentable portfolio.</p></li></ol><p>If you know the basics of HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Bootstrap5, and JavaScript, but you do not know how to use them to create a personal website, this course will help you. This course will teach you how to create a personal website using HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Bootstrap5, and JavaScript. The following is the role of each of the tools, libraries, programming languages, and frameworks:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is Figma's role in this tutorial?</strong></p><p>First, the website should be created using graphic applications such as Photoshop, Sketch, Adobe xd, and Figma. Then it will be coded by a Front-End Web Developer using languages, libraries, and web frameworks like HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Bootstrap5, JavaScript, jQuery, Vue.js, React, and Angular to become a static website. All components, colors, font sizes, margins, paddings, etc., are determined by Figma, and you must extract these values from the Figma file and convert them to code. In this course, we will turn a template implemented in Figma into a beautiful website, and you will learn how to extract photos, colors, font sizes, etc., from Figma.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is HTML5’s role in this tutorial?</strong></p><p>Most websites are now HTML-based, and it is the basis of today's websites and web applications. Semantic tags such as MAIN, SECTION, HEADER, FOOTER, and ASIDE have been added to the last version of this language to differentiate sections of a website, called HTML5. It had been done by the DIV tag already, and the website's page had been divided into different sections, and these DIV tags were distinguished using CLASS and ID.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is the CSS3’s role in this tutorial?</strong></p><p>HTML without CSS has no visual attractiveness, and you should use CSS to give a website color, glaze, and beauty. In this tutorial, we will use the third version of CSS called CSS3. In this version, many attractive features such as transition, animation, embedded fonts, and shadows have been added, by which you can make a website more attractive. This course uses CSS3 features extensively to improve your CSS3 knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is the SASS’s role in this tutorial?</strong></p><p>When we work with CSS, we can write CSS code faster using a special tool called SASS. SASS is a preprocessor for CSS and includes features such as variables, nesting, and inheritance to speed up the writing of CSS code. The browsers do not understand SASS codes, so when we write these codes, they are converted to CSS by a compiler to be understandable for the browsers. In this course, you will learn to work with SASS practically, improving your skill in SASS. Today, Front-End Web Developers should have the ability to work with a CSS preprocessor in their list skills.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is Bootstrap5’s role in this tutorial?</strong></p><p>When you create a website using HTML and CSS, you should create it responsive to make it visible properly on various devices such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and monitors with different dimensions. You can use media queries to do this, but an easier way is to use Bootstrap, which has a premade grid structure built in if you follow Bootstrap rules. Therefore, you will have a responsive website that displays well on different devices with different dimensions. When we recorded this tutorial, the latest version of Bootstrap was the fifth version, Bootstrap5. In this version, like the previous version, flex is used to create grids, and it has almost the same features as Bootstrap4 with minor changes. The most significant change is the removal of jQuery; in contrast, raw JavaScript has been employed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is JavaScript’s role in this tutorial?</strong></p><p>The most popular programming language globally is JavaScript, and in this course, we will utilize JavaScript. We want to improve your JavaScript skills; the more you watch and practice this course, the more you practically learn JavaScript skills. We will not use jQuery and its plugins in this course because we want you to learn raw JavaScript. As you know, JavaScript is the basis of all JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, React, Vue.js, Angular, and Svelte, so if you want to learn any of these libraries and frameworks, you should first learn JavaScript sufficiently. We want to improve your JavaScript skills because we believe JavaScript is the heart of the Front-End!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>What are the features of this website?</strong></p><ol><li><p>This website has two dark and light modes; by clicking on a button, the website theme goes from dark to light and vice versa using JavaScript.</p></li><li><p>Meteor shower animation is included on this website.</p></li><li><p>Existence of a biography section to show critical skills, foreign languages, programming skills, years of experience in each field, and display other information.</p></li><li><p>Ability to display educational background and work experience in the resume section.</p></li><li><p>View the portfolio and details of each portfolio in the portfolio section</p></li><li><p>Display customer feedback in the Testimonial section</p></li><li><p>Personal resume download link</p></li><li><p>Personal social network links</p></li></ol><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Welcome to my Basic course on Java Programming with NetBeans!</strong></p><p>My name is Matthew Dewey. I am an experienced programmer, having received several accommodations on programming in my formal education as well as tough several programming languages to thousands of students. My goal is to provide you, the budding programmer, the the knowledge you need on programming in an easy and fun manner. In this course I do just that and with one of the most useful IDEs coupled with the Java programming language.</p><p>Java, a wonderfully simple programming language that has encouraged many programmers to pursue careers involving Java over any other language. Of course, it goes without saying that Java is an excellent language, but do you know what is required of you to start programming Java?</p><p>As with any programming language it is important you understand the fundamentals and that is exactly what I teach you in this course. Further on, once completing the basic section, we move onto advanced Java programming and OOP. Data is important in the technological world that we live in, but what we use is processed data, so you, as the budding programmer need to know this as well. I show you how to scan through large amounts of data with ease as well as extract specific types and process it as well.</p><p><strong>What about NetBeans?</strong> A popular, widely used IDE that many large applications have been created in over the years. Do you know how to use it to its full potential? Well, in this course we will go through several projects that will help you get truly comfortable with the IDE as well as more adept at program creation.</p><p><br></p><p>I help you:</p><ul><li><p>Install your IDE</p></li><li><p>Establish fundamental code</p></li><li><p>Create and use variables</p></li><li><p>Retrieve user input</p></li><li><p>Process simple data</p></li><li><p>Advanced Java Methods</p></li><li><p>Data Collection</p></li><li><p>Data Processing and Storage</p></li><li><p>Data Extraction</p></li><li><p>Data Scanning</p></li><li><p>OOP, Object Orientated Programming</p></li><li><p>and BONUS tips and tricks!</p></li><li><p><br></p></li></ul><p>Go no further if you're looking for the course that will guide you into the world of programming! With my masterclass course I can guarantee that the knowledge you learn will help you get a head-start in Java programming. I hope you enjoy the course and it helps you on your way into the world of programming!</p><p><em>\"Programming is a form of art. It is logical creativity!\"</em></p>",

  "description": "<p>Drupal is one of the most popular web content management systems on the planet and offers an incredible array of features and functionality. Small nonprofits and businesses to multi-billion dollar multinational companies are all using Drupal as the core of their presence on the web. Drupal 8 brings a lot of groundbreaking changes to its ecosystem, from basic architectural to functional. Understanding these changes is vital to you if you are trying to explore Drupal 8 and become a qualified Drupal 8 professional. Drupal will help you build your skill level from ground level up and enable you to create an efficient Drupal 8 application from scratch. <strong><em>If you're interested to build a fully featured, multilingual, responsive web application with Drupal 8, then go for this Learning Path.</em></strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Packt’s Video Learning Paths are a series of individual video products put together in a logical and stepwise manner such that each video builds on the skills learned in the video before it.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The highlights of this Learning Path are: </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Explore the world of various views and components in Drupal 8\n\n  </li><li>Understand how to test, deploy and monitor your application\n\n  </li><li>Leverage Drupal 8's mobile-first philosophy to make your website accessible on any device\n\n  </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This practical step-by-step Learning Path will ensure that you build a stunning, fully-featured, multilingual, and responsive web-application with Drupal 8.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a quick look at your learning journey…\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll start off with the primary focal points of Drupal 8’s key features and its importance. Then, you’ll start building your Drupal 8 app, create the application architecture, and use Drupal 8’s views and components extensively. You’ll learn how to create reusable templates using PHP scripting, use plugins, and develop simple plugins on your own. You’ll explore the use of views module (now part of core!) and other contributed modules to add a bit of customization to the site. You’ll also create a new functionality of your own, including providing REST web services. Finally, you’ll take a brief look at how to create a mobile-friendly theme that ensures anybody on any device can take advantage of the amazing site you’ve built.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>By the end of this Learning Path, you'll have acquired core components of Drupal 8 to test, deploy, and monitor your fully-featured, multilingual application effectively with no custom coding.</em></strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Meet Your Expert:</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have the best work of the following esteemed author to ensure that your learning journey is smooth:</p><ul><li><strong>Jason Blanda</strong>has been professionally developing and deploying websites using the Drupal content management system for over 7 years. He runs the One Stop How to Guys YouTube channel, offering a wide variety of free educational courses including but not limited to Drupal 8. He is the Co-Founder and CEO of Arch board Media, a website development company in Canton, Ohio, building websites and web apps on the Drupal content management system.</li><li>In a prior lifetime, <strong>Marc Isaacson</strong> was an AS/400 RPG application developer. He left the programming field entirely in 2001 to pursue other interests, including teaching High School math. Marc first fell in love with Drupal in 2008 when he was playing around with creating websites for his own projects. At the time, he didn't have any intention of returning to the programming field; Drupal was just a tool that helped him to get the job done. After a series of life events conspired to bring him back to programming, he decided to teach himself to be a web developer. Naturally, he chose Drupal as the tool to learn. Marc started building websites for clients in 2010 and now specializes in using Drupal as a framework to build custom web applications. Marc has attended and presented at many Drupal camps, including DrupalCamp Colorado and BADCamp. He has also attended every North American DrupalCon since DrupalCon Denver in 2012. His first time acting as a Core Sprint Mentor was at DrupalCon New Orleans in 2016.</li></ul>",

They follow a code-along tutorial but then inevitably are stuck forever and give up when the instructor doesn’t answer their question.</p><p>If you ever ran into a broken application and no idea what to do, and struggled to find help.. This course is for you!</p><p>Introducing our new course:</p><p><strong>React Beginner Challenges - 25 Debugging Exercises</strong></p><p>Unlike our other courses, here we do not rush into building an application. Instead, we first review a complete guide to debugging React and JavaScript applications.</p><p>By “complete\" debugging strategy, we mean that seriously. Every tool or skill that you need to debug frontend applications is found in this course:</p><ul><li><p>Find and fix source code with a full overview of Chrome DevTools</p></li><li><p>Understand how to track down where error messages come from and what they mean</p></li><li><p>How to examine the state of your React app from any point in your app</p></li><li><p>Easily find and research any JavaScript or React library</p></li><li><p>How to debug Material UI, Redux, charting libraries, and more</p></li></ul><p>Best of all, in this course, we created 25 debugging exercises to test your skills. Each exercise comes with its own CodeSandbox link so you can jump into debugging for yourself. So you don’t need to install anything to run the exercises in this course.</p><p><strong>I’m confident that if you take even half of this course, you will stop struggling with bugs and focus on actually building applications!</strong></p><p>Note: This course assumes you already know some very basic information about React. It shouldn't be your very first React tutorial. It's ideal for beginners who have just started out and are either stuck or struggling with a project.</p><p><strong>Access 25 Debugging Challenges with complete video solution tutorials</strong></p><p>With these 25 bugs, you'll get more than enough practice solving real-world issues.</p><p><strong>Eliminate your fear of React errors and bugs!</strong></p>",

It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.</p><p><strong>Why is JavaScript important?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development.</p><p><strong>What are the main uses of JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used for client- and server-side development. Web developers have used JavaScript since its inception to add simple interactivity to web pages like modals, animated elements, or image slideshows. While that is still one of its primary uses, Javascript has evolved to building complete web applications. SPAs, or single page applications, depend on JavaScript-based frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue to bring a desktop-like application experience to the browser. However, it's important to note that web browsers aren't places that make good use of the programming language. Javascript is also popular for building web services and back-end infrastructure with Node.js. React Native, Xamarin, Ionic, and NativeScript frameworks use JavaScript for developing phone apps as well.</p><p><strong>React vs. Angular vs. Vue: what is the best JavaScript framework?</strong></p><p>Choosing the best JavaScript framework for your web project depends on what you are looking for. React is a popular framework, which means you will find a lot of community support if you need help. It is also considered relatively easy to learn but is being developed at a rapid pace. Angular is a framework that makes data binding easy so that you can template an application faster. It also uses the RxJS library to simplify asynchronous programming and Typescript (which compiles to JavaScript) for a cleaner, less error-prone development process. Some cons of Angular are that it can have a steep learning curve and can be complex. Vue is a lightweight framework, so it is easy to learn, very performant, and flexible. Some cons of Vue are limited plugins, and its flexibility can lead to irregular code.</p><p><strong>What is Angular and what are its benefits?</strong></p><p>Angular is an open-source, client-side framework for building single-page websites and desktop and mobile applications. It is a full-featured JavaScript application built on TypeScript, which operates across platforms and keeps code clean and consistent throughout the codebase. Angular is an all-in-one rapid application development platform that allows web pages to render efficiently by minimizing communication with servers. The Angular framework offers end-to-end tooling or routing, state management, and form validation, as well as dependency injection and declarative templates. Angular offers out-of-the-box functionality and easy updating, along with an extensive collection of pre-made components. The TypeScript base includes high-quality code that reduces the burden of debugging and allows multiple developers to collaborate across platforms with minimal disruption and less coding.</p><p><strong>Is learning Angular hard?</strong></p><p>Angular is a complex application that contains multiple libraries and cross-platform functionalities, so it can take some time to learn its many features. Angular’s learning curve depends partly on your previous knowledge of web development and your familiarity with the languages used in the Angular platform. If you’re new to Angular, it’s helpful to have some familiarity with the basics of web design and the essentials of HTML and CSS. It’s also useful to know about the other languages that make up the Angular framework. These include basic HTML and CSS, as well as ECMAScript6, or ES6, a general programming language designed to ensure interoperability of web pages across the Internet. It’s also helpful to understand TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript used to write Angular. Learning Angular is even easier if you’re familiar with JavaScript, which is an implementation of ES6 and Angular’s base language.</p><p><strong>What is Angular used for?</strong></p><p>Developers mainly use Angular to build dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) for web, mobile, and desktop. SPAs are web pages based on a single HTML file that is completely controlled by JavaScript. When an action such as clicking a button happens on the page, the code renders it on the page instantly without sending a new request to the server. TypeScript and Angular’s other tools, including routing, state management, and ROM validation, make SPA creation easy and fast. Its open-source JavaScript framework allows developers to reuse code across multiple platforms. Angular’s component-based architecture simplifies the development workflow, making it possible to design apps for deployment in a wide range of environments and update them without extensive recoding.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Angular and React?</strong></p><p>Angular and React are both rapid application development (RAD) platforms based on JavaScript. Angular is a multilayered framework that runs on Typescript and is compatible with many different code editors. It is a full-featured web development platform that requires no additional libraries. This means Angular can independently carry out a full range of development functions such as data binding, form validation, and dependency injection. First introduced in 2013, React is a JavaScript library managed by Facebook, and it works for both single- and multi-page web applications. React is a framework for UI development that’s smaller and faster than Angular. However, it requires other libraries or modules to provide the full range of Angular’s functions. React is easy to install and use for anyone who already knows JavaScript, and because it operates with a virtual DOM, the browser load reduces. Angular operates with a real DOM, which leads to longer runtimes and slower performance.</p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience. </p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p></li></ul><p><strong> You'll also get:</strong></p><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p><p>Dive in now to our&nbsp;<strong>JavaScript &amp; Angular with Hands-on Examples</strong> course</p><p>We offer&nbsp;<strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Latest Update:</strong><br><strong>March 9, 2017</strong> - Please note that import io is no longer a free program. They just recently started to charge for use of the platform. I would love some feedback about whether to keep the tutorials up for this portion or to remove and add more lessons from Python, Scrapy and/or Ruby. </p>\n\n<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You'll be web scraping in less than an hour!!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This course teaches you three ways to scrape websites:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Import. io is a software that you download and is a really quick way to start web scraping quickly. It is not without its limitations but depending on what you need or plan to do it could do everything you need. <strong>No programming experience necessary!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer to learn a little programming along the way, and aren't afraid to invest a little time, you can learn how to do web scraping with Ruby and/or Python. Both have their pluses and minuses but both can do just about anything you could imagine. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you have never used Python or Ruby you can learn how to still use these programs as a web scraper. But if you are willing to learn you can scrape just about any website there is online!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Want to do some web scraping of super popular websites? That's how you will learn!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This course comes complete with code for every lecture for Ruby and Python!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You will learn to web scrape popular websites like:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Zillow</li><li>Craigslist</li><li>Yelp</li><li>IMDB</li><li>Wikipedia</li><li>Google</li><li>Macys</li><li>YouTube</li><li>NFL</li><li>Nordstrom</li><li>Wal-Mart</li><li>Twitter</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will learn to install Python and Ruby. You'll learn how to download what you web scrape into CSV files and with Python you will learn how to put your data into a database.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Other lessons include how to get around obstacles such as websites with ajax that load content dynamically. You'll also learn how to crawl multiple pages of websites and get all the data you need!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>With Import. io you will learn how to download a website that has over 40,000 products on it. Yes, 40,000 products and you will learn how to scrape all of those products. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Stop imagining you can grab data off websites and use them for your next web project, you an do it now. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Please note: Software installation can be done for both Mac OSX and Windows. I use a Mac so it is more focused on OSX however instructions are available for Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update: January 17, 2016 </strong>- Added three Scrapy videos. How to setup scrapy and scraping Craigslist<br><strong>Update: October 17, 2015 </strong>- Added Bonus lesson on extracting zip codes from Yelp<br><strong>Update: September 15, 2015 - </strong>Added How to find JSON and scrape it on Walmart<br><strong>Updated: September 1, 2015</strong> - Three new Twitter API scraper videos. How to scrape user tweets, users searching for keywords and how to follow those users through Ruby/Twitter API<br><strong>Update: August 28, 2015</strong> - Added Wikipedia scraper and map<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Enroll now!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to this Full stack advance course. This course is mainly based on <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>React</strong> advanced features. We will build full applications including backend restful API and front-end web app.</p><p>In this tutorial, we will build a real-life application. This course it’s a process of building the app. It's not gonna be one of those 'todo lists' or simple 'full crud' apps. We will start building that from scratch and we end up with a fully working full-stack app. Building that application will give an opportunity to explain a ton of different concepts and technics for back-end Django and front-end React.</p><p>We will cover so many things in this course that it's hard to list all of them. But let me give it a try. we will do:</p><p>setting up Django and React, working with DB models and migrations, Django admin, fetching data from front-end, displaying formatted data, styling with material UI library, creating layouts, CSS variables, theming, react-router, links, and navigation with history, URL params, creating custom services, working with build-in React hooks as well writing few of our own, multiple serializers for one model, nested serializers, working with dates and time, formating and converting dates to and from UTC, displaying icons, styling components, authentication token, user profile, login, logout, and register users, react context, local storage, uploading a photo from react to Django, handling static and media files in Django, React Prop types, change a user password, user notifications, permissions, one to one, one to many and many to many relationships in DB, serializer method field, join and leave groups, the comments section in UI, custom API endpoints, UI forms with multiple different elements, DB aggregation in Django</p><p>...and many many more.</p><p>If you have already basic knowledge of Django and React, this course will give you solid knowledge about them in detail. Also, it will provide you many solutions that you can adapt to your own app.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>What Are Responsive Forms?</strong></p><p>Your forms should work on <em>all</em> mobile devices to create a seamless experience for all employees. This means optimizing for Apple, Android and all sized devices, from tablets to smartphones.</p><p>Responsive forms get the job done because they automatically adjust for all devices, screen sizes and orientations.</p><p>Filling this form out on mobile would then require users to scroll and pinch to view all of the information. In fact, had the form not been optimized, it may not have been visible without scrolling since the large image would have crowded it out.</p><p>If you’ve ever tried to fill out a form on a mobile device that isn’t optimized for the mobile experience, you will know how frustrating the process can be. After pinching and scrolling for a while, you may have abandoned the task completely and put it off until you can access a desktop computer.</p><p>Your customers and employees feel the same. Without optimization, they’ll abandon the experience and put it off until they can access their desktops. The greater the user effort and/or confusion, the worse the user experience, which wastes time and lowers productivity.</p><p><strong>Why is Mobile Design so Important for the Modern Workforce?</strong></p><p>Mobile applications and forms have become an important component of the modern workforce.</p><p><strong><em>Create forms that work perfectly for mobile devices with this expert advice.</em></strong></p><p>Whether it is a signup flow or a multi-view stepper, forms are one of the most important components of digital product design – so you need to design them so they work effectively on mobile devices.</p><p>Regardless of the device size, the easiest way to complete a form is in a linear fashion. Multiple columns disrupt a user's momentum (the users are likely to interpret the fields inconsistently, which is a negative factor in terms of usability) and can result in users having to resort to horizontal scrolling.</p><p>When it comes to laying out forms, you should design the entries in one column: if a form is in a single column, the path to completion is a straight line down the page.</p><ul><li><p>The form field won't be wide enough to display the user's entire input, making them more likely to mistype their responses and leading to more erroneous forms being submitted</p></li><li><p>When a user is notified that they have entered erroneous information, they may have a hard time spotting and fixing the problem as they won't be able to see the entire invalid input</p><p><br></p><p>Placing the label above the form field when a user is browsing from a mobile device will ensure users can see the maximum width to input their details, since you don't need to use up any for the label. Writing your labels above the input fields also makes it much easier for you to write clear and meaningful field labels, as you won't be limited to one or two words.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Help and inspiration ?</strong></p><p>Not only do you get a load of practical, useful starting projects in this course, you can also head over to CSS Animation.rocks for more, and even sign up to a weekly newsletter packed full of tutorials, inspiration and tips for animating on the web.</p><p><strong>There’s no better time to learn Animations :&nbsp;</strong>You’ve made a smart choice, because CSS 3 Animations is the most popular language out there. This is no exaggeration. This popularity and growth means more jobs and opportunities than ever before.</p><p><strong>Get access to fast support if you get stuck : </strong>There’s nothing worse than getting stuck ten hours into a course and not getting the help you need to continue. Getting stuck is part of the learning process. That’s why I’m here to answer every single question that comes my way.</p><p>I guarantee that this is the most up-to-date and engaging course available, and it comes with a Udemy 30-day money-back guarantee.</p><p>I can’t wait to see you on the inside !</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- <strong>B.

  "description": "<p><strong>If your goal is to learn JavaScript and get hired, take this course.</strong></p><p>According to the 2018, Hackerrank developer survey, JavaScript is the number one skill that companies are looking for in the tech industry. After all, JavaScript is the language that runs in the browser. And almost every company does business through a web application.</p><p>JavaScript frameworks are also the biggest gap between what employers demand, and what candidates can provide. This is because JavaScript still isn't a part of the core curriculum at many universities. Rising software engineers don't have JavaScript skills unless they learn on their own.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Therefore, according to the statistics, learning JavaScript is smartest choice to increasing your chances of landing a job.</strong></p><p><strong>In addition, this course is going to give you an extra advantage. Throughout the course, there are special interview-question based videos.</strong> These focus on particularly tricky question, that you may get asked about during a JavaScript interview.</p><p><br></p><p>Here's how the course journey will go:</p><ul><li><p><strong>First: the Basics.</strong> You'll ramp on the console, syntax, objects, and other language fundamentals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Second: Functions.</strong> There are a few ways to create functions. So you'll explore those differences, and important concepts like the `this` keyword.</p></li><li><p><strong>Third: Types - Digging Deeper.</strong> There are some big questions about types: what is type coercion? How are truthy and falsy different? What is null vs. undefined? In this section, you'll cover those questions and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fourth: Syntax - the Intricacies.</strong> In this one, you'll discover JavaScript features that can help make your code cleaner. You'll also investigate odd language behavior like hoisting.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fifth: Objects - Deeper Concepts.</strong> This section will introduces more features that can clean up code around objects. The larger topic in this section is a series of videos on creating object clones.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sixth: Functions - Deeper Concepts.</strong> The theme of \"Deeper concepts\" continues. This time, it's functions. In this section, you'll dig into big terms like closures, function factories, and higher-order functions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seventh: Constructors and Prototypes. </strong>This is probably the most crucial section in the course. Exploring prototype-based inheritance is an illuminating experience. You'll discover the<em> </em>\"why\" and \"how\" behind the truth that almost everything is an object in JavaScript.</p></li><li><p><strong>Eighth: Asynchronous code and the JavaScript engine.</strong> This last section will complete the investigation of JavaScript under the hood. You'll track code as it executes through the JavaScript runtime components: the callstack, queue, and event loop.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>The course is meant for all levels. If you start from the beginning, you will learn JavaScript from scratch. But the course is designed to allow intermediate to advanced students to start at later sections, if they see fit. The lessons and interview question videos would benefit anyone, no matter their experience.</p><p>In addition to the interview-question based videos, there are resources like quizzes to help reinforce your learning.</p><p>Overall, the statistics say that investing your time in JavaScript is a wise decision. On top of this, this course is giving you a greater advantage by preparing you for the tough interview questions.</p><p>Ultimately, if your goal is to get hired for your JavaScript skills, then this course will set you on that path!</p>",

So, you will even learn how to create a class, instantiate it and call the methods on the object. </p><p>At last, I will develop a web page where all the knowledge you have acquired during the course will be used to create a complete <strong>CRUD</strong> web page. As a bonus lecture, I will also show you how to code the Live Search mechanism in your webpage where you can perform operations on the database without reloading the page.<br><br>For taking this course, it is would be great if you have the following prerequisites:</p><ul><li><p>Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS</p></li></ul><p>Although there are these prerequisites, I will explain each and every line of code that we are going to write. So, even if you are a complete beginner, you can join in. Just follow along and you will learn a lot.</p><p>After completing this course, you will be able to perform Insert, Delete, Update and Select operations on your database. This will help you in creating backend applications.</p><p>Some examples where you can use this knowledge are:</p><ul><li><p>Creating a to-do application</p></li><li><p>Creating a blog</p></li><li><p>Creating a simple registration system</p></li><li><p>Creating contact form</p></li><li><p>And more…</p></li></ul><p><em>I will you all the best.

  "description": "<p style=\"\">An online community is a great place for people with the same interest to share their thought, experiences and stories with each other. This course will teach you how to build a social network that would allow your members to make friendship connections, to send messages to each other, to share ideas and statuses on a site-wide activity stream, and you will also learn how to create niche-related  groups to make your network even more interesting. You don&#039;t need to have any former experience with Wordpress and/or Buddypress, which are the platforms we will use in this course, since i show you how to use them. </p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Course Structure</strong></p><p style=\"\">The course is built in a &quot;Learn by Watching&quot; way, which is my favourite way of teaching and learning. I simply show you where i click and how i do everything on my screen, so you can see and imitate in your own system. </p><p style=\"\">The course will take about 2 hours to complete and i suggest you watch it on a tablet if you own one, so you can put it besides your computer while you work on your community website. </p><p style=\"\">Here are the steps we will go through in this course:</p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Website hosting - you will need one to get your platform online</li><li style=\"\">Wordpress installation</li><li style=\"\">Adding Wordpress (free) theme</li><li style=\"\">Learn Wordpress basics - content, menus, theme options, plugins, widgets</li><li style=\"\">Buddypress installation and configuration</li><li style=\"\">Network components and how to work with them</li></ul><p style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">What kind of network will i learn to build</strong></span></p><p style=\"\">The network you will build depends on your needs. I will give you all the tools you can use in order to create a network with the most possibilities Buddypress can provide, and it&#039;s yours to take what you need from it. You can build a public community for anyone to join. You can build a secret community for specific people with restricted content to make sure it stays private. You can build a half-public half-private community with the help of groups - where you can decide which ones are public, which ones are restricted and which ones are even hidden from a guest viewer.</p>I will teach you how to work with every component of Buddypress, and you can decide which one you need and want to use. If you don&#039;t want to let your members create friendship connections - you can deactivate this option. If you don&#039;t need groups - don&#039;t use them. If you don&#039;t want your members to be able to communicate through private messages - just don&#039;t allow it. Buddypress is such a flexible platform that you can really fit it to your needs and even change your configurations with a click of a button later on if you decide you want to add/remove a specific component.<p style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Who should take this course?</strong></span></p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Anyone looking for people with a common interest to talk and share thoughts with</li><li style=\"\">Bloggers who want to take their blog to a new level and start an online community where they can engage with their readers</li><li style=\"\">Families who want to keep in touch in a special way - by creating a private family online community where they can share photos, videos and experiences with each other</li><li style=\"\">Businesses who want to raise credibility and connections with their customers by creating a warm space where they can keep in touch with them and talk a bout their products/services</li><li style=\"\">Promoters of a specific product who want to promote it in a unique way and create a social network around it</li><li style=\"\">Group of parents who want to create a convenient place where they can discuss about their children&#039;s activities for example - a community for a sport team, a class, etc.</li><li style=\"\">Group of friends who want to share more than words with each other by creating a (private) online community where they can communicate</li></ul><p style=\"\"><span style=\"\"></span></p><strong style=\"\">Additional Costs</strong>The only additional cost you might have (unless you already have a hosting account) is to the hosting provider. The costs vary from 4$-12$ per month depending on the company, and you should do your research about which provider would fit your website needs the most. In the course you will see how i sign up with one of the hosting companies and get a free domain for the first year.You might also be interested in getting a premium Wordpress theme, but that is not a necessity - the theme we will work with in this course is free and is good enough to keep it this way and to create a beautiful website and network.",

  "description": "<p><br></p><p>Please note that this course is only to be purchased by parents. Not Children. </p><p><strong><em>Reading for parents</em></strong></p><p>Do your kids spend too much time on the computer, phone or tablet? Don't you wish they could do something more productive? Why not get them to learn a life long valuable skill that will lead them into a career that pays 2 times the national average?</p><p>Programming is the new math. T<em>he average computer programmer makes&nbsp;</em><strong><em>78k a year&nbsp;</em></strong>and there will always be a need for programmers. The only problem is that all of the educational courses are not tailored towards the learning styles of children. Most of the documentation is geared towards people over 18.&nbsp;</p><p>This course shows kids how to code by adapting the material to their learning styles. There are animated lectures, informative screencasts and tests.&nbsp;</p><p>This course is not only fun for kids to watch and listen, it is interactive and fun. More and more people are learning to code so do you want your kids to not have the same opportunities as others? This course offers your kids a competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p><p>Employers look for technical skills and applicants that can code are more attractive to hire. Even if the job isn't technical it always helps to have that technical&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;to communicate with the technical team. Personally, I like to hire people with programming skills. If they are artists, video editors, or social media marketers, I generally prefer to hire people with programming experience.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About me, the instructor</strong></p><p>My name is John Bura and I have run the software company Mammoth Interactive. We have had a ton of sales on our software which includes XBOX 360, iPad and iPhone games. On top of this I have been teaching people full time since I was 17. With the combination of teaching experience and real world experience, I have a&nbsp;truly&nbsp;unique experience that you can't find anywhere else. The&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;I give out is from first hand&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;of the industry and years of teaching experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for considering to purchase my course. Even if you choose to not buy it I wish you and your family a happy road to success.&nbsp;</p>",

In this course we build a blog application Introducing you to Python Django Framework, Django Templating, the Bootstrap framework, HTMX, CSS, and HTML.</p><p>This course is primarily designed for anyone looking for a journey learning the Django Framework or developing web applications with Python. This course is a great starting point or a good first step after first learning about any of the technologies that this course features.</p><p>Currently, this course presents phase 1 of the development process. In phase 1 we initiate the project and get started building and testing the core functionality of the application. In Phase 1 we learn the fundamentals of the Python Django Framework, implement templates with Django, HTML, and CSS and create dynamic content using HTMX. By the end of phase 1, you will have a working, tested application ready for deployment. The intention for this course is to further extend the content and learning experience to eventually include deeper relevant content to further aid your understanding of the development process and techniques, deployment, and other associated technologies.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the course.

  "description": "<p>This course is designed for developers who want to build <strong>fullstack web applications using only Python</strong>, without the complexity of JavaScript, HTML, or CSS. By leveraging Django for backend development, PostgreSQL for database management, and Flet for frontend design, you will learn how to create modern, scalable applications efficiently.</p><p>The course begins with <strong>Django</strong>, where you will learn to build dynamic web applications, implement authentication systems, and develop RESTful APIs. You will gain hands-on experience with Django's ORM, middleware, and security features. The database section covers <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, teaching you how to design and optimize relational databases, write complex queries, and integrate them seamlessly with Django applications.</p><p>One of the most exciting aspects of this course is <strong>Flet</strong>, a powerful framework that allows you to build frontend applications directly in Python. Unlike traditional web development frameworks, Flet eliminates the need for JavaScript, HTML, or CSS while providing a fully interactive and visually appealing user interface. You will learn how to design responsive UIs, handle user interactions, and connect your frontend to a Django-powered backend.</p><p>Throughout the course, you will build <strong>real-world projects</strong> to reinforce your skills. You will learn best practices for <strong>API integration, user authentication, security, and deployment</strong> to cloud platforms. The course also covers software development methodologies, version control, and debugging techniques to prepare you for professional development environments.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will have the knowledge and confidence to build, deploy, and maintain <strong>fullstack web applications using Python</strong>. Whether you are a beginner looking to start a career in web development or an experienced developer seeking to expand your skill set, this course provides a <strong>comprehensive and practical approach to modern fullstack development</strong>.</p>",

'MERN' stands for the four technologies that make up the stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database used for JSON-like storage, including ad-hoc queries, indexing, replication, and load balancing. Express is a Node.js back-end web application framework utilized for building web applications and APIs. React is a front-end library used for making user interfaces. And lastly, Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, which allows programmers to run code outside of a web browser. MERN stack is not to be confused with MEAN web dev stack, which uses Angular.js instead of React.js as the JavaScript library.</p><p><strong>What skills should I have before learning MERN Stack?</strong></p><p>It is crucial to have a foundational understanding of web development before learning the MERN stack. So, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript skills are all required before you take on learning MERN Stack. In addition, it is good to have a working knowledge of Git and GitHub, the essentials of HTTP, and some understanding of JavaScript frameworks. Furthermore, it is also beneficial to be familiar with back-end language, database/web storage, and web application architecture. These skillsets will make for a smoother learning process as you navigate the intricacies of MERN Stack.</p><p><strong>Why should I use MERN Stack?</strong></p><p>MERN Stack remains completely open-source, uses only one programming language (JavaScript), and has superior UI rendering and performance compared to competing Stacks. The only difference between MERN Stack and MEAN Stack is that the former uses React.js (instead of Angular.js) for the JavaScript library/framework. Thus, the framework and library are where the differences for UI rendering and performance come into play. React.js library is newer than the Angular.js framework, but beware when comparing the two because both have pros and cons. Also, some programmers have noted Angular.js's steep learning curve when compared to React.js.</p><p><strong>What is full stack web development?</strong></p><p>Full stack web development refers to the process of developing both client- and server-side software. That means you can expect anyone with \"full stack\" included in their job title to have expertise in several front- and backend languages and frameworks. On the frontend, mastery in HTML and CSS is a common requirement for the field. Developers also tend to use JavaScript, jQuery, or Angular when developing a browser platform. Concerning the backend, full stack development consists of programming servers and databases. A server might call for code in PHP, ASP, Python, or Node, while a database can accept languages like SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB.</p><p><strong>What are some common frameworks for full stack web development?</strong></p><p>Because full stack web development includes both front- and backend frameworks, you should be familiar with some of the common frameworks for both. If you work in a Python-based environment, for example, Django will be of interest to you. For the frontend, both React and React JS are currently growing as the most widely used frameworks. However, companies that are using more legacy frontend frameworks may use Angular. Spring Boot is a Java-based backend framework. Rails, known as Ruby on Rails, is a backend web app framework based on Ruby. Development environments that use JavaScript on the backend are likely to use Node.js with Express.js or MetorJS. You can also use Symfony as your web development framework, which stems from PHP.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between full stack, backend, and frontend web development?</strong></p><p>Frontend web developers write client-side code. This is all the code that runs on the user's computer when they visit a website. Generally, this includes everything that the user can see. To write frontend code, you need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Backend web developers write server-side code. This is all the code that runs on the website's server. Backend code controls the logic of the website. For example, a frontend developer may code where a username will appear on a website and its style, but the backend developer will write the code that retrieves the username from the database. Backend developers need to know a server-side programming language in addition to HTML and JavaScript. Not all projects have a front and backend web developer. Some projects only have full-stack web developers, which do both front and backend coding. The team composition depends on the needs of the project. Full-stack web developers need to be strong front and backend coders.</p><p><strong>Are full stack web developers in demand?</strong></p><p>Full stack developers are in high demand across multiple industries, making it a great career path to follow. You'll find this to be especially true in the computer software, IT, internet, financial services, and higher education fields. Even better news is that you can expect full stack developers to be a popular job title for a while. This is due to the fact that many companies are in a constant state of evolving their software to meet the ever-changing needs of the users they service and the servers they host on. If you're interested in helping businesses advance their software, now is the perfect time to become a full stack developer.</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><strong>What is Node.Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications. It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time. By using JavaScript, node.Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript. Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux). Node.js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast. Examples of applications that use node.Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node.Js?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is open-source, meaning it’s free code for all developers. On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node.Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base. Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node.Js environment continues to be enhanced. Because Node.Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment. It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training. Node.Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node.Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs. It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run). Node.Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required. Because Node.Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs. The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time. It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies.</p><p><strong><em>Fresh Content</em></strong></p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate.

Since 2015, I’ve been teaching web development and helping hundreds of students — including tens of thousands on Udemy — build the skills they need to thrive in tech. My goal is to make React approachable, practical, and fun for beginners.</p><p>If you’ve never worked with React before, this course is the perfect place to start. A solid foundation in JavaScript is recommended, so if you’re brand new to coding, you may want to learn JavaScript basics first.

  "description": "<p>In this course you will create several microservices in <strong>Java 21</strong>, using the <strong>Spring Boot V3</strong> framework&nbsp;and <strong>Docker</strong> containers, building a backend application to interact with Amazon Web Services resources, as the mentioned below. These resources will be created in AWS using the <strong>AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) V2</strong>, a modern way to model and provision infrastructure in AWS. The AWS&nbsp;CDK is one of the best <strong>infrastructure as code</strong>, or <strong>IaC</strong>, tools for AWS;</p><p><strong>Spring Boot V3</strong> is a powerful <strong>Java</strong> framework to build server-side applications with annotations, controllers, services, request interceptors and much more.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will cover the following AWS&nbsp;resources and tools with practical exercises:</p><ul><li><p><strong>AWS ECS:</strong> the <strong>Elastic Container Service</strong> is the AWS container orchestration service. With this service it's possible to manage the Docker based microservices containers execution in a robust and scalable way. And with the <strong>AWS Fargate</strong>, the Serverless compute for containers from Amazon Web Services, it isn't necessary create EC2 instances, reducing the operating cost of container based applications;</p></li><li><p><strong>AWS&nbsp;ECR: </strong>with the Elastic Container Registry from AWS it's possible to create private repositories to store the microservices' container Docker images;</p></li><li><p><strong>AWS&nbsp;VPC: </strong>with the Virtual Private Cloud it's possible to secure the infrastructure with private subnets and network security policies for inbound and outbound traffic rules;</p></li><li><p><strong>AWS&nbsp;ALB: </strong>the Application Load Balancer from AWS allows the incoming HTTP traffic to be balanced between all the available application instances, and with the integrated target groups, each instance can be monitored to only receive traffic if it is healthy;</p></li><li><p><strong>API Gateway REST:</strong> with the AWS <strong>API Gateway</strong> it's possible to protect the application <strong>REST&nbsp;API</strong>, as well as performing query string parameter and requests' body validation;</p></li><li><p><strong>CloudWatch Logs:</strong> responsible for concentrating applications logs and its metrics. The applications that will be created in this course will generate logs into CloudWatch Logs in a JSON format, using the <strong>log4j2</strong> library. In this way, we can inject parameters in the logs, to be used in queries in the <strong>AWS&nbsp;CloudWatch Logs Insights</strong> console;</p></li><li><p><strong>CloudWatch Alarms:</strong> with the alarms from <strong>CloudWatch</strong> it will be possible to monitor the abnormal occurrences from the applications and AWS&nbsp;resources;</p></li><li><p><strong>CloudWatch Container Insights:</strong> with the <strong>Container Insights</strong> it's possible to aggregate monitoring information from the applications running in AWS&nbsp;ECS, including its logs;</p></li><li><p><strong>DynamoDB:</strong> the <strong>DynamoDB</strong> is a powerful NoSQL and non-relational database managed service. This course presents the usage of the <strong>DynamoDB enhanced client</strong> from the <strong>AWS&nbsp;SDK V2 for Java, </strong>which is a high-level library that allows a way to map client-side classes to DynamoDB tables;</p></li><li><p><strong>SQS:</strong> the SQS, or <strong>Simple Queue Service</strong>, is a queue service which allows asynchronous communication between applications, in order to exchange messages and events;</p></li><li><p><strong>SNS:</strong> with the SNS, or <strong>Simple Notification Service</strong>, it's possible to create topics and publish messages to be received by several resources and applications;</p></li><li><p><strong>S3:</strong> the S3, or <strong>Simple Storage Service</strong>, has a file storage with no server provisioning. Also, the S3 generates notifications when files are added to it;</p></li><li><p><strong>X-Ray:</strong> the <strong>AWS&nbsp;X-Ray</strong> is a service which allows analysis and debugging of distributed applications;</p></li><li><p><strong>IAM:</strong> the <strong>Identity and Access Management</strong> from AWS allows roles and permissions management, granted to users and services to access other AWS&nbsp;resources;</p></li><li><p><strong>AWS Cost Explorer:</strong> with the <strong>Cost Explorer</strong> from AWS it's possible to generate cost graphs about resource consumption, split by resource types and tags, which can identify applications and their parts.</p></li></ul><p>These resources will be created on AWS using the AWS Cloud Development Kit - CDK, a modern way of modeling and provisioning infrastructure on AWS using the <strong>Java</strong> language. The AWS CDK is ideal if you want to work in the <strong>DevOps</strong> and in the <strong>infrastructure as code</strong> fields.</p><p><br></p><p>With this you will also learn how to use the <strong>AWS SDK V2 for Java</strong>, which is a set of libraries developed by AWS itself to use its services.</p><p><br></p><p>The <strong>AWS SDK V2 for Java</strong> is fully integrated with the <strong>Spring Boot</strong> <strong>V3</strong> framework and with <strong>JDK 21</strong> libraries, so it's very easy to access the AWS&nbsp;resources in an elegant way, creating operations to be execute concurrently.</p><p><br></p><p>If you already have <strong>AWS certification</strong> and are looking for hands-on experience, you can get that with this course, through the exercises that will be offered here.</p><p><br></p><p>This course has a good balance between <strong>theoretical and practical exercises</strong>. You can expect <strong>detailed explanations with diagrams</strong> and well-guided implementations, always with a well-defined purpose.</p><p><br></p><p>Note: This course is not intended to prepare you for an AWS certification exam. There are other courses that are specific to AWS certifications.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Also included in the package, when you buy this course:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Student support</strong>, through the platform questions and answers section;</p></li><li><p><strong>Project source code</strong> to help you at the beginning of the course;</p></li><li><p><strong>Quizzes</strong> to test your knowledge about course topics;</p></li><li><p><strong>Practical exercises</strong> to let you practice, with detailed solutions offered by the instructor;</p></li></ul><p><strong>About the instructor:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>I've been worked daily with the presented technologies</strong> in this course since 2016, acting as an AWS hosted solutions developer;</p></li><li><p>I've been a <strong>profesor in cloud computing and mobile</strong> subjects, including AWS, in a postgraduate course for almost 10 years;</p></li><li><p>I have <strong>published books</strong> on the subject;</p></li><li><p>I am part of the AWS Community Builder since 2020, a global community created by <strong>Amazon Web Services.</strong></p></li></ul><p>Credits for the music used in the course presentation: Bensound - License code: 8XYDILY4RHGNN6VB</p>",

No more coding for hours building a time / date feature for your application with Carbon this is a thing of the past.</p>\n\n<p>With this course you will create time / date features for your application in minutes if not seconds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why I created this course? </strong></p>\n\n<p>I created this course because I saw myself spending too much time with dates and time when building my applications, so I needed a better solution. A solution that would take little time and a solution that was easy to implement. I figured if I was spending too much time on this,  others probably had the same issue, right? </p>\n\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>I love all my students and my success depends on theirs, or I should say on yours. Come join me in this course and learn to create date and time the easy way. </p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course, you will learn the important underlying mechanics of all the different types of Blazor web applications. You will not have to write a single line of code to get through this course.</p><p>I am specifically steering away from jumping into the code, because without understanding the subtle differences between the different Blazor applications, you will end up 'coding in the dark', and you will get into issues for which there is not much support for currently. For example, if you don't understand the detailed mechanics of Blazor applications, you will not understand why you are getting CORS errors when making HTTP&nbsp;calls from your Blazor WASM application, or why you are getting database concurrency issues with Blazor Server and EF Core. And so on...</p><p>The course is divided into 5 parts. The first two parts of this course will focus on the theory of Blazor. In Parts 3 to 5, we will see those theoretical concepts from Parts 1 and 2 in action.</p><p>In Part 1, I will discuss what Blazor is, what the different types of Blazor applications are, and how the different hosting options work. I will also go into some detail about Single Page Applications and WebAssembly technology.</p><p>In Part 2, I will cover the .Net7 Framework, the Document Object Model, and the Render Tree concepts.</p><p>In Part 3, we will start getting more hands-on. We will create and run both Blazor Server and Blazor WASM applications from within Visual Studio. We will also start comparing the two application types in Part 3.</p><p>In Part 4, we will go into more detail with both Server and WASM applications. There will be a big focus on the runtime differences, which we'll explore using our browser developer tools. </p><p>Then finally, in Part 5, we'll create, run and install Blazor Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) onto our local machines. We will create 2 types of PWAs - a stand-alone PWA and an ASP(.)NetCore Hosted Application. We'll conclude Part 5 with some closing remarks about why PWAs are not always the best option for your use case, and what complications come with the development and testing of PWAs.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Faster and Better are two words that are constantly heard in the development world. Apps need to be built quicker, perform better and be scalable. This has resulted in technologies such as React and Redux to be created.</p>\n\n<p>So, what are React and Redux? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>React JS is an open-source JavaScript library that works as the V in the Model-View-Controller, allowing the system to render components that has additional components written as custom HTML tags. It allows incorporating HTML tags to make the developer’s coding more flexible. Using a JavaScript syntax extension, known as JSX, the coding is more readable and easier to write. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Redux is slightly different. Although, inspired from Facebook’s Flux technology, it is not at all the same. Instead, Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It allows the developer to write apps regardless of the environment, resulting in more consistently running apps. It works by storing the whole app in an object tree inside a single store. In order for a change to be made, an action is emitted, which does not result in the state of the app to be changed but rather a new object to be returned. The developer writes a reducer, a special function, which determines how an action will modify the state of the entire application. This made the app easier to run and even test.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to learn how you can create apps that are fast and furious? Well, then here’s your chance. This amazing complete course is the perfect place for you to not only become acquainted with these brilliant technologies, but also master them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Breakdown React and Redux and learn them from scratch. This course includes everything you need to know about React and Redux. The course answers questions such as what is React and its basic features such as components, state, properties and lifecycle; what is Redux and its basic features such as state, store and reducers; and even how to combine them together to create a brilliant app.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to theory, this React and Redux tutorial also includes building a complete hands-on WeatherCheck Application to get you acquainted with using both technologies in real world applications.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>With so much packed in this course, let’s get started and learn how to build faster and better apps with React and Redux.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Learn to build full-stack isomorphic JavaScript web applications with Vue and Node.js along with the MEVN stack. The MEVN stack is a collection of great tools—MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, and Node.js—that provide a strong base for a developer to build easily maintainable web applications. With each of them a JavaScript or JavaScript-based technology, having a shared programming language means it takes less time to develop applications.</p><p>This course enables you to build, test, and deploy full stack isomorphic applications with Node.js, Express, Vue.js, and MongoDB. You will start by setting up the development environment and grasping some of the essential concepts for building applications. You will then build a single page application using MEVN stack. You will also develop a songs playlist application wherein you will create a new playlist and search through YouTube videos. Next, you will learn to consume data from third-party APIs within your application as well as perform CRUD operations against a locally hosted API using the HTTP client Axios. Finally, you will learn to deploy the applications on the cloud.</p><p><strong>By the end of this course, you will be able to build your own web and isomorphic applications using MEVN stack.</strong><br><strong>Meet Your Expert(s):</strong></p><p>We have the best work of the following esteemed author(s) to ensure that your learning journey is smooth:</p><ul><li><p><strong>David Acosta</strong> is a professional Software Developer with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology Management and more than three years' experience in web development.

It contains an introduction, tutorial, several \"how to\" guides, and then reference documentation for the components that make up the framework.</p><p><strong>Compatibility with standard hosting</strong></p><p>CodeIgniter 3 only needs PHP 5.2.4, and plays nicely with almost all shared or dedicated hosting platforms. Many webapps need a database, and CodeIgniter supports the most common, including MySQL.</p><p><strong>No restrictive coding rules</strong></p><p>Use your own coding and naming conventions, with only a few caveats that deal with classname conflicts. CodeIgniter looks to empower you, not shackle you.</p><p><strong>Simple solutions over complexity</strong></p><p>CodeIgniter encourages MVC but does not force it on you.</p><p><strong>Exceptional performance</strong></p><p>CodeIgniter consistently outperforms most of its competitors.</p><p><strong>No large-scale monolithic libraries</strong></p><p>CodeIgniter is not trying to be all things to all people. It is a lean MVC framework, with enough capabilities to improve your productivity, while providing for third-party addons/plugins for additional functionality.</p><p><strong>Nearly zero configuration</strong></p><p>Much of the CodeIgniter configuration is done by convention, for instance putting models in a \"models\" folder. There are still several configuration options available, through scripts in the \"config\" folder.</p><p><strong>No need for a template language</strong></p><p>CodeIgniter comes with a simple, substitution based, templating tool. Addons/plugins are available for most of the full-blown templating engines if that is what you are used to.</p><p><strong>Spend more time away from the computer</strong></p><p>Don't we all want it? CodeIgniter is easy to learn and to get proficient with.</p><p>#Codeigniter #Codeigniter3 #Rapid application development</p><p>#BCIT #Basics #Background #MVC #PHP #studyEasy #Easy Course</p><p><br></p><p>#Framework #Bootstarp #Performance #Websites</p><p><br></p>",

First of all I want to say a Happy new year to you and thank you stopping by to find out what this course or training is all about (i really appreciate it). Now, it's obvious you've seen this course title and subtitle, right? if the answer is yes, then I'm sure that you're actually looking for ways to automate your wordpress website (it's very important, especially in this era or age of modern technology), if this is the case, then you're actually in the right place. Now, if you run a online business or company, then you would understand the importance of a website, and automating it will give you more time to focus on your marketing strategy, so as to increase or optimize your business revenue,etc. For this reason, I've decided to create a unique course in which I'm gonna educate you on how to automate your wordpress website using certain unique plugins that are used in the website automation industry (this are top plugins in the website automation industry).</p><p>Now, i'm gonna start off this course by talking about different automation scenarios that will help you to actually figure out what you actually want to automate in your wordpress website (just in case you have no idea of what you really want to automate in your wordpress website), then after which i'm talk about the following:&nbsp; </p><p><strong>How to automate the maintenance process of your wordpress website.</strong></p><p><strong>How to link your social media platform to your wordpress website and automate the process.</strong></p><p><strong>How to automate&nbsp; a wordpress ecommerce website.</strong></p><p><strong>How to automate a wordpress membership site.</strong></p><p><strong>How to automate your wordpress website contents (content marketing).&nbsp; The best complete automation plugins (both the free and paid ones).</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>Now, this premium course or training is made for businesses or individuals who wish to automate their wordpress website and I strongly recommend you watch this course preview or promo video, so as to get a clear idea of the rare information and goodies packed inside this course. In case you don't know, the information that will be disclosed to you in this course is something that other website automation experts would easily charge you for a minimum of $500, but i decided not to (the $500 minimum price), because I understand that fact that you guys are actually a newbie, when it comes to wordpress website automation. if i were in your shoes and I came across a rare and premium course or training just like this particular one, then, i will consider it as a golden opportunity and won't let it slip off my fingers for any reason at all, considering the kind of information that i'm gonna get or acquire from this course (personally speaking).</p><p>Now, if you've decided that you want to automate you website by enrolling for this video course, then there are gonna be a few things that you'll need in order to get the most information out of this premium course and they including the following:</p><p><strong>An already created wordpress website. </strong></p><p><strong>Willingness to purchase certain paid wordpress automation plugins (they are also&nbsp; free plugins that will be disclosed to you in this course but we highly recommend you purchase the paid plugins because they often tend to provide more automaton functionality).</strong></p><p><strong>An idea of the type of wordpress website you're&nbsp; running and what you wish to automate (i'm gonna run some quick automation scenarios to help decide or figure out what you really want to automate in your wordpress website).</strong></p><p>Now, it's left for you to decide if you really want to tap into the world of wordpress website automation or if you really want to do everything manually forever. I hope you take a wise decision that will be the best for you.</p><p>Wish you the best,</p><p>James Gabriel.</p>",

  "description": "<p>The first <strong>COMPLETE ReactiveX Course</strong> is finally here! Learn everything you need to know about Reactive programming and ReactiveX in this one concise and comprehensive course. There are no proper resources to learn Reactive programming, UNTIL NOW.</p>\n\n<p>Reactive programming has become the latest go to technology for many companies, that helps developers design websites and apps that are more robust, resilient, flexible and scalable. All of this with the least amount of coding possible, you no longer have to worry about creating and maintaining way too many nested tables. The best part about Reactive programming is that it works with all the major programming languages that are currently available on the market, through ReactiveX.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>ReactiveX is a functional library extension that can be added to your programming to make your app or website reactive. It creates asynchronous and event­ based programs by using observable sequences. It allows developers to make arrays, objects, and also events into an observable stream,which can then be subscribed to and can emit data, errors (if something goes wrong) or even the complete signal if the event completes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>With the few number of resources available online, learning this technology has become a pain. You have to search for many different blogs that do not provide the complete information or very vague articles and manifestos that cover reactive programming, but not ReactiveX. This is why we created the complete Reactive and ReactiveX course, to help you learn everything you need to know about Reactive Programming and ReactiveX API in one place!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>From the fundamentals of Reactive Programming and how it can help you customize your app for responsiveness to setting up the environment to even creating a complete project with ReactiveX,this tutorial has it all.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will learn the Reactive programming paradigms, ReactiveX API and how you can incorporate it with JavaScript. You will also learn how to design observables from all sources possible, including creating them from scratch. We will also cover transforming and filtering functions and even how to combine two observations. Finally, you will design a WeatherFinder Project using everything you’ve learned in the course along with the instructor.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>With so much left to learn, what are you waiting for? Let’s get ReACTIVE!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you a PHP developer working on Yii framework? Do you want explore the new features of Yii 2 for creating fast-paced, secured web 2.0 based applications? If yes, this Learning Path is for you.</p>\n\n<p>Yii is a high-performance, component-based PHP framework for rapidly developing modern web applications. The name Yii can be considered as the acronym for Yes It Is!. Yii 2 inherits the main spirit behind Yii for being a simple, fast, highly-extensible PHP framework. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Packt’s Video Learning Paths are a series of individual video products put together in a logical and stepwise manner such that video builds on the skills learned in the video before it.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This Learning Path begins with installing Yii 2 framework, learning about application templates, dependency injection container, and model events. Then, you’ll learn to use your external code along with updating your existing Yii 1 applications to Yii 2.

  "description": "<p>In the last few decades, the web revolution has been taking over every aspect of our life. From ordering groceries to everyday banking to getting our daily news – there is hardly anything which is untouched by the latest web technologies.</p>\n\n<p>In this day and age – every business large or small needs to have a web presence and tell the world about themselves. Even individuals want to express themselves by using an online medium like blogs or personal websites. <br>Ability to build and run these sites has become an essential skill. Of course, we can hire a designer and web developer and pay them top dollar to build our site? Even if can afford them – what happens if we need to make inevitable changes to it or refresh the look? Does this necessarily need to become a lifelong expense?<br>NO! modern content management systems make it very easy for anyone with little to no knowledge about technology to build, run and maintain a very attractive and functional website. One such CMS is <strong>Joomla </strong>– it is open source and completely free. And what is more – it is very mature and widely used to build thousands of web properties on the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As such learning <strong>Joomla CMS</strong> will also give you added skills which are very valuable in the job market. The median income of a web developer in the US is around $73000 per year.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Those are only a few of the reasons why you must enroll in this course and take your career to the next level.<br> <br>By the end of this course you will:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Get familiar with the process of building a website based on <strong>Joomla</strong></li><li>Understand  core terms and definitions on the components and functionality provided by <strong>Joomla CMS</strong></li><li>Be familiar with the Joomla administration control panel which helps you control every aspect f your site</li><li>Learn how to use the features and configure core settings of <strong>Joomla</strong></li><li>Improve performance and take security precautions while building a <strong>Joomla </strong>website</li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>In this course, we will create a project like an online-course-application.</p><p>When I say online-course-application, we can think of it like that we will have a product-list page such as book-list, food-list or course-list. Somehow users or customers will see these product-lists and they can buy one of the products. Of course, at the end of it, this transaction will be logged.</p><p>Actually, in our application, we will try to implement these processes with different microservices.</p><p><br></p><p>To implement this application, we will use five different microservices.</p><p>Our microservices will be api-gateway, course-service, purchase-service, eureka-discovery-service and frontend-with-angular.</p><p><br></p><p>In api-gateway, we will manage APIs. This microservice will be a gateway for the whole application. To access the other services, we will use this microservice. In this microservice, we will handle user-management also. We will authorize users and if the users are authorized, other services can be available.</p><p><br></p><p>In course-service, we will manage course CRUD operations. This service will be a course-management-service.</p><p><br></p><p>In purchase-service, we will manage purchase CRUD operations. This service will store the logs coming from the course purchases. For example, the UserX bought the CourseX on DateX etc.</p><p><br></p><p>Our other microservice will be eureka discovery service. To provide it we will use spring-cloud-netflix-eureka library.</p><p>This microservice allows services to find and communicate with each other without hard coding hostname and port.</p><p>With eureka service, other services can register eureka servers and all of them can reach each-other with application name.</p><p><br></p><p>These four microservices will be used for server side.</p><p>On the client side, we will use Angular to consume all data which come from these microservices. And we will provide a user-friendly UI with angular.</p><p><br></p><p>Our microservices dependency process will be like that.</p><p>Clients can access the system from the UI. On angular-UI,users can take different actions like creating courses, purchasing courses etc. All requests coming from angular-UI will go to api-gateway. So all traffic will pass over api-gateway.</p><p>To access the api-gateway, the client should pass the login process. Then other services will be accessible over the api-gateway.</p><p><br></p><p>Spring-security will be one of the main topics in our application. Also, we will use JWT to provide security.</p><p>Here, the important point is, we will also use secure connections among microservices. To provide it, we will use secure-key-tokens.</p><p><br></p><p>As a database, we will use MySQL, PostgreSQL and H2Database. We will use different databases to show the functionalities of microservices.</p><p><br></p><p>We will provide connections between microservices with the OpenFeign library. OpenFeign will handle connection problems in the gateway.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, on the backend to provide the connection among all microservices, we will use eureka discovery server. Eureka-discovery-server will be aware of all microservices and it helps to create connections between microservices easily.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to these libraries, In our project, we will use lots of technologies like Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Maven, Lombok, JWT etc.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course here, our main library will be Spring-boot. It will provide a simpler and faster way to set up, configure, and run rest API applications.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of each microservices, we will test our applications with Postman. Postman is another amazing tool to debug networking.</p>",

  "description": "<p>The name stands for Active Server Pages Network Enabled Technologies. <strong>This is a Beginner to Advanced level course on .NET</strong>&nbsp; that will take you from basics all the way to advance mode. This course is for anyone who is new to ASP.NET or who is familiar with ASP.NET and wants to take the first stab at understanding what is different in ASP.NET. Easiest formula to understand all concepts in .NET</p><p>There are a number of flavors of ASP.NET, Web Forms (Web Sites and Web Applications), Model-View-Controller (MVC) , Razor Pages and the newest one Blazor. This course is aimed at anyone who wants to create dynamic websites using all these models , with ASP.NET Web Forms as the starting point.</p><p>ASP.NET is the Microsoft platform for developing Web Applications. Using ASP.NET you can create e-commerce sites, data driven portals and just about anything else you can find on the internet. Best of all, you don't need to paste together a jumble of HTML and JavaScript code. Instead you can create full scale web apps by leveraging your knowledge of C# coding and a design tool like Visual Studio.</p><p>In recent years Microsoft has added MVC (Model View Controller) and Razor pages which offer different ways to build dynamic web pages. To some , MVC and Razor pages are cleaner and more suited to the web. To others , it's a whole lot of extra effort with no clear payoff. Either way, it's good to have a strong knowledge of all of these web application programming models before moving onto the most future forward choice .... <strong>Blazor</strong>.</p><p>We cover all these models at a beginners level and offer a multitude of practical applications.</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Hey guys!\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>In this course, I am going to teach you how to speed up your WordPress website without doing any coding or paying any extra dollar!\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Rihab, an Engineer with more than 5 years experience in web designing and seo. I have helped hundreds of people to enhance their website speed and now I intend to help you enhance your website speed.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know how frustrating it is to have a slow website; I have been there myself and I know what you might be feeling right now. Especially, when every article in the internet is telling you that you have to fix your website speed.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, you should know that Website speed affects your user's experience. Clients usually avoid slow websites, and not only do they run away from such websites, they also never come back to visit them again!\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine yourself going to eat at a restaurant. You sit on your table waiting for the waiter to come and give you the menu. And you keep on waiting for a long time without him showing up. What will you do then? I bet you will leave the restaurant and go to the closest one!\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is exactly what happens when someone visits a slow website.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, Website speed affects your Google ranks, and this is something no one should tolerate! Google aims to give their clients the best experience they can get, that is why it favors fast websites and ranks them highly. So if you are aiming for a higher Google rank you have to take good care of your website speed.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you might have tried so many online solutions, read dozens of articles, downloaded many plug-ins hoping to speed up your website… and nothing really worked out, nothing fixed your website speed.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But do not panic. In this course you will find the solution for all your problems, and not only will you be able to fix your website speed instantly but you will also provide your website with the suitable plans to keep it running fast with a minimum of efforts and without having to do any coding!\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will start this course by explaining what is website speed.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we'll see together the method of measuring the website speed and how to analyze the results we get.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you will learn how to clean up your wordpress website so that you save space for your valuable data.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Then I will teach you, step by step, how to optimize your existing media as well as your new media before uploading them to your website… And believe me, you will be surprised to see how easy this is and how much your media optimization will affect your website speed.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Afterwards, I will reveal to you the special tricks I use to change slow and boring websites into fast and vivid ones. These tricks will be the key points in the transformation of your website speed. When I first discovered them, I thought that I had put my hands on some kind of magic tricks because the huge amount of improvement you will see and experience in your website speed shall astonish you.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this course, I will deliver these tricks to you in a simple easy way. I will show you the tricks and I will accompany you into applying them step by step.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here I will teach you how to optimize every part of your website and how to keep it optimized all the time with a minimum of efforts! To maintain a high website speed!\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course is simple, quick and straight to the point. It is structured to respond to all your needs and to suit everyone. Both Wordpress beginners and experts will benefit from it.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can start by applying these techniques tonight; I guarantee you that within 2 days you will experience a better website speed, and, thus, you will enhance your Google rank as well.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course doesn't have a fixed price; it gets more expensive every day, i.e. if you visit this page tomorrow you might find that the price of the course has changed. Therefore, you'd better take profit of the opportunity and subscribe today at a lower price.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not wait or hesitate because each passing minute of your website-life counts. Now, at this very moment, you are losing visitors, clients, and money _and you are losing them for good_, because of your website speed. Act and fix your website speed, let it rank highly in Google, let your visitors enjoy your website, and make them your permanent clients so that you can start collecting your profits!\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And do not forget you can also check the free parts of my course.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you in few minutes.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n</p>",

Here,&nbsp;toufiqElahySPA.js is a Jquery Plugin which is responsible&nbsp;to turn any web application into single page application. I developed this Plugin to <strong>minimize </strong>developer's effort while working on Creating Single Page Application. Let's see, how my Plugin can make developers life better.</p><p><strong>Single page applications are more capable of decreasing load \ntime of pages and the amount of data transfer from server to client.</strong> </p><p><strong>Why This Course?</strong></p><ol><li><p>&nbsp;There are several pain points while working with Javascript framework like AngularJs, React, VueJs, Knockout, meteor e.t.c. in a ASP.NET MVC application in order to create Single-Page Application. Few Pain Points Are:\n</p><ol><li><p><strong>Need to specify routing for each request</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Need to modify Server side technology according to Javascript framework</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Only possible to debug on run time&nbsp;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Hard-coded data-binding caused too many error</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Increase&nbsp;the complexity a lot</strong></p></li></ol></li><li><p>&nbsp; developer&nbsp;no need to learn any javascript framework&nbsp;and also&nbsp;no need to write much Jquery&nbsp;code&nbsp;to make Single Page Application after using my Jquery Plugin(toufiqElahySPA.js).</p></li><li><p><strong>&nbsp;Note:</strong> developer can also use other JavaScript framework(angularjs, knockout, react e.t.c.) side by side with my Jquery Plugin. But no need, i will <strong>prove</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>I applied the Plugin in a .NET Web application. This plugin will also work for <strong>Other </strong>Web Technologies too. I&nbsp;will show in my future course.</p></li><li><p>90% of time Developer no need to Create <strong>View-model Classes</strong>.</p></li></ol><p><strong>This course is so important to Developer who loves:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Strongly Typed </strong>data-binding(Razor code)</p></li><li><p><strong>Compile time </strong>error checking,&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>auto code completion(<strong>IntelliSense</strong>),&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Re-usability&nbsp;</strong>,</p></li><li><p>not to get<strong> Run-time </strong>error unexpectedly&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>to get rid from&nbsp;<strong>complexity&nbsp;</strong>should definitely take this course.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Why (toufiqElahySPA.js)Jquery plugin is better&nbsp;than&nbsp;any JavaScript&nbsp;framework:</strong></p><p><strong>(1)</strong> Developer won't need to write too much Javascript code after using my plugin wheres developer usually writes too many javascript code while working with <strong>AngularJs</strong>(javascript framework)</p><p><strong>(2)</strong> Developer won't need to write Jquery <strong>ajax </strong>code because the plugin has ajax function specified which will be called automatically as a common function</p><p><strong>(3)</strong> Developer won't need to specify <strong>routing </strong>as like AngularJs because My plugin will follow ASP.NET MVC routing by <strong>default</strong>.</p><p><strong>(4)</strong> Developer can learn using my plugin easily and quickly. just&nbsp;need to follow&nbsp;only 5 rules of my plugin&nbsp;and any <strong>complex scenario</strong> can be achieved through this plugin like AngularJs [i will prove]&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(5)&nbsp;</strong>Developer<strong>&nbsp;</strong>can also make Single-Page app even <strong>not following</strong> those 5 rules of the plugin. Those rules are for critical situation.
