  "description": "<p><strong>Learn C# Coding with Unity (for VR projects)</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We’re on the verge of a new industry. The metaverse is all around us!&nbsp;However, VR and AR developers cannot rely on drag and drop tools yet – and need to hardcode their applications to join the metaverse. As this is mostly uncovered territory, if you want to become a metaverse creator, you will need to showcase your curiosity, your willingness to deep-dive into coding problems, and your determination to stand up again after 100 failures.</p><p>Are you sure you want to become a Virtual reality prototyper? Sometimes it feels like a big risk to make a career change into programming. Learn C# programming, and find out if you enjoy coding.</p><p><br></p><p>This course has been designed to make you find out if you want to continue this path.</p><ul><li><p>Do you enjoy learning to code? Trying, failing, trying, failing (100x times), &amp; succeeding?</p></li><li><p>Do you enjoy engaging proactively with a community of like-minded people?</p></li><li><p>Do you enjoy challenging yourself with new concepts, tools, and methodologies?</p></li></ul><p>Not everyone will shout yes to the above questions. Everyone has different strengths. This path may not be for everyone. Learning how to develop virtual reality games and applications means that you need to be open to learning in an environment that is heavily coding-based. Low-code tools are not preparing for your next XR project or job role and VR/AR designers become more valuable whenever they learn how to prototype.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why is this course special?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>You will get access to our Proprietary XR Knowledgebase!</strong></p><p>Based on all our students' questions and previous lectures, we are continuously adding content to our XR knowledge base. With our proprietary tagging system, you will easily find answers to the most common questions around course content and XR project implementation. You will also get continuous access to all the recordings of the classes, in case you need to refresh your knowledge on topics treated in class</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You will get an Invite to join the XR&nbsp;Creators Discord community!</strong></p><p>The XR&nbsp;Creators Community is a community of over 3000 developers helping each other with their industry, tech, or VR/AR&nbsp;development questions. Join the server, there's a dedicated channel just for questions and answers related to this course. This way, we make sure that you're successful and can successfully finish this course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Assignments and prepared asset downloads to get you started!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Just watching videos won't get you anywhere. We prepared easy, medium, and difficult assignments to challenge you and get you to apply your learnings to fun and real-life projects. If you need feedback, feel free to share your assignment submissions in the XR&nbsp;Creators discord community :)</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong> is one of the most powerful and in-demand tools in the game development industry today. However, it can be intimidating for beginners to get started. That’s why this course was created — to help you confidently learn Unreal Engine by building a fully functional, realistic racing game from scratch.</p><p>This is a hands-on, project-based course where we will walk through every major step of game development. By the end, you’ll have your own racing game complete with core gameplay systems and a polished feel.</p><p>What You’ll Learn:</p><ul><li><p>Rigging a car model in <strong>Blender 3D</strong></p></li><li><p>Making the car drivable in <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong></p></li><li><p>Texturing and applying materials</p></li><li><p>Integrating <strong>AI opponent cars</strong> to make the race competitive</p></li><li><p>Setting up a game environment using a <strong>realistic pre-built city</strong>, complete with roads, buildings, trees, and lighting</p></li><li><p>Solving problems and making creative design decisions as we go — just like a real developer</p></li></ul><p>The course is beginner-friendly, though having some prior experience with Unreal Engine or Blender will be helpful. Throughout the course, you'll be exposed to real development challenges and solutions, giving you insight into how a game comes together from the ground up.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Final Project</strong></p><p>As a final challenge, you’ll build your own version of the game — set in your own city or using a theme of your choice.</p><p>You can use the same 3D models used in the course or bring in your own assets. To reinforce your learning, be sure to apply all the techniques covered in class. You are encouraged to experiment and make the game your own.</p><p><strong>Bonus challenge:</strong><br>If you choose to model the car and buildings yourself in Blender, it will further sharpen your modeling and customization skills.</p><p>Add your own touches with custom lighting setups, materials, and colors to make your project stand out.</p><p>This is more than just a tutorial — it’s a complete learning journey where you and I build the game together from start to finish.</p><p><strong>Enroll now</strong> and take your Unreal Engine skills to the next level.</p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course, you will become proficient in C# and some of Unity's core features, by creating a First person Shooter that includes a 3D environment, intelligent Non-Player Characters, and special effects.</p><ul><li><p>In the first section of the course entitled \"<em>Adding Simple AI</em>, \", you will use C# for the creation of a simple launcher. You will learn to instantiate, use and control Rigidbody objects from your script as well as creating explosions. </p><p><br></p></li><li><p>In the second section entitled \"<em>Creating and Managing Weapons </em>\", you will learn to create and manage weapons using a simple inventory system. You will create an automatic gun and a grenade launcher, manage the collection of ammunition, and also implement a user interface to keep track of ammunition. In addition, you will also learn how to include these as prefabs, so that they can be reused in other levels, and to save you some coding too.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>In the third section entitled <em>\"Using Finite State Machines\"</em>,  you will get an in-depth explanation of how to create and use Finite State Machines (FSM) in Unity. You will create your FSM and use it to control the behavior and movement of an animated Non-Player Character. You will also learn how to employ NavMesh navigation so that your animated NPCs can navigate easily within the scene to either follow the player or go to a specific location. Finally, you will learn how to optimize your assets so that they can be reused seamlessly in other scenes with no or little changes. </p><p><br></p></li><li><p>The  last section called \"Putting it All Together\", makes it possible to combine the skills you have acquired in the previous chapters, and to reuse and combine all the objects that you have created so far (e.g., NPCs, weapons, inventory systems, ammunition, etc.), and the concepts (e.g., FSM, NavMesh, RigidBody components, User Interface, etc.) that you have mastered, to create a fully functional level.</p></li></ul><p>After completing this course, you will become proficient in the following areas:</p><ul><li><p>C# programming</p></li><li><p>Rigidbody Physics.</p></li><li><p>Objects' Instantiation.</p></li><li><p>Animating 3D characters.</p></li><li><p>Artificial Intelligence for Non-Player Characters</p></li><li><p>Mecanim and Finite-State Machines.</p></li><li><p>Prefabs Creation.</p></li><li><p>Inventory System.</p></li><li><p>RayCasting.</p></li><li><p>Collision Detection.</p></li><li><p>User Interface Creation.</p></li><li><p>Persistent Objects.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Important Note:</strong><br>All source code provided in this course remains valid and compatible with the latest versions of Android Studio and Android SDKs.<br>Please note, however, that the course was originally created using an earlier version of Android Studio and the Android SDK.</p><p>If your goal is to:</p><ul><li><p>Learn <strong>game development logic</strong> from the ground up,</p></li><li><p>Build a <strong>game loop</strong> from scratch,</p></li><li><p>Create your own <strong>custom game framework</strong> to develop future games more quickly and efficiently,</p></li><li><p>And you wish to <strong>code entirely in Java</strong> without relying on external game engines,</p></li></ul><p>— then this course is ideal for you. Otherwise, we recommend exploring other courses that better match your needs.<br>Are you curious about building simple Android games but don't want to dive into any game development frameworks (like Unity)? Do you want to understand how to do animation on android? How to detect collision? How to play sound effects? How to implement a health and scoring system? And, most importantly, how to make a game loop and your own simple gaming framework that you can use for building future games? After making the game, you must be looking for ways to monetize your game and publish it on Google Play, right?</p><p>If you say Yes to any one of these questions, you're at the right place.</p><p>Hi, my name is Sandip and I've published 10+ android games on Google Play. I also created some of the highly-rated Android Game Development courses on Udemy. So, I happen to know about android game development and in this course, I’ll show you exactly how to create and monetize 5 complete games step-by-step from beginning to end including <strong>1) Retro Snake, 2) Save the Bunny, 3) Space Shooter,</strong> <strong>4) Brick Breaker </strong>and <strong>5) Save Earth</strong>. I only expect you to know a little bit of Java programming and made one or two apps in Android Studio. That’s all. No big deal. Other than that, I expect that you have the latest version of Android Studio up and running on your Pc, Chipmunk, or higher. I’ll go through the building process line by line to explain and help you understand how to build these fun games. We’ll start from scratch creating an empty project and building the complete game step by step. In the end, you will have 5 fully working, playable games that you can enjoy and the confidence to make any simple game on Android Studio. I'll also guide you to implement the Google Admob banner and interstitial ads so that you can start getting some revenue.</p><p>You will also have the security of a <strong>money-back guarantee</strong>. In fact, if for any reason within 30 days, you won't completely satisfied with your purchase, you can easily request a refund that will be given to you without any kind of question from Udemy!</p><p>Let's get started. It will be fun!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Learning Unreal Engine can be difficult. Especially when you don’t know what to even look for in order to learn. So I put together a course that will guide you from a beginners level, all the way to advanced topics. Not only to teach you, but to give you direction on what you may be interested in studying further.</p><p>I'll show you custom materials for trees. And how to create effects like waterfalls. I'll introduce you to cameras, and particle systems. And will focus on teaching you step by step how to create new types of materials and how to incorporate them into your landscapes. From the basic painting of landscapes, to auto materials, to advanced material layers. I show you everything you'll need to make stunning art. This is an environment art course, but we will not be focusing on modeling hard surface objects like buildings. I will go over creating foliage like trees, as well as show you how to create rocks. I will be bringing in some photoscanned assets for composing our scenes, via quixel. Quixel is a photoscan library free to use in Unreal engine. I’ll use my own assets later on, and show you how to mix Quixel’s textures with your own models to make great looking materials. So lets get to it!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the <strong>'VR Beat Boxer'</strong>,<strong> </strong>game development course, where you will learn to create a clone, of the extremely popular rhythm fitness games like<strong> </strong>Beat Saber,<strong> </strong>and Super Natural. </p><p><strong>Build once and deploy to both Oculus and Steam VR devices, with ease.</strong></p><p>This course, teaches you everything you need to know, to build your very own VR Beat Boxer rhythm fitness game, using the world class Unity Engine, latest LTS version 2020.4.x.</p><p>I am an <strong>Emeritus </strong>certified <strong>iDTech</strong> instructor and also the author of the book '<strong>Unity® Virtual Reality Development with VRTK4: A No-Coding Approach to Developing Immersive VR Experiences, Games, &amp; Apps' </strong>published by Apress and available world wide on the Amazon and Springer stores. </p><p>Unity is the top rated game engine, when it comes to developing VR apps and games. <strong>VRTK </strong>on the other hand is a<strong> battle-tested VR solution</strong> for Unity. Several block buster games have been made using Unity and VRTK.</p><p>VRTK 4 in conjunction with Unity, has changed the dynamics of VR development. No other game engine comes even close, to providing you with such advanced functionality for VR development, as does <strong>VRTK 4 with Unity</strong>.</p><p>This course makes understanding VRTK&nbsp;4, super easy, and the Beat Boxer game you develop, will be a complete game, you could even publish to both Oculus and Steam. </p><p>The VRTK 4 framework takes care of&nbsp; all the heavy lifting, in terms of VR Mechanics required. You only add a little extra code, to pull it all together, the way you want it to work. </p><p>Once you have taken this course, you will be poised, to create <strong>amazing rhythm fitness games</strong>, like Super Natural an Beat Saber.</p><p>This course is <strong>aimed at beginner to intermediate Unity users</strong>, who need to know their way about the Unity editor, for basic scene editing. A basic knowledge of C# programming for Unity is also required, where you need to know what a Class is, what a method is, have knowledge about C#'s basic variable types, if statements and loops. </p><p>This course will take you through everything, <strong>step by step</strong> and give you plenty of <strong>practice</strong> along the way.</p><p>You will need to have access to a 6 DOF (degrees of freedom) headset, for Steam VR or Oculus only. </p><p>You could use a Steam VR headset like the HTC Vive, or an Oculus Rift, or an Oculus Quest (both 1 and 2 will work fine), which are some of the more popular, 6 DOF headsets available, and the ones this course has been tested against.</p><p>If using the Oculus Quest, it would be advisable to have a link cable, as deploying a build to the headset, each time you test is not very practical, and would be time consuming. </p><p>Please use Udemy's Q &amp; A, for any explanations you seek from my end, related to this course.</p><p>This course will continue to be updated, as new VR mechanics evolve. </p><p><strong>Become a VR Game Developer now, and create some amazing Games!</strong></p><p>- Chris, <br>Game Works</p>",

In this beginner-friendly course, you'll be introduced to the fundamentals of Gaea, learning how to create realistic terrains from scratch and import them into Unreal Engine.</p><p><em>UPDATE 25th October 2024:</em><strong><em> Videos on Gaea 2 are in the making, the first video is already included in the course (How to install and use the Gaea 2 plugin for Unreal Engine).</em></strong></p><p>This course is ideal for beginners interested in 3D environments. You'll start with the basics of Gaea and get a brief introduction to Unreal Engine. A significant portion of the course focuses on using Gaea's graph-based node editor, allowing you to harness its power to create stunning terrains.</p><p>No prior experience with Gaea or Unreal Engine is required. Both software options offer free versions, making this course accessible to anyone eager to explore terrain creation.</p><p>You'll discover how Gaea's node-based system enables non-destructive creation and how procedural generation techniques can effectively mimic natural formations. After completing your work in Gaea, we'll move on to exporting the terrain and importing it into Unreal Engine 5.</p><p><em>Please note that this is a Gaea-focused course. It does not cover foliage, materials, etc. in Unreal Engine. However, by the end of the course, you'll have a terrain in Unreal Engine, ready for further decoration.</em></p>",

  "description": "<p>1. Understanding Game Design &amp; Planning</p><p>Before we start building, we will go over the key elements that make a great escape game:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ==&gt;&nbsp; How to structure an engaging escape room experience</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;==&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;Designing puzzles that are fun and challenging</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;==&gt;&nbsp; Placing clues and items logically to guide the player</p><p>2. Creating the 3D Game Environment</p><p>You will learn how to build a realistic house where the game takes place. This includes:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;==&gt;&nbsp; Setting up rooms, furniture, and decorations</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;==&gt;&nbsp; Creating interactive objects like doors, drawers, and secret compartments</p><p>3. Implementing Puzzle Mechanics</p><p>The core of your game will be the puzzles! You’ll learn how to add different types of challenges, such as:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;==&gt; Item-based puzzles – Finding a key to unlock a door</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;==&gt; Code puzzles – Using clues to figure out a combination lock</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;==&gt; Object interactions – Moving furniture to reveal hidden items</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;==&gt; Logic puzzles – Arranging objects in the right order to trigger an event</p><p>4. Player Interaction &amp; Inventory System</p><p>We will implement systems that allow players to interact with objects, pick up items, and use them later. This includes:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;==&gt; Clicking on objects to examine and collect them</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;==&gt; Creating an inventory system to store and use collected items</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;==&gt; Combining items to solve more complex puzzles</p><p>5. Game Logic &amp; Scripting</p><p>To bring everything to life, we will use scripting (such as C# in Unity) to:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ==&gt; Control how objects react to player actions</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ==&gt;&nbsp; Implement timers, triggers, and conditions for puzzles</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ==&gt;&nbsp; Manage game progress and story elements</p>",

To go along side the states and transitions are StateMachineBehaviour scripts which let you queue up changes and effects for your characters when entering or leaving states. For instance, this is very helpful when you want to make a character jump upon entering a jump state when the jump action is pressed on your keyboard.&nbsp;To make player input go smoothly, we use the new InputSystem to set keybinds to actions and respond to those actions triggering through UnityEvents. To make the game more complete, we make use of Cinemachine follow camera, parallax background, health pickups, sound, and tilesets to continue building out our demo game. Many of the scripts are intentionally designed to be reusable like the Damageable script which lets any character take damage or be healed on triggering events.</p><p><br></p><p>The final course <strong>project with all source</strong> files are provided in the course <strong>for you to use</strong> or reference in any of your own projects!</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Player Controller, Movement and Physics</p></li><li><p>Animation State Machines for Players and Enemy Characters</p></li><li><p>Dealing Damage to Player and Enemy Characters</p></li><li><p>Working with Tilemaps and Tilesets to Build Game Levels</p></li><li><p>Basic Enemy AI Patterns</p></li><li><p>Ranged Attacks</p></li><li><p>Aerial Attacks</p></li><li><p>Combo Attacks</p></li><li><p>AnimationStateBehaviours for triggering changes on events</p></li><li><p>Healing Health Pickups</p></li><li><p>Music &amp; Sound</p></li><li><p>How to Export a Game</p></li><li><p>Cinemachine Follow Camera</p></li><li><p>Input System Actions and UnityEvents for handling player input</p></li><li><p>Floating damage text</p></li><li><p>And more...</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>I have done so many of the regular projects out there, such as a tic tac toe, chess, hangman, asteroids, connect 4, but all of these projects felt small and I found there to not be much variety when it comes to game tutorials. </p><p>Most tutorials all cover the same games, with only variations in how they are coded. I also found that most tutorials, do not go through every element of a game, such as the start screen, all of the power ups, the score screens, etc.</p><p>They usually only take you as far as the basic building blocks, and then leave you to create the rest, should you wish to continue.<br>Most of these tutorials, have left me with a directory filled with what would be deemed as unfinished games.<br>Hence I thought it would be great to put together a course on creating a game, with all of the game elements created and implemented in a step by step process, that leaves you at the end of the course, with a fully functional, and complete game. </p><p>My hope is that you are able to understand how each element of this game is created and implemented, so that you gain further insight when deciding to tackle a challenge of your own. </p><p>I also find the old games from the 80's and 90's as fantastic coding challenges, in particular when it comes to trying to understand how something may have been implemented.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This crash-course is about machine Learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence with Unity3D.</p><p><strong>Why using Unity3D for Artificial Intelligence?</strong></p><p>Unity3D is the perfect environment in order to train your own AIs. Let’s take the example of a Self-driving Car. What you need is complex environments where there are a lots of realistic physical interactions. You could provide these datas from interactions with the real world, but this is extreme inefficient and time consuming.</p><p>Since games become more and more realistic you can provide these informations from virtual environments. And for that Unity is perfectly positioned.</p><p>So, no matter if you are a game developer who wants to create AIs for games or if you are a hobby researcher who just want to play with machine Learning … The ML-Agents toolkit is the perfect start in order to create your own AIs.</p><p><strong><br>What do we learn in this crash-course?</strong></p><p>This course is structured into 4 major sections:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Introduction<br></strong>This section covers everything in order to get a quick start with the ML-Agents Toolkit. You will learn:</p><p>-Set up of the ML-Agents toolkit with Tensorflow<br>-What is a neural-network?<br>-The Key Components of the Ml-Agents toolkit</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>3D Roller Ball AI</strong></p><p>This lecture will give you a first impression of the Ml-Agents toolkit in practice. You will learn how to set up the environment and all the necessary components in order to train the AI.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>A.I. learns to play Flappy Bird</strong></p><p>Instead wasting your time with playing this game, we will code our own A.I. that learns to play Flappy Bird by using Reinforcement Learning.</p><p>After training the AI is able to achieve an unlimited score in this game.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Self-driving Car</strong></p><p>The Self-driving Car is the probably the most famous example for Artificial Intelligence, so we will cover this as well. To train the Car we will use a technique called Imitation Learning.</p><p>Imitation Learning is special, because this method uses the inputs from a human Player in order to train the neural network.</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the Mobile Game Development Course in which we will <strong>Reverse Engineer</strong>, <strong>Architect</strong>, and <strong>Develop </strong>a mobile version of the famous Chrome Dinosaur Game uing the Flame Game Engine with Flutter and Dart.<br><br><strong><em>Why Develop Mobile Games?</em><br></strong>Mobile Games are by far the largest share of Game Application revenue in the world. More than 50% of all game application development comes from Mobile games.</p><p>Being able to code Mobile Games offers great potential in such a large market.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Why Flame Engine</em></strong></p><p>The Flame Engine is a minimalist 2D game engine that runs on top of the Flutter framework. So it is light-weight with a small footprint.</p><p>This is perfect for mobile games.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Advantages of The Flutter Framework</em></strong></p><p>You work with <strong>one code base</strong> but get <strong>multiple platform deployment</strong>. Basically write once, and deploy to both <strong><em>iOS </em></strong>and <strong><em>Android</em></strong>. This is a huge advantage as it saves you time and effort.</p><p>And this is great for mobile games since we do not rely on the specific OS GUI as we basically take over the screen and create our own GUI from scratch.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Why Take this course?</em></strong></p><p>In this course we will teach you how to go through the full <strong>game development cycle</strong> and you will learn how to <strong>develop a mobile game from scratch.</strong></p><p><br></p><ol><li><p>We will start with the game idea</p></li><li><p>We will then reverse engineer this idea into game requirements</p><ol><li><p>they will include the game elements </p></li><li><p>and the game mechanics</p></li></ol></li><li><p>We will then consider the game aesthetics</p></li><li><p>We will create a game architecture</p></li><li><p>And then we will fully develop the game.</p></li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Assumptions</em></strong></p><p>We assume that you know Flutter/Dart and have worked with it.<br>We also assume that you have some knowledge of the Flame Engine. This could be either through an introductory course such as \"<strong>Flame &amp; Flutter with Dart : Build your First 2D Mobile Game\" </strong>which is offered on Udemy or through some online tutorials.</p><p>Everything in this course will be explained in detail including the code so you do not have to be an expert.</p><p><br><strong><em>What will you learn?</em></strong></p><p>This course will teach you not just to code the game but it will teach you the full scope of the game development cycle.</p><p>The Chrome Dinosaur game is an example of a very popular game genre which is the Endless Runner Game and also known as Infinite Runner Game.</p><p>Developing any game from scratch is a great exercise that will not only make you a better game developer but it will also help you master the Flame Game Engine API so that you will be able to create your own games.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reverse Engineering </strong>a Game is a very important skill for a game developer and we will look carefully at every detail of the game mechanics and the game elements for the Chrome Dino game, and we will map the mechanics and the elements into an architecture which we will then develop.</p><p><br></p><p>We will use efficient sprite animation as well as simple sound design. We will map out all the individual game elements and their mechanics and then we will combine them into more complex behavior. For example we will combine the mechanics of our Dino and the obstacles to include Collision Detection in the most efficient and architecturally sound manner.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Milestone approach</em></strong></p><p>Part of how we teach you in this course revolves around practical case studies. Each case study shows you a full solution to a given element of 2D game coding such as for example Animation or Collision Detection.</p><p><br></p><p>Each milestone will build on the previous one which is one of the most important skills in software development. We will build for ease of modification and ease of enhancement.</p>",

    "To complete the project presented in this course you only need  Unity 2018 (or a more recent version) and to also ensure that your computer and its operating system comply with Unity’s requirements. Unity can be downloaded from the official website and before downloading, you can check that your computer is up to scratch.",
    "In terms of computer skills, all knowledge introduced in this course will assume no prior programming experience from you. So for now, you only need to be able to perform common computer tasks, such as downloading items, opening and saving files, be comfortable with dragging and dropping items and typing, and relatively comfortable with Unity’s interface. This being said, because the focus of this course is on scripting, and while all steps are explained step-by-step, you may need to be relatively comfortable with Unity’s interface, as well as creating and transforming objects.",
    "So, if you would prefer to become more comfortable with Unity prior to start scripting, you can take the first course in the series called Unity From Zero to Proficiency (Foundations). This course covers most of the shortcuts and views available in Unity, as well as how to perform common tasks in Unity such as creating objects, transforming objects, importing assets, using navigation controllers, or exporting the game to the web."

YOU CAN JUST SKIP THE PART WHERE I TEACH THE STUDENTS ABOUT HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH CLIENTS AND BASIC SALES TECHNIQUES</strong></p><p>Do you dream of building your own <strong>multiplayer games in Unity</strong>? Are you a <strong>freelancer</strong> looking to expand your skill set and <strong>take on more clients</strong>? Look no further than this comprehensive Unity game development course!</p><p>In this course, you will learn how to <strong>create engaging multiplayer games</strong> using the power of Photon PUN2 and PlayFab. With step-by-step guidance, you'll gain a deep understanding of the Photon multiplayer framework and how to integrate it with PlayFab's backend services. From matchmaking and player synchronization to leaderboards, you'll master the tools and techniques necessary to create seamless online gaming experiences.</p><p>With a focus on real-world scenarios, this course will teach you how to create an end-to-end multiplayer game from scratch. You'll start with the basics of Unity and C# programming, and then dive into Photon's powerful multiplayer features. You'll learn <strong>how to set up a PlayFab account, integrate it with Photon, and build a fully-functional multiplayer game</strong>.</p><p>Whether you're an experienced Unity developer or a beginner looking to break into the industry, this course has something for everyone. By the end of the course, you'll have the skills and confidence to create your own multiplayer games in Unity and succeed as a freelancer in the game development industry.</p><p>Enroll now and take the first step toward building your own online gaming empire</p><p>In this course, I will teach you everything that you need to know to start freelancing as a Unity Game Developer. I will cover <strong>most of the important features that clients on online marketplaces such as Fiverr, Upwork and Guru require.</strong> I will:</p><p>- <strong>Teach you how to communicate with clients and how to respond to various types of clients</strong></p><p>- <strong>Teach you how to</strong> <strong>Gather requirements and define modules for your client so you can get paid consistently</strong></p><p>- <strong>Teach you how to send videos to your clients to show the work that you have done and then get paid for that</strong></p><p>To do this we will develop a <strong>2D Multiplayer Game Using Unity with Photon PUN for multiplayer integration, and PlayFab as a back-end for storing user data. </strong>We will:</p><p>- <strong>Create a 2D platformer from scratch using free graphics. We will pretend that the client provided those graphics to us</strong></p><p>- <strong>Create a login, register, and verification system using Playfab as a backend</strong></p><p>- <strong>Use Photon PUN&nbsp;and its various features to setup random online matches between players.</strong></p><p>The objective of the game (we will pretend that the objective was given to us by the client) will be to <strong>reach to the end of the level before the opponent does. The Multi-player levels will include:</strong></p><p>- <strong>Traps and Pits the the player has to either jump over or avoid</strong></p><p>- <strong>Enemies with basic AI. They will try to attack the player and either cause a game over or slow the player down</strong></p><p>- <strong>A complete system where when one player reaches the end, the game automatically ends with one player winning and the other losing</strong></p><p>As we will be using <strong>Photon PUN, the player avatars will not be able to fire back at the enemies or use any projectile system, since we will cover only basic synchronization which itself is a task that even AAA&nbsp;studios struggle with.</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>This project is the world's biggest <strong>on-demand tutorial series</strong> designed to teach ANYONE how to code and build impressive games with the Unreal Engine.</p><p><strong>Benefits of Learning Unreal</strong></p><p>Popular - Unreal is a free game development engine used by developers all the way from beginner indie developers to AAA studios. The community is large and available for help.</p><p>Powerful - Unreal is a powerful engine, with a huge library of image assets available for you to use as much as humanly possible, saving hours of development time.</p><p>High Definition - Unreal is one of the main engines to use because it is so good at making good looking and high quality games. Unreal has high fidelity, meaning you can zoom in and still have high quality images.</p><p>Coding Optional - The best part about Unreal is their blueprint system, letting you build games without coding. We have been using Unreal technologies since UDK and are delighted to see that the blueprint system is incredibly robust and resource-efficient.</p><p>Resource-Efficient - You can minimize loss of performance by a large amount simply by using Blueprints.</p><p>Other Industries - Unreal is for more than just game development. You can get hired in filmmaking, architectural design and product visualization, to name a few.</p><p>For instance, Mcclaren Automotive uses Unreal to let users visualize their own unique luxury car before building it. Unreal Engine has even been used to build Star Wars-themed areas in Disney World and Disneyland.</p><p>The Weather Channel used mixed reality to visualize Hurricane Florence's floods.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This is a course of advanced vehicle mechanics using Unreal Engine and Blueprint. The course begins with drivable vehicle mechanics. And we will also implement engine sound system and action camera mechanics in this section.</p><p>In the next section we will implement racing functionality. We will make a AI racing car which will be potent enough to beat the player car. In this section we will also make use of line trace and build collision avoidance system. In this section our focus will be to make a racing car which will maximize the speed taking care of safety.</p><p>Next we will use unreal's navigation system and will implement some Chasing Mechanics. Where we will develop a police car which will chase the player. Also when the player car is out of their sight they will roam around at some random location in search of the player car. </p><p>This course requires some experience with Unreal Engine. If you have previously created any project using unreal then you are good to follow along with this course.</p><p>This course can boost your ability to program with blueprint. You will learn a lots of techniques here. Starting from Input key mapping up to advanced racing and chasing mechanics. There is no such course available on the internet with this topic till now. And I am really glad to share these knowledges with you.</p>",

Also, entire game is written without use of an update method, so you will learn how to create your games without it.

Do you want to learn how to build car racing games in Unity using C# code? Growing up, racing games always fascinated me. I was intrigued by how the in-game physics was so realistic and how they simulated driving in the game so accurately. This course will teach you how to build a full racing game in Unity, even if you are a beginner. By the end of this course, you will have a full car racing game that you built in Unity from the ground up. </p><p><br></p><p>As we build this course, you are going to gain a wealth of knowledge in the different areas of the Unity game engine. Some of the core game development techniques this course will teach you are:</p><ul><li><p>Using C# logic to create <strong>SELF-DRIVING&nbsp;AI&nbsp;CARS</strong> driving around the track and competing against the player in races.</p></li><li><p>Implementing a <strong>HOT&nbsp;PURSUIT&nbsp;MODE</strong> where police cars chase the player.</p></li><li><p>Working with Unity's Physics system and understanding how to use components like <strong>WHEEL&nbsp;COLLIDERS</strong> and Rigidbodies to simulate vehicle movement and interaction with the environment.</p></li><li><p>Utilizing Unity's UI system to build a <strong>MINI-MAP</strong> and other racing heads up displays like a speedometer.</p></li><li><p>Writing reusable code that can be applied to several different sections of the game. Object-oriented C# scripting techniques for writing<strong> CLEAN, REUSABLE&nbsp;CODE</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Learn about the different UI components and how they can be used together to build <strong>IN-GAME&nbsp;MENUS</strong> and selection screens that efficiently and intuitively respond to user input.</p></li><li><p>Turn your ideas into code using C# with Unity and build up a set of skills that you can use to build other <strong>CAR&nbsp;RACING&nbsp;GAMES</strong> and showcase them in your portfolio.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>By the end of this course, you will have a full game project you developed from the ground up! You will also have some more C# tips and tricks that you can add to your arsenal. </p><p><br></p><p>If you want to learn game development or are aspiring to build a career in the game industry, then this course is for you!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Most tutorials on making a Metahuman playable using the Third Person template teach you how to do it by following a list of steps. This course teaches you what those steps actually <em>do</em> — and <em>why</em> they matter.</p><p>As a Gold-tier Unreal Authorized Instructor, an Unreal Animation Fellow, and a generalist focused on all things Unreal Engine, including Virtual Production, Game Design, and Cinematics, I understand just how fast Unreal Engine is developing and changing. Understanding how the engine ticks (pun intended!) is key to your ability to thrive using Unreal Engine and problem solve when things don't work as expected.</p><p>In this focused, under-2-hour course, you’ll gain an <strong>architectural understanding</strong> of how Unreal Engine 5 spawns and controls characters, including Metahumans, and deep dive into the third person template. Instead of overwhelming you with features, we go deep into <strong>core principles</strong> like:</p><ul><li><p>Inheritance and Composition</p></li><li><p>Game Mode and Default Pawn Class</p></li><li><p>Blueprint Class Hierarchies</p></li><li><p>Live Animation Retargeting</p></li><li><p>Character Movement Components</p></li></ul><p>You’ll learn to bring in a Metahuman and make them playable using the Third Person template — not by blindly replacing meshes, but by understanding the <strong>underlying systems</strong> used by the Third Person template. You are encouraged to break things and find your way back again, asking WHY -- that is the way.&nbsp; </p><p>Whether you're working in indie games, virtual production, or animation, these are the kind of Unreal Engine fundamentals that will <strong>unlock everything else</strong>.</p><p>By the end, you’ll be confident not just in using Metahumans — but in using the Third Person template for your own projects.</p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course we’ll learn how to write correct, safe, and performant code by making use of C++’s type system. Firstly, we’ll learn about the Standard Library’s “algebraic data types” and how they can increase safety, performance, and readability of your application/library. We’ll then look at function interfaces. As an example, writing a function that takes a string in such a way that it performs optimally with both std::string and const char* seems like a daunting task. It gets even more tricky with functions taking other functions as input. Is it possible to generalize these issues and provide the “perfect” interface?</p><p><strong>About the Author :</strong></p><p><strong>Vittorio Romeo</strong> is a Software Engineer at Bloomberg LP. He completed his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at \"Università degli Studi di Messina\".</p>\n\n<p>He began programming at a very young age and is now a C++ enthusiast. While following the evolution of the C++ standard and embracing the newest features, he worked on several open-source projects, including modern general-purpose libraries and free cross-platform games.</p>\n\n<p>Vittorio is an active member of the C++ community: he participated as a speaker at CppCon 2014/2015/2016, ++it Florence 2015 and at his local Linux Day 2013/2014 events, as a Student/Volunteer at C++Now 2015/2016, at Meeting C++ 2015/2016.</p>\n\n<p>He currently maintains a C++-related blog and a YouTube channel featuring well-received modern C++11 and C++14 tutorials.</p>\n\n<p>When he's not writing code, Vittorio enjoys weightlifting and fitness-related activities, competitive/challenging computer gaming and good sci-fi movies/TV-series.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This is a course which is made specifically for the Unreal Engine 5 absoute beginners. Everything will be explained in details and it assumes you know nothing about Unreal Engine and it assumes you have no previous programming experience. This course teaches you the most needed essentials of the Unreal Engine 5 Bluerpint Visual Scripting to get you started. After this course, you'll fell confident taking other project based tutorials or courses. </p><p>We will start from installing the development environment including the Unreal Engine editors. Then we'll give you a gentle introduction to the Unreal Engine Editor and the first person template project, just to get you familiar with the basics of the Unreal Engine 5 editor.</p><p>After that, we will introduce you to programming and explain the most important programming concepts including variable, value types and the basic data structures.</p><p>Then we will go through the most important blueprint programming nodes.</p><p>Finally, we will teach you blueprint communications which are essentials to any games you're going to develop in the future.</p><p>Before any practical coding, we will use diagrams and presentations to give you a clear picture what we're going to do and why&nbsp; we're going to do it like that.&nbsp; And we will repeat important concepts until you fully understand them.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Video games need math to work</strong> - there's no getting around it. 2D and 3D graphics, AI, sound, animations, physics are all applications of math and knowing how the core principles of math work is required in order to have a good grasp on all of them.</p><p>We're going to learn<strong> core math concepts used in game development</strong>. Unlike other courses that teach math, we're going to apply the math we learn by programming challenging exercises to achieve interesting effects in 2D graphics and animation that give real <strong>polish</strong> to our game - Asteroids. These techniques are fundamental and can be used for a variety of applications through all of game development.</p><p>This isn't a typical a boring math class where I write equations on the board. Pretty much all of <strong>the math lectures and applications use fun animations</strong> that give you a good <strong>VISUAL intuition behind the math</strong>. This is more important than just memorizing formulas like you did in high school. I show you why a math concept is important, the intuition behind it through fun animations, the applications of the concepts in a real game you'll have the source code to, <strong>THEN </strong>you'll use those concepts to make the game even better <strong>by applying your knowledge to make fun 2D graphic effects</strong>.</p><p><strong>In the course you'll learn:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Sine and Cosine</p></li><li><p>Radians</p></li><li><p>Linear Interpolation</p></li><li><p>Vectors</p></li><li><p>Rays</p></li><li><p><strong>How to apply your math knowledge</strong></p></li><li><p>Lots more!</p></li></ul><p>By the end of the course, you'll have a better understanding of <strong>how to apply math</strong> in video games and the <strong>intuition behind core math concepts in games</strong>. You'll even have enough math knowledge to figure out how to <strong>cut an asteroid in half</strong>!</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>There’s no risk!</em></strong></p><p>This course comes with a&nbsp;<strong>full 30 day money-back guarantee</strong>. If you are not completely satisfied with the course, Udemy will refund you what you paid - no questions asked.</p><p><strong>Register for the course today!</strong></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>This course will teach everything you need to build a complete 2D game in Godot 4! We start from the very basics, downloading Godot 4 and program every single line together until building the game out to a .exe file. Some of the topics we will cover are:</p><ul><li><p>Working with player input</p></li><li><p>Working across multiple scenes</p></li><li><p>Signals and subscribers</p></li><li><p>Creating and customizing the user interface</p></li><li><p>Saving and loading</p></li><li><p>Debugging</p></li><li><p>&amp; more</p></li></ul><p>The goal of this course is to familiarize yourself with the complete game development workflow through Godot. By the end of this course you should have a functional proficiency with GDScript and basic software engineering principals. You will be able to improve upon the game you have built in this course, build your own games, or even take your new skill set to other game engines or software projects entirely.</p><p>This course is ideal for you if you are looking to get into programming or game development. 2D games are a critical introduction to game development, even if you are looking to get into 3D game development. While this course was recorded on Windows, these processes are identical on Linux as well.</p><p>This course is action oriented and focused on the process of creating a classic 2D game from start to finish. While the game allows us to cover a wide range of topics in Godot, we do not cover things such as networked multiplayer, 3D, art and animations, etc. Please review the course content to see if the course would be helpful for you.</p><p>There are several lessons that are available for preview here on Udemy, please check them out ahead of time to see if my teaching style or the content of the course is right for you!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Important:</strong> <strong>all software used are FREE to download and use on PC, LINUX and MAC computers</strong> (no need to pay, cheers!)</p><p>In this course you will learn how to use Unity3D to build a professional multiplayer combat system.</p><p>Why would you want to learn how to build a combat system? Because any good online multiplayer game out there uses a combat system where players can fight eachother in player versus player mode and players can also team up together to fight powerful enemies and bosses. This is the core foundation of multiplayer games.&nbsp;</p><p>All the great games out there are using it, look at Star Wars, or World of Warcraft or MineCraft or even Pokemon. That's exactly what you will be making by taking this course. We will start by creating melee combat using shields and sword fighting and then we will go into ranged combat using magic firebolts and bows and arrows. Isn't it exciting already?</p><p>This course can be taken by anyone even if you've got no programming skills. This course is meant for non-artists, meaning you don't have to be an artist to be able to use 3D pixel art graphics since this course provides all the necessary assets for you. The only tool we use in this course is Unity 3D, and it's completely free to use. No need to spend extra money.</p><p>This course is easy to follow along since all the steps are shown to you in the video lectures, so you can't possibly miss a step, and it's a lot more fun that reading documentation</p><p><br></p><p>The skills that are taught in this course are the foundation of any professional video games and they can be applied to all your future projects.&nbsp;</p><p>Join the course now, you've got nothing to lose because if i don't deliver, you'll get a full refund. I'll see you in the videos lectures and in the course forum.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Hi all, </p><p>Here you will learn about Unreal C++ basics. We will start by comparing why we should use C++ over the blueprint and what architecture does Unreal C++ uses and What is the basic functionality of all the classes and their hierarchy. </p><ul><li><p>We will start making a Car Race game and make a Generic Car base with Wheel Suspension. </p></li><li><p>We will learn how to add a Car light system with Material Parameter Collection in Cpp. </p></li><li><p>We will add the smoke exhaust system, Skid system, Nitrous System. </p></li><li><p>We will add Speedometer with Material and C++ implementation. </p></li><li><p>We will add Rear Mirror System.</p></li><li><p>We will radio system which can be changed runtime. </p></li><li><p>For attack, We will add a Rocket launcher and target missile launcher.&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>We will make the Behavior tree component all in C++ with coving all the basics of behavior trees. </p></li><li><p>We will Add Car AIs</p></li><li><p>We will add Vehicle damage System </p></li></ul><p>By the end of the course, you can use your knowledge of C++ and Blueprints to <strong>build your own dream games</strong>. You can use the games built during this course for your personal projects moving forward, as you add more advanced features. Even if you thought C++ was difficult or intimidating before taking this course, you will learn how easy it is to code C++ within Unreal Engine 4 once you go through these lectures. Even if you are only interested in single-player type games, this course will be a great fit as it teaches many other concepts besides programming for multiplayer games.</p><p><strong>Why Learn From Me</strong></p><p>In this course, you will learn more than just programming in Unreal Engine 4. You will actually <strong>follow the ‘Unreal Way’ of making games in this Epic Games-approved course. </strong>Start off on the right foot and write effective C++ code using methods the engine creators have used themselves! I have been working with Unreal Engine 4 and creating game development tutorials since day one. Through this partnership with Epic Games, you will gain the skills to create stunning new projects and advance your professional aspirations in game development.</p><p><strong>Who this course is for:</strong></p><ul><li><p>People who have tried C++ with Unreal before but could not find the right tutorial to support their hands-on learning style. This course offers step-by-step guidance and lots of activities so you can master making games with C++.</p></li><li><p>Developers from Unity3D and other engines looking to dive into Unreal Engine programming.</p></li><li><p>If you have never touched a programming language before this course may not be for you. However, proficiency in Unreal’s Blueprint visual scripting also counts as a valid foundation for this course as it shares the same concepts as languages like C++.</p></li><li><p>If you are an artist who wants to bring your ideas to life in a game, a Blueprint-focused course might be a better fit for you. Skim the course curriculum to see if you’re interested in using the power of C++, networking, and AI programming to build out the technical structure of your game.</p></li></ul><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Hi all, </p><p>Here you will learn about Unreal C++ basics. We will start by comparing why we should use C++ over the blueprint and what architecture does Unreal C++ uses and What is the basic functionality of all the classes and their hierarchy. </p><ul><li><p>We will start making an open-world game and make Generic characters and NPC</p></li><li><p>You will learn how to make AIs spawning system works in the open-world game.</p></li><li><p>we will add Pedestrian systems, fighting system, and hand combat system all at run time. </p></li><li><p>The course also contains how to make an AI behavior tree and its component in C++. </p></li><li><p>We will make Behavior tree component all in C++ with coving all the basics of behavior trees. </p></li></ul><p>By the end of the course, you can use your knowledge of C++ and Blueprints to <strong>build your own dream games</strong>. You can use the games built during this course for your personal projects moving forward, as you add more advanced features. Even if you thought C++ was difficult or intimidating before taking this course, you will learn how easy it is to code C++ within Unreal Engine 4 once you go through these lectures. Even if you are only interested in single-player type games, this course will be a great fit as it teaches many other concepts besides programming for multiplayer games.</p><p><strong>Why Learn From Me</strong></p><p>In this course, you will learn more than just programming in Unreal Engine 4. You will actually <strong>follow the ‘Unreal Way’ of making games in this Epic Games-approved course. </strong>Start off on the right foot and write effective C++ code using methods the engine creators have used themselves! I have been working with Unreal Engine 4 and creating game development tutorials since day one. Through this partnership with Epic Games, you will gain the skills to create stunning new projects and advance your professional aspirations in game development.</p><p><strong>Who this course is for:</strong></p><ul><li><p>People who have tried C++ with Unreal before but could not find the right tutorial to support their hands-on learning style. This course offers step-by-step guidance and lots of activities so you can master making games with C++.</p></li><li><p>Developers from Unity3D and other engines looking to dive into Unreal Engine programming.</p></li><li><p>If you have never touched a programming language before this course may not be for you. However, proficiency in Unreal’s Blueprint visual scripting also counts as a valid foundation for this course as it shares the same concepts as languages like C++.</p></li><li><p>If you are an artist who wants to bring your ideas to life in a game, a Blueprint-focused course might be a better fit for you. Skim the course curriculum to see if you’re interested in using the power of C++, networking, and AI programming to build out the technical structure of your game.</p></li></ul><p><br></p>",

All lectures that are free to try should have a \"Preview\" button next to them. Check it out!</p><p><em>Note: This course was made using Unity 5.2. Any version of Unity 5 is compatible with this course. Also, all scripting is 100% done from scratch.</em></p><p><strong>What is the course about?</strong></p><p>This course is all about learning game development using the Unity3D Game Engine. We will be covering topics that go all the way from installing the engine, to making a character move in world, to creating very simple AI.</p><p>C# experience is recommended, <strong>but not required</strong> as I explain absolutely everything about what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. Although this course is mostly programming, I also take the time to go through the interface, set up basic animations in Mecanim (Unity's animation system), and use most of the commonly used windows within the interface. </p><p>There are always multiple ways to do things in game development. Because I want you to keep an open mind as to the possibilities Unity brings you, when I'm doing something that may feel repetitive, I always go about it a different way. This way you will end up getting more familiar with the engine.</p><p><em>Although this course is the perfect foundation to start as a Unity Developer, all learning levels should benefit from this course one way or another because of the different ways in which I approach situations. That being said, this course is meant for beginner level students.</em><br></p><p><strong>What's included in the course?</strong></p><ul><li><em>30 Lectures, 29 videos and 6 hours of content</em></li><li>All art/sound assets</li><li>The finalized version of the Unity Project we are going to be creating</li></ul><p><strong>How is the course structured?</strong></p><p>This course is divided into 3 sections. </p><p>The first section is all about learning your way through the engine. In this section, I show you where to go to install the engine, go through the commonly used windows in the interface, and talk about terminology Unity Developers use on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>The second section is about creating the player's and all the enemies' behaviors in game. There are a total of 3 enemies (robots, laser fences, and security cameras).</p><p>The third section is about finalizing the environment by adding sounds and a few other things that bring the environment to life. In this section, we'll also be making a build of the application for use by the end user.</p><p><strong>What should you expect by the end of the course?</strong></p><p>By the end of the course, you will be armed with the knowledge necessary to feel confident/comfortable when using the engine for your own projects. Learning new things within the engine should be very easy at this point.</p><p><br></p><p><em>If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me and I'll be happy to reply as soon as possible.</em></p><p><em><br></em></p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em></em>All videos where recorded in 1080p. In order to take advantage of this level of quality, make sure you have 1080p as the selected quality in the video player</p>",

Because any good online multiplayer game out there uses a chat system where players can easily interact with eachother by sending text messages and receiving other player's messages back. This is a must-have in any online multiplayer games.&nbsp;</p><p>All the great games out there are using it, look at Star Wars, or World of Warcraft or MineCraft or even Pokemon. That's exactly what you will be making by taking this course.</p><p>The majority of the courses out there will only teach you how to create a chat system on one computer, but this course goes the beyond by have the chat system work on dozens of players texting eachother at the same time.</p><p>You will start learning how to design the chat window user interface, then you will get to program the code logic to send messages to other players. You will also get to program the code to receive messages from other players and create a chat window where you can scroll through the chat log. We will also go beyond and have the player name of the person sending the message, as well as add color coding to easily know who is sending the messages.</p><p>***</p><p>This course provides all the necessary assets for you. The only tool we use in this course is Unity 3D, and it's completely free to use. No need to spend extra money.</p><p>This course is easy to follow along since all the steps are shown to you in the video lectures, so you can't possibly miss a step.&nbsp;</p><p>Please join the course now. You've got nothing to lose because if i don't deliver, you'll get a full refund. I'll see you in the course.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

The course will focus on a Vector generated cartoon stylized format seen in many games.  </p>  <p>  \t                            Learn to build assets in a simple format, by breaking objects down into individual components and building up the details of each component to a final result.  </p>  <p>  \t                                      This course will take several hours to complete, if you follow along step by step in the process.  We will begin with very simple objects, and then move along into more and more complex designs as we progress.  </p>  <p>  \t                            By the end of this course, you will have created several small props, along with multiple fantasy swords, shields, a treasure chest, and a detailed guillotine as the final project  </p>  <p>  \t                            This course is structured to teach you the basics of the DrawplusX6 application although other vector programs like inkscape can work just as well.  If you are familiar or more comfortable with a different vector application then following the steps should be easily transferable to that application.  </p>  <p>  \t                            Once you understand the basics of how to build objects, and add details and shading to them, you will be able to create most any game component you require in your games.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">What this course will teach you:</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                            What is a vector and how to use vector shapes to build art for games.  </p>  <p>  \t                                      How to navigate the interface and use the primary tools within the DrawPlusX6 application.  </p>  <p>  \t                            How to view reference photos, and rough in general shapes, to gradually build up a complete object.  </p>  <p>  \t                            How to use existing shapes, to create the necessary shading to add detail and depth to your objects.  </p>  <p>  \t                            How to create several objects, walking through the process from concept/reference to completed, exported image file.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">What this course will not teach you:</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                            This course will not go into details on creating characters or monsters or entire game levels, as it will be focused on individual objects/props.  </p>",

  "description": "<p>This course teaches the new 2d tools and features of Unity 2017, including the Tilemap and Timeline Editor tools. These features are completely new to Unity and allow developers to <strong>develop 2d games quicker and more effectively</strong>. This course is geared towards beginners but is a great choice for any Unity developer looking to learn how to use Unity’s latest tools and features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Tilemap Tool</strong> allows users to paint sprites onto a grid to facilitate rapid and more precise prototyping and 2d level design. The <strong>Timeline Editor</strong>, powered by cinemachine, allows developers and animators to easily coordinate complex cutscenes by providing one timeline that can visually layout the animations of several game objects at once.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course, we will use these two core features of <strong>Unity 2017</strong> to build a 2d platformer game level. <strong>We will build a splash screen, animated cutscene, playable third person character, artificially intelligent enemies, in-game collectibles, and a 2d level.</strong> By the end of this course you will have hands-on experience implementing all of these game features using Unity’s latest 2d tools.  \n\n</p><p>The<strong> full project</strong> made in this course is attached as a resource to the course. So if you get stuck for any reason, you have both the full project as well as myself that you can reach out to for help! </p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Why Use Perforce with Unreal Engine?</strong></p><p>Perforce provides the tools needed to manage large, complex projects, while Unreal Engine’s integration makes it accessible for game developers. From version control to team collaboration, this combination ensures that game development workflows remain smooth, organized, and scalable. Whether you’re developing a solo project or managing a large team, Perforce ensures that your Unreal Engine projects remain secure and easy to manage across their entire lifecycle.</p><p><strong>Perforce (Helix Core)</strong> is a leading version control system widely used in game development, especially for managing large assets and complex projects. <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>, one of the most popular game development platforms, seamlessly integrates with Perforce, making it easier for teams to collaborate and manage project files efficiently.</p><p>Key Benefits of Using Perforce with Unreal Engine:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Efficient Large File Handling</strong>: Unreal projects often contain large binary files, like textures, models, and audio assets. Perforce is optimized for handling these large files, ensuring fast and reliable storage and access.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asset Locking for Collaboration</strong>: With multiple developers working on the same Unreal Engine project, asset conflicts can be common. Perforce's file locking feature prevents team members from overwriting each other’s work by locking assets when someone is working on them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Comprehensive Version Tracking</strong>: Perforce tracks every change made to project files, including who made the changes and when. This ensures a detailed history, making it easier to revert to previous versions or audit changes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Branching and Merging</strong>: For large projects or teams, branching and merging are essential for testing new features, bug fixing, or working on different parts of the project simultaneously. Perforce’s robust branching and merging capabilities make it ideal for complex Unreal Engine projects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seamless Integration with Unreal Engine</strong>: Unreal Engine natively supports Perforce, allowing for an easy setup. Developers can connect their Unreal projects directly to a Perforce repository, enabling smooth version control without leaving the Unreal Engine environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collaboration Across Teams</strong>: Whether working in a small or large team, Perforce enables efficient collaboration. Multiple team members can work on different aspects of the project simultaneously, all while ensuring the integrity of the project files and avoiding conflicts.</p></li></ol><p>Throughout the course, you'll explore the fundamental concepts of Perforce, including setting up a Perforce server, managing repositories, and dealing with common challenges in game development. You'll also get hands-on experience working with Unreal Engine’s specific version control features <strong>UE5 </strong>and <strong>UE4</strong>, ensuring that your projects are well-organized, secure, and easy to scale as they grow.</p><p>By the end of this course, you'll have a strong understanding of how to use Perforce to effectively manage Unreal Engine projects, collaborate with teams, and ensure smooth development pipelines, making you a more efficient and organized game developer.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Nowadays, JavaScript can be used to make games, it brings the question of how good it is to use it for such tasks?. </p><p>Yes Indeed! JavaScript is a great language for game development, depending on the type of game you want to create. JavaScript is best for web-based and mobile games. It’s also a great language for beginners to learn because it’s generally easy to understand and has plenty of libraries and modules available. </p><p>JavaScript games can be played in the browser or mobile phone, so, if that’s your goal, it’s an excellent option. Using platforms and tools can help create both 2D and 3D games that can run directly in your browser.&nbsp; Aside from only web-based games, JavaScript has been increasing in popularity in mobile game development. </p><p><br></p><p>Many popular online games were built using JavaScript. Students who want to create JavaScript game coding can start building one taking examples from one of the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Tower Building:&nbsp;</strong> is a great way to get started with JavaScript games. </p></li><li><p><strong>Bejeweled</strong> was created as an in-browser game in the early 2000s. It’s similar to Candy Crush where you have to match three jewels in a row to score points.</p></li><li><p><strong>2048</strong> is an addicting game that allows you to use your arrow keys to move tiles around in a grid. The idea is to merge tiles until they equal 2048. </p></li><li><p><strong>Polycraft </strong>is a 3D game that is playable in your browser. Polycraft is full of adventure, exploration, base-building, gathering, crafting, and even fighting. It’s an excellent example of how you can move past 2D games with Javascript.</p></li><li><p><strong>Words With Friends 2</strong> is a mobile app game that uses React Native, a framework that utilizes JavaScript to create mobile applications. They chose to use React Native for its ability to create a game that can be played on multiple platforms using JavaScript with one code-base.</p></li></ul><p>See, how fun and rewarding it can be using JavaScript for building games, Let us look at some projects we are going to build in this course:</p><p>1. Hill climbing game:&nbsp;Famous android game but its idea of making vehicle move in hills is never old when it comes to web. We uses different concepts such as webpack, and physics module from phaser library to make this game. </p><p>2. Platformer 2D:&nbsp;we will have detail idea about sprites and how to use them in our games. We will create map (environment)&nbsp;and players from scratch. Different levels will be made and triggers/colliders will be added to make player change from one level to another.</p><p>3. Basics of Phaser library:&nbsp;Different programs to load images, follow camera, loading animations will be created.</p><p><br></p><p>I really enjoyed creating this course. Hope you will also have fun learning. See you at the class!</p>",

  "description": "<p>You have just created a working prototype for your game but there is still that nagging feeling: <strong>will the game's UI impress your players?</strong></p><p>Maybe you thought applying pretty-looking UI elements would take a long time. So, you compromised and went with the default theme. Perhaps, you know how to change the look of some components but you don't want to commit yourself to skin the whole set for fear of changing it altogether if a new look will be picked in the end.</p><p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS</strong></p><p>In this course, you'll start off by skinning the most commonly used UI elements in Godot Engine such as <strong>Button</strong>, <strong>Label</strong>, <strong>CheckBox</strong>, etc. Then, you'll move on to implementing more and more complex UI examples. To that end, you'll be tackling the following topics:</p><ul><li><p>Taking advantage of <strong>themes </strong>in lieu of individually skinning components since themes will let you instantly change how your UI looks.</p></li><li><p>Creating <em>new </em>UI components that are otherwise not part of the game engine.</p></li><li><p>Although changing the look and feel of simple UI components will be necessary, sometimes, it won't be enough. We'll show you how to put simple components together to build a <strong>composite </strong>UI.</p></li></ul><p><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong></p><p>By the end of this course, you'll feel familiar with creating themes and coming up with creative solutions to introduce missing UI options. Ultimately, swapping and combining themes will give you complete flexibility in attaining the look you would like to have for your game. You can even use the same methods if you are using the engine for building desktop applications. </p><p>Now, get in there and create fabulous themes!</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course teaches you how you can create a 2D endless runner game. The player will be jumping obstacles making sure not to hit any of them. We will see how we can spawn different obstacles dynamically on the scene and even add scores to our game. The obstacles will be coming much faster each time making the game have some difficulty. The game will be based on 2D physics with gravity, double jumps, and collision detection working to make a fun experience. We will include sound effects appropriately and use the animation tool that is built into the cocos creator engine. All the files necessary for the course are included and there are no special requirements to be able to participate in this course. This course goes straight to the point of creating a simple 2D endless runner game but gives a good foundation and understanding of the game development principles of Cocos Creator. At the end of the course, you will have a working 2D endless runner game that can be deployed to your preferred platform of choice. Upon completion, the student should be able to understand how to work with the cocos creator component based development paradigm and should be familiar with the common functions and tools used in the engine.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Have you ever <strong>dreamed of making your own video game</strong> but felt overwhelmed by where to start? This beginner-friendly Unity course takes you from absolute zero to building a <strong>fully functional 3D adventure game</strong>, step by step, with no prior coding or game development experience needed.</p><p>Instead of bombarding you with abstract concepts, <strong>we’ll learn by doing</strong>, and with each lecture we’ll gently introduce new concepts and understand how they work. Together, we’ll build a coin-collecting adventure game from scratch, expanding it with movement, animation, traps, enemies, UI, sound, and visual effects.</p><p>This course is not about showing you where to click and what to type. <strong>My goal is to show you why we do things the way we do them</strong>, and in the process transform you into a game developer. You’ll learn to think and execute your plans like a professional. By the end of the course, you will have enough tools at your disposal to kickstart any game project you want to work on.</p><p>Game development is a continuous learning process, I’m not promising you that you’re going to know how to make any game, but this course will give you a solid understanding of the basics, and a strong foundation on which to build. After taking this course, learning game dev is going to become a fun adventure of discovery; with small successes and failures that are an integral part of the journey, and that’s the very core of a fun and rewarding game dev career.</p><ul><li><p>Throughout this course, you'll learn how to create a flexible player controller and how to implement some basic movements like jumping. You'll discover how to use the input system in Unity, how to animate 3D characters, control the camera, and how to play sound effects and create various visual effects to enhance the look and feel of your game.</p></li><li><p>At the beginning of the course, you’ll find a couple of lectures dedicated to teaching you the very basics of programming and using Unity, showing you the most important aspects that you need to be aware of. These are short lectures with plenty of visual aids, most of the programming concepts are sprinkled all throughout the course to help you grasp them in a fun and engaging way.</p></li><li><p>We’ll learn how to create and fine-tune some game mechanics like deadly pits, dangerous spike traps that can either be activated by pressure or with a timer, and sharp spinning blades that are up to no good. Learn to make these the proper way, while making the tools within Unity to edit their parameters and allow us to lay them out easily to make our levels.</p></li><li><p>A game is like a big puzzle, we’ll learn to make some solid puzzle pieces. You can take the knowledge that you acquire here to make more levels, more traps, more ways to move and attack, and innovate on your own, coming up with your own game mechanics.</p></li><li><p>Even advanced Unity developers are sometimes confused about how to create menus and organize their prefabs and scenes in Unity to make a complete game. We’re going to discover some clever ways to keep our project extremely well organized and clean, while remaining flexible and expandable.</p></li><li><p>You’ll learn how to write industry-grade C# code, I have some extremely high standard when it comes to coding, because that’s the lifeblood of your game. Messy code leads to unfinished or abandoned projects, and I’ll give you the best practices to follow to keep your code effective, efficient, and easy to maintain. But most of all, I want you to be able to understand what your code is doing when you come back to it a few weeks later, you’ll be surprised how difficult that is to achieve, it requires high levels of cleanliness and readability.</p></li></ul><p>You’re just one click away from unlocking your game dev super-powers! See you inside!</p>",

  "description": "<p>GODOT 4 is an increasingly popular and, above all, completely free program not only for creating games. Thanks to its unique GDScript language and accessible interface, it is gaining an increasing number of fans.</p><p>In the course, I would like to familiarize you with the basics of using Godot 4 and do it not on the example of dry theories, but on practical short games in which all our attention will be focused on programming and the interface, without unnecessary and time-consuming bells and whistles.</p><p>In the course, you will learn the basics thoroughly, presented in many practical examples, in gradually increasing order of difficulty. Additional modules in the form of prototypes of simple games will allow you to understand when and how given patterns are used.</p><p>Some examples from the course:</p><p> - How to create an Arkanoid game quickly. </p><p>- How to create an endless runner game. </p><p>- Simple top view car game. </p><p>- Some math and drawing in Godot. </p><p>- Tic Tac Toe.</p><p>- Landing on the platform with a spaceship.</p><p>- Simple Quiz.</p><p>Godot version 4 allows you to create games in both 2D and 3D. The special Tiles map system and many other amenities attract especially Indie programmers who create mainly in two dimensions.</p><p>Programming will be taught in GDScript, a language similar to Python and extremely intuitive in its own way. The user-friendliness of the hint system and the encyclopedia of Methods and Classes in GDScript will significantly speed up the learning process. I invite.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This is part 2 In a 3 part series where you will learn how to take an effect from concept to completion and be ready for gameplay implementation. You will learn my production pipeline that has been used in many of my FX throughout AA and AAA game production.&nbsp;</p><p>In Part 2 you will focus more on weapons FX, how they interact with the world, spawn from player logic and animation montages and go deeper into video game production practices. We will dive into using various projectiles and collision responses through blueprint logic. We will tackle different ways of handling projectiles and focus on troubleshooting methods to help better navigate problems that can arise while in a production environment.</p><p>We will dive deeper into materials, exploring more challenging techniques for creating FX. Including multiple UV Maps on FX meshes, animating our muzzle flashes with only one parameter, creating more Material Functions and exposing dynamic and scalar parameters for deeper animation practices for use in our Niagara Systems.</p><p>We will also tackle simulations in Houdini and EmberGen. You will be shown how to pack and export flipbook textures in a way that will help you stay optimized and performant while still delivering high quality gameplay FX. If you do not have access to any of the external software packages used, all of the final textures and meshes will be provided in the course.</p><p>While I recommend starting with Part 1, should you choose to skip it, you will still receive the project file for use along with this course. There will be several things that carry over from Part 1, but you should still be able to manage without them.</p><p>Part 2 is the most massive section of this series and will provide a feature rich learning experience that should give you a more advanced knowledge of how to pull off AAA quality FX for Game Production, so that you can create that stunning portfolio piece that will be sure to catch a recruiters eye.</p><p>So dive on in and lets get crafting!</p>",

  "description": "<p>The main goal of this course, as its name suggests, is to teach you how to perform movement, rotation and scaling of Unity gameobjects. </p><p>In the <strong>Position </strong>section, we will start with the vector math basics. Each lecture represents a task that you could try to do yourself after I give you some theory and code examples. We’ll cover most if not all the ways you can move an object or calculate its position:</p><ul><li><p>By using transform methods</p></li><li><p>By using Matf and Vector methods</p></li><li><p>By applying velocity to the rigidbody</p></li><li><p>By using animation</p></li></ul><p>We’ll cover vector operations such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot and cross products and normalization, and try them out in real game development tasks you might face.</p><p>Next, we’ll take a look how to use Euler Angles and Quaternions in order to <strong>Rotate</strong> your gameobjects. I’ll show you pros and cons of each approach and, of course, provide you with some challenging tasks to solidify your new knowledge.</p><p>Finally, you will work with the <strong>Scale</strong>. In this rather small section you will learn how to change the object size to achieve your goals such as a sprite flip or modifying the parent object without affecting the children. We'll also take a look on how to scale the 4-th dimension - the time itself. </p><p>In this course, you will also learn <strong>how to get input</strong> from different sources such as keyboard, mouse and touchscreen, take a look at <strong>raycasting, rigidbody, </strong>and a lot of other cool stuff that you can use during the game development. And of course you can freely experiment with the code I provide with my <strong>repository</strong>.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to my course on platforming game mechanics in unreal 5.</p><p>In this course, we'll start with the Third Person Template project that is provided by Unreal 5, learn about the individual components of this project, how they work, and how we can build upon them.</p><p>In the Locomotion section, we'll use the new Enhanced Input System to create event-driven input mechanics in the Event Graph, adding extra inputs as needed.&nbsp; If this is your first time using blueprints, don't worry, we'll go over what the different nodes and variable types are.&nbsp; You'll also learn about debugging practices and collecting useful data from test cases.&nbsp; We'll also go over the Animation Blueprint, how State Machines work; how and when the character transitions between different animation states.&nbsp; Plus we'll create visual effects using the new Niagara System and use both the event graph and animations to synchronize the effects with the gameplay.</p><p>In the Jumping section, we'll go over tracking character states and introduce the Geometry system.&nbsp; We'll go over how gravity is implemented in Unreal, physics constants, and how we can use them to affect the character's jump.&nbsp; We'll define our character's capabilities, setting limits to what the character can and can't do.&nbsp; I'll show you how to bind a custom event to the jump apex and use that to alter gravity scale.&nbsp; You'll learn how to write functions which accept input parameters, how colliders work, and how events can be triggered by collisions in your game.&nbsp; All this will help us create jumping mechanics which feel more natural, intuitive, and fun to play.</p><p>In the falling section, we'll use the PlayerStart object to respawn the player, learning about Game Modes and Controllers.&nbsp; We'll implement a variety of mechanics which provide player assistance that are common in games but break the laws of physics; Coyote Time, Jump Buffer, Air Control, and Air Brakes.&nbsp; You'll learn more about different node and variable types in the event graph, and how animations can trigger events.</p><p>In the dashing section, we'll import a new character and animations into Unreal.&nbsp; We'll create a new Animation Blueprint and State Machine for our new character, and blend animations together.&nbsp; Then we'll build an entirely new platforming mechanic for our new character; dashing.&nbsp; We'll give this dash its own animation and special effects, and also learn about diegetic UI.</p><p>I have lots more content planned for this course, and will be adding more sections as they are completed.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Learn to create a multiplayer capture the flag game with Unreal Engine. You will be taught how to script your game like a AAA technical designer from a professional in the games industry. We’ll go through the entire process of making the core game logic with tips along the way that will ensure your project meets professional standards. My objective is to prepare students who want to work in the industry by demonstrating how blueprint scripting should be formatted to pass code review and minimize bugs.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will cover the creation of capture points that can be placed anywhere in the world in any desired quantity. Each capture point will be represented by an in-world UI widget in addition to a heads-up display that will show a team’s capture progress. Capture logic will be created in such a way that grants faster progress for teams with more players on a point. Each captured point will grant its team a specified number of points until a winning score is achieved and a winner declared. Each team’s total points will be represented by progress bars at the top of the screen similar to capture the flag games like Battlefield or Battlefront. The game will then restart to complete the game loop.</p><p><br></p><p>Additionally, this course will cover creating a basic weapon and damage system. Players will be able to shoot projectiles from a weapon that will damage an opponent when hit. When a player’s health is depleted, they will respawn at the team’s respawn point.</p><p><br></p><p>This game will be created in the first person perspective and students will be shown how to manage the associated animation systems involved.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Hello, I’m Single-minded Ryan, a game developer and digital artist.</p><p>In this course, we are going to create a classic 2D Top-Down action game with high-quality game assets.</p><p><br></p><p>First, I want to make the learning process really fun and encouraging, and that’s why I spent a lot of time hand-crafting the assets for this course. And I’m sure that these high-quality assets will make you feel like you are making a real game from the very beginning.</p><p>Then let’s talk about the course. We are going to make a classic 2D top-down action game, where the player must defeat all of the enemies in the game world with a sword. We are going to start by creating the platform with the TileMapLayer node. The TileMapLayer node helps us concentrate on the overall level layout, without thinking about what each individual tile should be. But there is a lot of setup work that needs to be done beforehand, and I’m going to guide you through with detailed explanations.</p><p>Then we will cover the movement and animation control of the player with GDScript.</p><p>After you’ve got a grasp of how GDScript works, we’ll dive into a very powerful concept called the State Machine. It helps us manage the behaviors of the characters as the code grows more and more complicated, and you can’t really make a complicated game without it.</p><p>AI Pathfinding is also an essential idea for top-down games, and I walk you through the Navigation system to create the AI of the enemy.</p><p>The amount of work required to make a game is overwhelming, so it is important to build your own tools to speed up the process. I’m going to show you how to auto-generate using the grid data of the TileMapLayer node and how to randomize the look of the trees for the boundary of the world.</p><p>You really need to pay attention to the details of the game if you want it to shine. I’m going to demonstrate this idea with the interactive grass. Not only will the grass react when the player is passing through, but you can even cut the grass with the sword.</p><p>Many times you’ll need to customize your own material shaders for some visual effect. For this part, I’ll show you how to create the blink and invincible effects using the shader graph.</p><p>Bugs are inevitable when you are making games. After showing you how to solve some common bugs, I’m going to focus on helping you understand how to debug the game with visuals.</p><p>If you are eager to improve your programming skills, this course also has a lot to offer.</p><p>I'll talk about many core ideas of GDScript .</p><p>like how to use annotations and how to communicate between scripts using signals</p><p>There are many more things you’ll learn in this course, like the VFX, the UI system, the collision layers, and more. The point is, I’ll keep working on this course to add more content, and I really hope I can help you start your game development journey.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>At the end of this course, you will be able to do things like:</strong></p><p>Learn to make a good-looking 2D Top-Down action game with Godot</p><p>Learn how to code a 2D Top-Down game in GDScript</p><p>Learn how to control the player's 2D Top-Down movement</p><p>Learn how to use the AutoTile system with the TileMapLayer node</p><p>Learn how to create Collison Shapes with the TileMapLayer node</p><p>Learn how to design a 2D Top-Down game level by painting the tiles</p><p>Learn how to control 2D animations with the AnimatedSprite2D node</p><p>Learn how to use the Y-Sort feature for the 2D Top-Down game</p><p>Learn how to use the State Machine to manage the behavior of the characters</p><p>Learn how to create the attack &amp; health system</p><p>Learn how to use @Tool to run code in the editor to randomize the look of the trees</p><p>Learn how to use the TileMapLayer to generate grass nodes</p><p>Learn how to create Interactive Grass (can by cut be the player, and sways when the player passes)</p><p>Learn how to use the Navigation System for the Enemy AI</p><p>Learn how to control 2D VFX</p><p>Learn how to handle the 2D physics layers and physics detection</p><p>Learn how create shaders for the blink effect and invincible effect</p><p>Learn how to use Godot's input system</p><p>Learn how to create game UI in Godot to create the health bar UI &amp; the restart button</p><p>Learn how to use some GDScript unique features like the annotations, the setter and the signal system</p><p>Learn how to use the Autoload system to create the game manager</p><p>Learn how to export the game project into executable files</p><p>Learn how to use the Godot 2D physics engine</p><p>Learn how to debug the game with visual elements</p><p>Learn how to instantiate new nodes in the game scene</p><p>*This course <strong>does not</strong> contain any sound and music assets at the moment.</p><p>*All of the assets (the tile map, animation files, VFX files, background files, etc.) provided in this course are <strong>only for educational purposes</strong>, please do not use them in any commercial projects.</p>",

But beware, this is no ordinary egg hunt.</p><p><br></p><p>Your Characters will undergo a unique transformation. They’ll <strong>Lose Color</strong> when they’re not holding the egg. But as soon as they snatch that egg, they’ll <strong>Fill with vibrant color</strong>, making them the center of attention. And here’s the twist—if you’re the first to be completely empty, you lose!</p><p><br></p><p>We’ll start by setting up a <strong>Rock-Solid Foundation</strong> for our Character Controller. </p><p>Then, you’ll learn how to implement an <strong>IP Scanner</strong> to make connecting with your friends a breeze. No more complicated setups—just straight-up multiplayer fun!</p><p><br></p><p>Once everything is set up, it’s time to Jump into the action!</p><p><br></p><p>We’ll cover aspects of <strong>Game Dev &amp; Unity Netcode </strong>to ensure your game is not only fun to play but also looks great and runs smoothly. </p><p>From coding <strong>responsive controls</strong> to <strong>custom physics </strong>that make the jump pads feel just right, you’ll gain a comprehensive understanding of Unity’s powerful tools.</p><p><br></p><p>I’ll show you how to <strong>architect </strong>your game for <strong>Local Multiplayer</strong>, ensuring that everyone has a blast. I’ll even throw in some Tips &amp; Tricks to make sure your development process is as smooth as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>And of course, I’ll top it off with some <strong>Final Polish</strong>—adding sound effects, haptics, and vibrant particles to make every jump, grab, and victory feel amazing! (Coming Soon)</p><p><br></p><p>There’s even more to the course, so make sure to check out the Curriculum. I’ve kept a few surprises to keep you on your toes!</p><p><br></p><p>Are you ready to level up your game development skills and create an <strong>Egg-cellent</strong> Multiplayer Game? Join me on this thrilling journey, Enroll now!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Extra Packages!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>P.S.

  "description": "<p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;Many games are based on levels, and most of those games have a screen where:&nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>The user can choose a level to play.</p></li><li><p>Some levels are locked until previous levels have been played.</p></li><li><p>A number of stars are shown based on the player’s score for that level.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the most commonly asked game dev questions is, “How do I lock and unlock levels?” Until now I’ve tried to explain the concept to people but now I have a better answer…&nbsp; </p><p>The Outlaw Game Tools Level Manager</p><p>OGT Level Manager is a library you include in your game and then “tweak” some variables to specify which graphics you want to use, how many total levels you have, etc.</p><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;And then in your game it’s as easy as this to unlock the next level when the player has finished with the current level:&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; unlockNextLevel()&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;OGT Level Manager keeps track of which levels have been unlocked and it’s shown automatically when the player goes back to the level select screen!&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;If you’re using a “stars” system in your game, OGT Level Manager will even keep track of how many stars were earned on each level. And it’s this easy to use:&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; updateStars(2)&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;That one call will let OGT Level Manager know the player earned two stars on that level and <em>it will automatically</em> show the correct number on the level select screen.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;Here are some of the features found in this library:&nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>No limit to the number of levels.</p></li><li><p>Multiple pages with next and previous arrows.</p></li><li><p>One to three stars shown on levels (optional).</p></li><li><p><strong>Use your own graphics.</strong> Using smileys instead of stars?

Works that way.</p></li><li><p>One Composer scene for each level? Works that way, too!</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;Basically, I’ve made it easy to drop in your own graphics, and then tweak the position of any that may need it by setting variables. <em>Changing the actual code is not necessary</em>.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t <strong>Requirements:</strong>&nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>Solar2D.</p></li><li><p>Use Composer for scene management in your game (built-in to Solar2D).</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;OGT Level Manager comes with two sets of tutorial videos.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;The first set is for those people who want to just use the library in their games and don’t really care about the stuff under the hood. These are the “basic how to use it” videos.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;The second set dives in behind the scenes and shows you how things work. Just a word of warning, for this second set of videos I’m assuming you have at least an intermediate knowledge of using Solar2D. I don’t start clear back at the “this is how you display a graphic” point.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; \t <strong>You will save a LOT of time by using OGT Level Manager </strong>-- time you can spend working on the more fun parts of your new game!&nbsp; </p>",

  "description": "<p>Hi welcome to this C# Programming language course. MOO ICT is an online programming tutor on the web and YouTube. We make a lot of fun tutorials ranging from games, web and apps while using the latest trends of programming and making learning more accessible for more people on the web.</p><p>In this course we will make a customizable flappy bird game using Windows Form, .NET 6 and Visual Studio IDE. We will be making this game from scratch import the images, lay out the GUI, create multiple forms, code the forms, add sound and finally publish the game to a self-contained set up wizard that will install the game into a chosen folder, create a shortcut to desktop and start menu. Also, we will explore a portable way to publish the app without the set-up wizard.</p><p>We will not be using any games engine for this course. We wanted to demonstrate the possibilities with windows form application, and we believe it’s still a good platform to create quick prototypes of apps and games. Windows form is an older framework, but we will be using the .NET 6 version of the windows form that’s suitable for the purpose of this game. The tutorial we did on YouTube for flappy bird was originally created on the .net framework and this version has been updated and added few awesome features to the game to make it more fun and full of neat features.</p><p>The feature of this game includes:</p><ol><li><p>Click on the bird/pipe image on the title screen, it will cycle through different bird images that’s being loaded from different folders in the background.</p></li><li><p>Cycle through animations for the birds, this includes the image for facing up and facing down</p></li><li><p>Remember the player choices from the title screen and change the bird and pipe image on the games form.</p></li><li><p>Playing jumping and hit sound in the game</p></li><li><p>Save high score locally, so when the game is closed it will remember that the high score in the game was.</p></li><li><p>Read the high score in the title screen and the game screen. Both screens will be read the up-to-date high score from the file.</p></li><li><p>When the game ends press the R key on the keyboard to restart the game. This feature is added so you wont have to go back to the start window and reset the game from there, you can simply press R and play again directly from the games window.</p></li><li><p>Use double pipes with a space in the middle. Pipes will have their own function which will change their location in the game randomly while keeping a gap in the middle of them. This way the game will be more challenging for the player and give them an unpredictable play through.</p></li></ol>",

  "description": "<p><strong>The Ultimate Tower Defense Formula</strong> is your complete guide to creating a fully functional, polished 2D tower defense game using Unity and C#. </p><p>Have you ever wanted to build your own 2D game in Unity but didn’t know where to start, or felt overwhelmed by all the moving parts? You’re not alone. A lot of beginners jump into Unity, create a quick prototype, and then get stuck when it comes to actually finishing and polishing a full game. That’s exactly what this course is designed to solve.</p><p>In this hands-on class, you and I will build a complete <strong>2D tower defense game</strong> step by step, from a blank Unity project all the way to a finished, polished game that you can share with your friends, or even publish online for the world to play. Along the way, you’ll learn <strong>real-world skills</strong> like creating towers and enemies, spawning waves, balancing difficulty, and designing modular systems with <strong>ScriptableObjects</strong> and <strong>object pooling</strong>.</p><p>Once the gameplay is working, we’ll move into the fun part: making your project look and feel like a real game. You’ll add a <strong>custom UI, animations, art, and particle effects</strong> that bring your tower defense game to life.</p><p>This <strong>Beginner Unity course</strong> is the perfect starting point for anyone looking to master <strong>Unity 2D game development</strong>.

  "description": "<p>***SOURCE PROJECT FILES UPDATED FOR SWIFT 3 (see change notes below)</p>\n\n<p>In the first section of videos, you'll learn how to find connected controllers, define which buttons do what, set player indexes (i.e. Player 1, Player 2, etc) and work with a basic character.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In section 2,  you'll learn the Swift  / Sprite Kit code to work with multiple Extended / Standard Gamepad controllers (as well as the Micro Gamepad controller), to go head to head versus players in the same room. After we look at the finer points of connecting and disconnecting controllers and getting each in the right player slot, we'll discuss how to control who is who in any type game, and even go into a one-player mode where the CPU takes control of the second player. This way your two-player game can also be enjoyed by single players. We'll also discuss adding a Pause menu to your game, where players can go back to a Main menu or keep on playing.<span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we've covered all our bases in terms of controlling each player and dealing with controllers disconnecting and reconnecting, section 3 allows us to have some fun. This session we'll loosen things up a bit and just talk game play. Topics include collision detection, decrementing health, losing lives / restarting rounds, and other topics worthy of a good two-player game!<br></p>\n\n<p>***CHANGE NOTES FROM SWIFT 2 to 3</p>\n\n<p>We've included updated source files for Swift 3. If you choose to follow along, line-by-line with the video code, you should have no problems, as Xcode 8 will auto-suggest the correct code for Swift 3.</p>\n\n<p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the Flappy Bird Hunting game master class. This course has been meticulously planned to challenge your views on the capabilities of windows form. What if we can make an interactive, fast paced, multi object shooting game in windows form with C# and nothing else? What if this game would spawn and respawn objects, allow the user to have crosshair on their mouse cursor, play music and register the hits on the birds and reward the players accordingly? Does this game sound impossible in windows form? Yep it kind of does, until you realise that someone as stubborn as you and me will have to find a way to do just that. Why? Well, why not.</p><p>Windows form is an amazing platform for learning programming. Its very basic what you see if what you get platform and most of the times we learn by making calculators, image viewers or other desktop style applications. Windows form is not made for games development but its an interesting challenge to be able to mimic or build similar games as the ones existed before in this limited platform only using the tools available inside of visual studio and not using any of the big game’s engines such as GODOT, Unity or Unreal.</p><p>I want to explore the hidden or less used features of windows form that can potentially be used to make actual games on the platform and for us to learn how to use C# programming in a more productive and effective way.</p><p>Although this is a games development course at the heart of it it’s a programming course. We will complete the course together by making a flappy bird hunting game that’s full of Challenges.</p><p>Features</p><ol><li><p>Make a flappy bird hunting game using native C#, Windows Form, .Net and Visual Studio</p></li><li><p>Import sprite images to animate the bird, MOO, and coin in the game</p></li><li><p>Have a cross-hair to follow the player mouse cursor</p></li><li><p>Add the Media Player dependency for .Net through visual studio to play multiple Mp3 files together in the game</p></li><li><p>Allow players to mute or play the music and sound effects in the game</p></li><li><p>Load external sound effects to the game such as bullet sound and background music</p></li><li><p>Load external background images for the game and allow the user to pick a new background for their game play</p></li><li><p>Load lots of different birds in the game, this will be the bird sprites and we can animate each of them using separate sprite images from external folder</p></li><li><p>Create a BIRD CLASS and import that to the games window</p></li><li><p>Use the BIRD object in the game loop to check if they bird is dead or alive. If alive it will continue to fly within the bounds of the game and if DEAD it will spawn the coin animation and remove the current bird from the game.</p></li><li><p>Add a cow (MOO) that will be collecting the coins when it drops to the ground.</p></li><li><p>Play sound effects for MOO and the coin collection</p></li><li><p>Using different layers of elements to show the background, foreground, bird, MOO and cursor images in the game</p></li><li><p>Load and apply custom fonts to the game directly inside of Windows Form</p></li><li><p>Keep track of the score in the game and save the high score into a text file so it can be loaded and saved in permanent memory</p></li><li><p>Create a fun count down timer in the game and allow the users to hunt as many birds as they can within that time</p></li><li><p>Reward player with more bullets when they accurately shoot 5 birds in a row.</p></li><li><p>When the game is finished we can build a installation wizard to publish the game, this wizard will create a MSI and EXE file to be shared online or offline.</p></li><li><p>The installation process will be custom built, so it will contain the files we want to contain for the game and also include the icons for the file which will show with the desktop shortcut.</p></li></ol><p>If you are not familiar with my work please check out my YouTube Channel MOOICT or search for MOOICT on google and you can explore the different types of educational content I make on my website and YouTube channel. </p><p>Happy Hunting everyone. </p><p><br></p>",

The game becomes more engaging as players can trade items and send virtual money to eachother.</p><p>All the great games out there are using it, look at Star Wars, or World of Warcraft or MineCraft. That's exactly what you will be making by taking this course.</p><p>We will start by designing the data layer using MySQL and PHP. The database will be able to store and retrieve a huge amount of in-game mail, which is something that Unity cannot do on its own.</p><p>Then we will use Unity to design the mailbox user interface to read incoming mail as well as compose and send mail to other players.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we will integrate all of it inside a real working multiplayer game so that we can have live players walk to the mailbox and access the mail messages.</p><p>***</p><p>This course provides all the necessary assets for you. The only tool we use in this course is Unity 3D, and it's completely free to use. No need to spend extra money.</p><p>This course is easy to follow along since all the steps are shown to you in the video lectures, so you can't possibly miss a step.&nbsp;</p><p>Please join the course now. You've got nothing to lose because if i don't deliver, you'll get a full refund. I'll see you in the course.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries and everyday life. From self-driving cars to personalized recommendations on streaming services, AI is at the heart of innovations that are shaping the future. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a pivotal area within AI that focuses on how agents can learn to make decisions by interacting with their environment. This paradigm is particularly powerful for tasks where the optimal solution is not immediately obvious and must be discovered through trial and error.</p><p>One of the most critical aspects of learning AI and reinforcement learning (RL) is the ability to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications. This course emphasizes a hands-on approach, ensuring that you not only understand the underlying theories but also know how to implement them in real-world scenarios. By working on practical projects, you will develop a deeper comprehension of how AI algorithms can solve complex problems and create intelligent systems.</p><p><strong>Course Structure and Topics</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Dynamic Programming (DP):</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Introduction to DP:</strong> Understand the basic principles and applications of dynamic programming.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Q-learning:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Fundamentals of Q-learning:</strong> Learn the theory behind Q-learning, a model-free RL algorithm.</p></li><li><p><strong>Value Function and Policies:</strong> Understand how agents learn to map states to actions to maximize cumulative reward.</p></li><li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Hands-on projects using TensorFlow and Keras to build and train Q-learning agents.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Deep Q-learning:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Integrating Deep Learning with RL:</strong> Learn how deep neural networks can enhance Q-learning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Handling High-dimensional Spaces:</strong> Techniques to manage complex environments and large state spaces.</p></li><li><p><strong>Practical Projects:</strong> Implement deep Q-learning models to solve more sophisticated problems.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Convolutional Q-learning:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Combining CNNs with Q-learning:</strong> Utilize convolutional neural networks to process spatial and visual data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Advanced Applications:</strong> Implement RL in environments where visual perception is crucial, such as video games and robotics.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Exciting Projects</strong></p><p>To bring these concepts to life, we'll be implementing a series of exciting projects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Maze Solver:</strong> Program an agent to find the shortest path through a maze, applying principles of DP and RL.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mountain Car Problem:</strong> Tackle this classic RL challenge where an agent must drive a car up a steep hill using momentum.</p></li><li><p><strong>Snake Game:</strong> Develop a snake game where the agent learns to maximize its length while avoiding obstacles and navigating the game board efficiently.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Tools and Libraries</strong></p><p>Throughout the course, we'll be using TensorFlow and Keras to build and train our models.

  "description": "<p>Welcome to Building Flappy Bird &amp; Ping Pong Games with Godot Engine course. This is basically an extensive project based course where you will be guided step by step on how to build a dynamic action survival game from scratch using Godot Engine and potentially build a sustainable passive income from selling the game on online Marketplaces. This course will teach you on how to build and design games without having to know extensive programming skill as Godot Engine has a visual scripting feature that allows you to drag and drop objects. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Godot Engine, technologies used behind it, and its main use cases, then continue with a full step by step tutorial on how to install Godot Engine, tutorial to navigate its dashboard, as well as exploring all features available on that platform. Afterward, you will also be shown a couple examples of games created using Godot Engine and going over all potential game ideas to build. To make the learning experience even more complete, this course also comes with a project where you will be guided step by step on how to build an action survival theme game from scratch using Godot Engine. Once the game has been built, we will be conducting testing to make sure that all features have been fully functioning and most essentially the game has a friendly user interface from the player perspectives. In the testing session, there will be three main objectives that need to be tested, those are functional testing, performance testing, and user experience testing. Lastly, at the end of the course you will also learn effective marketing strategies that you can implement to reach more potential audiences to play your game as well as get to know several marketplace to sell your games like Itch IO and Steam.</p><p>First of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question. Why should we learn building games using Godot? Well, the answer might be pretty obvious to some people, this is one of the best platform that you can utilise to build and design game without having very advances programming skills, other than that, there are still many other reasons why, Godot Engine has been well known to offer a comprehensive set of game creation tools, including a visual scripting system, 3D modelling tools, terrain editors, and animation tools. Not only that, Godot also provides social features that allow users to connect, collaborate, and engage with other players and creators. Users can join communities, participate in events, share feedback, and form friendships within the platform's social ecosystem. Last but not least, Godot supports multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, HTML5, and more. It provides a unified development environment that allows developers to create games that can run seamlessly on different operating systems and devices. Hence, when it comes to compatibility testing for the game that you build and design using Godot Engine, most likely it would pass without any issue</p><p>Below are things that you will learn from the course:</p><ul><li><p>Learning basic fundamentals of Godot engine, getting to know technologies behind it, and its use cases</p></li><li><p>Exploring Godot dashboard &amp; features</p></li><li><p>Learning basic GDscript code</p></li><li><p>Building &amp; designing flappy bird clone game</p></li><li><p>Building &amp; designing ping pong game</p></li><li><p>Learning game testing objectives: functional testing, user experience testing, and performance testing</p></li><li><p>Learning effective marketing strategies to promote your game</p></li><li><p>Getting to know marketplaces where game developers can sell their game</p></li></ul><p>Additional Projects</p><p><strong>Build and Design Maze Solver Game Using Rosebud AI:</strong><br>In this project, you’ll learn how to use Rosebud AI to generate and design a maze solver game. Rosebud AI, an AI-powered text-to-game generator, allows you to input text-based descriptions of game mechanics and environments, and it automatically generates the code and assets required to bring your game concept to life, making game development more accessible.</p><p><strong>Creating 3D Game Asset Using Hyper 3D AI:</strong><br>Here, you'll explore how to use Hyper 3D AI to create detailed 3D game assets. With this AI tool, you can input specific requirements for 3D models, such as textures, shapes, and styles, and the AI will generate the assets quickly, enabling efficient game development and reducing the need for complex manual modeling.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Have you ever dreamed of creating your own <strong>game engine</strong> — not just using Unity or Unreal, but actually <em>building one yourself</em>?<br>This course takes you on a complete journey from a blank C++ project to a fully functional <strong>3D game engine</strong> capable of rendering real-time graphics, handling physics, audio, animation, and UI — all designed and coded from scratch.</p><p>You’ll start by building the foundation: creating windows, initializing OpenGL, and rendering your first triangles. Then, step by step, you’ll evolve your framework into a full-fledged engine — complete with <strong>scene management</strong>, <strong>materials and shaders</strong>, <strong>component systems</strong>, and <strong>object hierarchies</strong>.</p><p>As the course progresses, you’ll implement real gameplay features such as <strong>lighting, textures, camera control, physics simulation, audio playback, UI buttons, menus</strong>, and even <strong>3D model animation</strong> using the glTF format. By the end, you’ll have a working engine that supports both 2D and 3D rendering, interactive gameplay logic, and data-driven content loading from JSON files.</p><p>This is not a “toy” example — it’s a <strong>professional, modern C++ architecture</strong>, inspired by the structure of Unity and Unreal, but simplified and built from the ground up for learning and full understanding.</p><p>Whether you’re a <strong>game developer</strong>, <strong>graphics programmer</strong>, or <strong>engine enthusiast</strong>, this course will teach you how game engines really work — under the hood.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course focuses on providing the necessary knowledge and tools to develop mobile games using the Unity game engine and the C# (c-sharp)&nbsp;programming language.</p><p>The ultimate and primary goal of the course is to explore the vast majority of functionalities commonly found in mobile games and provide students with a greater understanding of how they operate behind the scenes as well as how to implement them in their own games.</p><p>The course has been developed in December 2022 and aims to provide the most updated and latest features of Unity. <br>In addition, the contents of the course will be updated weekly to ensure top quality to students.</p><p>Lectures cover material in detail and easy-to-understand examples to ensure that all students are able to keep up with the pace of the course and fully comprehend its content. Furthermore, additional resources are provided for each lecture that students can use to review new concepts explored as well as do their own research for a more thorough understanding. Resources provided are in most cases linked to the official documentation of either Unity or C#, or alternatively to trusted and reviewed external resources.</p><p>In any case, instructors are active daily and answer questions raised by students within a few hours.</p><p>To allow students to fully capture the potential of mobile devices, the course will be going into detail about how to capture different types of user inputs and showing examples of how to fully utilize them in games. </p><p>The user inputs covered in this course have been inspired by the most popular mobile games and these include the following:<br>Touches, Swipes, Double taps, Accelerometer inputs (Mainly used for screen shakes), and Gyroscope inputs (Orientation of device in space).</p><p>In addition, the course will cover how to implement ways to monetize mobile games and gain revenue through Ads and In-App purchases.</p><p>The course focuses on the programming side of game development, exploring different API calls available for us to use, and different types of data structures as well as providing general guidelines to improve the coding experience of students. Each aspect will be discussed and explained to enable students of all backgrounds to keep up with the course. </p><p>All of the above will be taught within 3 different projects which will serve as a vehicle for teaching the course.</p><p>Two of the projects will be mobile games inspired by popular mobile games, and the last project will be a bonus project covering techniques that weren't applicable in the two games.</p><p>The first game will be a runner game, which is one of the most influential genres for mobile gaming and it only seemed appropriate to include a runner game within our course.</p><p>The second game will be a tower defense game, which is a genre that has been booming in the past few years in the mobile game development industry, with the genre getting increasingly more popular as the years go by for mobile games.</p><p>These two games will allow us to explore a wide variety of functionalities found in mobile games, in Unity, and in C# whilst developing them. </p><p>Each game developed provides plenty of room for students to apply their own personal preferences and reflect their style within the games, as well as ways to apply the knowledge gained on their own. </p><p>I am a HUGE supporter of learning by doing, so students will be given small assignments which will serve as tiny challenges for students to tackle and practice the knowledge they gained in a real-life scenario. Throughout the development, I provide my opinion on different aspects of game development and how I approach different scenarios to give you a glimpse of how game developers react to different circumstances. The purpose of giving out assignments or challenging you is not to annoy you, but to put the knowledge gained to practice so you are able to get comfortable with the work process of game development, and due to this, none of the assignments are being marked to avoid students getting stressed over them. </p><p>A discord server is in place which attempts to unite game developers together and enable students to meet like-minded people to create game development teams, create friendships, and also ask questions and get support for their development journey.&nbsp; </p><p>Thank you for your time and I hope to see you in the lectures :)</p>",

Then we'll continue exploring Tiled’s Automapping feature, where I’ll show you how to set up custom rules that allow the software to automatically place tiles for you. I’ll walk you through the process of setting up a more complex automapping first, and then we'll also have a look at how to set up automapping for a more simpler tileset. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Importing the level into your Godot 4.3 game.</strong></p><p>Once we’ve perfected your Automapping workflow, I’ll guide you through the process of importing your levels into Godot, ensuring smooth integration between the two tools.<br></p><p><strong>Making the level playable</strong></p><p>We’ll also dive into enhancing your game’s visuals and functionality. I’ll teach you how to set up <strong>parallax scrolling backgrounds</strong> to add depth and immersion to your scenes. You’ll also learn how to animate a character using the <strong>AnimatedSprite2D node</strong>, bringing your player to life with smooth, professional animations.</p><p>Finally, I’ll introduce you to the <strong>class-based state pattern</strong> and show you how to build a <strong>state machine</strong> to control your player’s behavior, from Idle, running and jumping. </p><p>By the end of this course, you’ll not only have automated your level design and integrated your Tiled maps into Godot 4.3, but you’ll also have a solid understanding of key game mechanics and visual effects in order start and create your own polished, professional game.</p><p>Together, we’ll transform your workflow, speed up your development, and give you the tools you need to bring your game worlds to life in <strong>record time</strong>.<br><br><strong>Who is this course for?</strong></p><p>This course is not for complete beginners but is targeted more towards \"beginner+\" and intermediate programmers, so if you have a little, or some experience with the Godot game engine, and are familiar with the C# programming language, this course is perfect for you.

  "description": "<p>In this course we take a look at the various ways we can use photos and other 2D images to create seamless Substance Designer materials. By creating a linked workflow between Photoshop and Substance we'll take advantage of the tools both these programs have to offer to create procedural hand-painted materials.</p>\n\n<p>We start by creating a seamless hand-painted color map from images off the Internet. Once our color map is complete, we use it as a guide for creating all the other maps and masks we'll need for our material.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After finishing the basics in Photoshop, we set up a linked workflow with Substance Designer that will allow us to view our progress in the Substance 3D view, and easily adjust our maps in Photoshop. Here we'll further refine our 2D maps by using some of the nodes available in Substance Designer. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We'll also add procedural qualities to our material. First we'll add some metal veins that can fade in and out and then an animated lava that can be toggled on and off.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course you will be able to learn about the <strong>Game Development</strong> concept in <strong>C++</strong>. We are going to do <strong>Game Development</strong> in<strong> C++</strong> using the most powerful <strong>C++ Graphic Library SDL2. SDL2(Simple Direct Media Layer) </strong>is a very famous and interactive module for <strong>Game development</strong> in <strong>C++</strong>. You are going to cover the very latest concepts of <strong>Game Development</strong> using <strong>SDL2</strong> in this course where we will be covering <strong>5 Games</strong> using <strong>SDL2</strong> each introducing new and interesting concepts for you to learn.</p><p><br></p><p>Each game is going to help you to learn more and more interesting concepts. At the end of this course I assure you that you will be able to create a totally new <strong>Game </strong>of your own requirements and specifications in <strong>SDL2</strong>. This course covers the latest concepts of <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>SDL2</strong>. Moreover if you no knowledge of <strong>C++</strong> or <strong>SDL2 </strong>or any other Programming Language then you don't have to worry about it. We have uploaded a <strong>C++ Crash Course</strong> at the end of this course that will help you gain a good knowledge of C++before you start on with the game development in SDL2.</p><p><br></p><p>Each <strong>Game</strong> that we have made in this course is independent from other games means that you don't have to take the 1st and 2nd Game in order to start the 3rd Game. You can make the <strong>Games</strong> in any order you see fit. We have talked a lot about <strong>SDL2</strong> in this course and what is actually behind the built-in stuff in <strong>SDL2</strong>. If you already know the basic of <strong>C++</strong> then there is no need to take the <strong>crash course</strong> which is in the last section of the course.</p><p><br></p><p>In the course, if you have any type of Questions or if you are having trouble understanding anything then you can directly reach out to me or you can ask your question in the <strong>Q/A section.</strong> I have attached the code with each lecture so that if you got stuck somewhere then you can use the code. There is couple of challenging <strong>assignments</strong> that will test your skills and how much you are learning in the course.</p><p><br></p><p>I wish you a very best of Luck with the Course.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks!</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>As a beginner, I struggled heavily with Roblox GUI. Even though it seems simple to me now, back then I had to learn what EVERY single GUI item does, how to properly script them, how to animate them, do client-to-server communication, etc<br><br>My goal with this course is to fully teach you about how Roblox GUI works. Instead of spending 2 years barely understanding GUI as I have, I will hold your hand throughout this entire process and guide you, step by step, to become an expert on Roblox GUI (and just on the concept of UI in general)<br><br>And don't worry, I won't just barrage you with information out of nowhere. I've consumed many guides in the past which did this, and that's an issue because I never remembered anything they would teach me. The ONLY&nbsp;method that would actually work for me was learning GUI when I actually needed the GUI. And bit by bit, I was able to fully grasp how Roblox GUI works<br><br>I have taken every little bit that I've learned about GUI over the years and stuffed them into this organized course. This course is meant to lead you to an expert level knowledge on GUI, avoiding all the mistakes that have slowed me down. If that sounds like a good offer, I hope to see you inside this course</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the <strong>Unity UI System</strong> course — your guide to creating <strong>ADVANCED and professional interfaces</strong> from scratch for your games.</p><p>This is a complete, real-case-based guide that teaches you how to design and adapt your game UI once and for all across all platforms in a professional way.</p><p>Creating UI can be the most complex part of your project if you don’t understand all elements or how to access them through code. You’ll waste precious time browsing documentation or videos trying to fix every small issue.</p><p>And even if you manage that, adapting your UI to different platforms becomes a nightmare — sometimes forcing you to duplicate projects just to make minor changes.</p><p>This is not a viable path if you want to work in professional game studios or position yourself as a serious game developer.</p><p>UI is not just for the main menu — you’ll use it for gameplay HUDs, inventories, level selectors, and settings screens. If you don’t connect all these properly, your project will become harder and harder to manage, and you'll stop building actual gameplay features.</p><p>That’s why we built this course — to help you master the Unity UI System step by step with real use cases you can implement directly in your own games.</p><p>We teach you how to access every UI element via code, mastering the full class and its features at an advanced level. You’ll have no limits when applying this to your games.</p><p>You'll also learn <strong>all C# interfaces of the Event System</strong>, so you can connect UI elements programmatically for <strong>high-performance</strong> and <strong>smooth gameplay</strong>.</p><p>You’ll build a <strong>full-featured RPG-style inventory system</strong> from scratch, applying everything in a real-world scenario.</p><p>You’ll <strong>master custom fonts</strong> to tailor your game’s look &amp; feel and enhance your project’s visual quality.</p><p>We’ll also build a <strong>complete settings screen with control rebinding</strong>, integrating with the new Input System to give players total control over their experience.</p><p>You can preview the course intro video before enrolling to explore the full curriculum and see how everything you learn will apply directly to your career and your games.</p><p>Your purchase is 100% guaranteed — if you're not satisfied, you can request a full refund within 30 days, no questions asked.</p><p>If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me via private message — I’ll personally help you to make sure your investment pays off in your journey to becoming a professional game developer.</p><p>See you inside the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p>This practical course aims at teaching you step by step how to create a game using <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>Qt</strong>. C++ is a very powerful programming language very suitable for making games, whilst Qt is a very large graphical user interface (GUI) framework fully based on C++. In this course you learn how to practically use C++ to create a GUI application and you also learn how to use and get familiar with the very powerful Qt framework.</p><p>The first aim of the course is to teach you how to plan a game. Essentially, you are going to learn how to turn your game ideas into <strong>Game Requirements</strong> for your Game application. You also learn how to meticulously organise them so as to be able to implement them incrementally, in a logical manner.</p><p>Secondly, you thoroughly learn about the<strong> Qt framework</strong>. Essentially, you learn how to navigate the massive documentation of the Qt framework, in order to be able to get the functionality that you need for your Game. Additionally, you learn step by step how to create a beautiful, coherent, and interactive graphical user interface with the Qt framework.</p><p>Thirdly, you methodically learn how to implement <strong>Game Logic</strong> using C++. Essentially, you finally become able to apply the theory of <strong>C++</strong> in an actual GUI application, in order to create a very entertaining <strong>TicTacToe Game</strong>. Quite simply, you learn how to practically use concepts like selection control structures, repetition control structures, functions, pointers, references, classes, objects, lifetime of objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.</p><p>Fourthly, you learn how to add <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (AI) to a Game Logic. Essentially, in this course, you learn how to create AI opponents that a human player can play against. You first learn how to create a weak AI&nbsp;opponent that a human player can easily defeat. Then you learn, step by step, thoroughly, how a tough AI&nbsp;opponent can be created, how it can be made to be very smart, and therefore very hard to defeat.</p><p>Finally, you get to have a go at the TicTacToe Game by yourself. Essentially, at the end of the course, you get a couple of <strong>Assignments</strong> where your tasks are about ameliorating and extending the Game. This is a means for you to test how much you have understood from the course.</p><p>Regarding the course itself, it is structured in a way that one section builds upon the previous ones. So this is essentially to tell you that not every section adds something new in the user interface or in the game logic. The sections are all interconnected, and in order to create the TicTacToe Game exhibited in the introduction video, you will have to go through the entire course, one video after the other.</p><p>I wish you a pleasant time as you navigate through the course.</p><p><br></p><p>Happy learning,</p><p>Alex</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the Procedural Plant Generation course!</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, we will explore the fascinating world of procedural generation of plants. Plants are complex natural structures that have always been a source of inspiration for artists, architects, and scientists. With the development of procedural generation algorithms, we can now create realistic, fantastic and diverse plant structures in a fraction of the time it would take to manually model them.</p><p><br></p><p>The course is divided into four main parts. </p><p><br></p><p>First, I will quickly introduce this course, my pedagogy, and we will cover the latest scientific research on procedural plant generation, the advantages and drawbacks of procedural generation inside videogames and the project that will structure this course.</p><p><br></p><p>In the second part, we will explain the theoretical approach behind procedural mesh generation. We will see the basic theory to understand how to create procedural plant with coordinate systems, vectors and some mathematics calculations.</p><p><br></p><p>The third part is subdivided respectfully into 3 parts corresponding to theses algorithms: Space Colonization with Animation System, LSystem &amp; Semi-Procedural approach. It's the heart of this course. We will see how to generate for these 3 algorithms a plant global form with Catmull-Rom Spline and also how to animate it smoothly.</p><p><br></p><p>The last part will show how to integrate external assets inside LSystem Plant Generation to create a basic timelapse.</p><p><br></p><p>It is important to note that this course DOES NOT COVER topics such as : </p><ul><li><p>Procedural Terrain Generation</p></li><li><p>Specific Flower / Tree / Plant Species Generation &amp; Animation</p></li><li><p>Procedural Generation of Specific Parts of Flower / Tree / Plant like Leaves / Petals / Buds / Fruits etc.</p></li></ul><p>However, you will understand and learn the essential skills to create meshes looking like plants, from a coding perspective and how to integrate asset resources (3D models &amp; 2D sprites) on it to enhance your creations.</p><p><br></p><p>Lastly, I want to emphasize that all the assets used in the projects are free to be used, as long as the creators are cited and all conditions of their respective license are filled. I really want to encourage the use of free resources and the support of talented creators.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether you are an artist, a (game) developer, or a computer graphics enthusiast, this course will provide you with the knowledge and tools to create your own procedurally generated plants. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of the theory and practice of procedural plant generation, and you will be able to create your own complex plant structures, realistic or on the contrary completely unreal. </p><p><br></p><p>Let's get started!</p>",

Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced coder looking to break into game development, this course is your perfect starting point.</p><p><br></p><p>**Unity** is one of the most powerful and widely-used game engines in the world. It’s used not only to build hit games for mobile, PC, and consoles, but also for architectural visualization, VR/AR, simulations, and even medical applications. The only challenge? Unity can be overwhelming for beginners — but that’s exactly where this course comes in.</p><p><br></p><p>### Why This Course?</p><p><br></p><p>We make learning Unity and C# programming **fun, easy, and practical**. Instead of starting with dry theory, you’ll jump straight into creating real games. This project-based approach keeps you motivated and helps you immediately apply what you learn. By the end of the course, you’ll have built several fully functional games from scratch — and have a deep understanding of Unity, C# scripting, and game development workflows.</p><p><br></p><p>### What You’ll Learn:</p><p><br></p><p>- The Unity interface, tools, and core workflows&nbsp; </p><p>- Fundamentals of C# programming for game development&nbsp; </p><p>- Game physics, collisions, player controls, and interactions&nbsp; </p><p>- 2D and 3D game development essentials&nbsp; </p><p>- Building UI (menus, score systems, buttons, etc.)&nbsp; </p><p>- Creating multiple complete games, step-by-step&nbsp; </p><p>- Exporting your game to multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Android, Web, etc.)&nbsp; </p><p>- Best practices for clean code, game design, and optimization&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>Whether you want to build a personal portfolio, launch your own indie game, or prepare for a career in game development, this course will give you the foundation you need.</p><p><br></p><p>### Why Learn from Us?</p><p><br></p><p>- **Experienced Instructors** – Our instructors are skilled game developers and passionate educators who make complex concepts simple and fun.</p><p>- **Project-Based Learning** – Learn by doing. Build actual games as you go.</p><p>- **Lifetime Access** – Enroll once and get access to all current and future content — forever.</p><p>- **Supportive Community** – Ask questions and get help whenever you need it.</p><p><br></p><p>### Who This Course Is For:</p><p><br></p><p>- Complete beginners who want to learn programming through game development&nbsp; </p><p>- Aspiring game developers looking for a hands-on introduction to Unity and C#&nbsp; </p><p>- Existing coders (especially C# developers) wanting to switch to game dev&nbsp; </p><p>- Hobbyists, students, or anyone excited to create their own video games&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>No prior experience in coding or game design is required — just a computer and a passion for learning.</p><p><br></p><p>---</p><p><br></p><p>**Enroll now and start building your first Unity game today!** With expert guidance, a hands-on approach, and engaging projects, you’ll be amazed at what you can create.</p><p><br></p><p>Let's build something awesome together!</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>We at Mammoth Interactive value input from students like you. Feel free to leave us your feedback. </strong></p><p><strong>Why SpriteKit?</strong></p><p>SpriteKit is the framework for making 2D games for Apple products. It's <strong>​free</strong>​! You can make cool games, from super simple to more complex, in SpriteKit. SpriteKit provides support for cool special effects and physics. It's a ​<strong>fun</strong>​ interface to express your creativity. Before you know it, you could see a game you built in SpriteKit in the App Store!</p><p>To give a game functionality, you add code to your game's objects in Xcode. Xcode is a user-friendly programming language that is easy to understand.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anyone can use SpriteKit.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In this course, you learn how to make simple 2D games using Apple's SpriteKit. You build the following games: Breakout Clone, Pong Clone, and Space Invaders. This course is unique because we make <strong>​both the code and the design</strong> ​for the games from scratch.&nbsp;</p><p>Other tutorials only show you how to make the functionality or design of a game. We at Mammoth Interactive show you how to do both.&nbsp;</p><p>Don't worry if you've never coded before. We ​<strong>start simple</strong>​ and add more to the game as the course goes on. This course begins with an introduction to SpriteKit for those who have never used it before. You will learn how to navigate SpriteKit's interface.</p><p><em>The beauty of taking an online course like this is the ability to replay any of the lectures at any time. There is no time limit or final tests. ​Y</em><strong><em>ou get to learn at your own pace with a practical model method of learning.</em></strong></p><p><em>One of the best features is that you can watch the courses at any speed you want. This means you can speed up or slow down the video if you want to.</em></p><p>This course is ​<strong>project-based​</strong> so you will not be learning a bunch of useless coding practices. At the end of this course you will have real world apps to use in your portfolio.&nbsp;</p><p>We feel that project based training content is the best way to get from A to B. Taking this course means that you learn practical, employable ​<strong>skills immediately</strong>.</p><p>You can use the projects you build in this course to add to your LinkedIn profile. Give your portfolio fuel to take your career to the next level.</p><p>Learning how to code is a great way to jump in a new career or enhance your current career. Coding is the new math and learning how to code will propel you forward for any situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn it today and get a head start for tomorrow. ​<strong><em>People who can master technology will rule the future.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Is this course for me?</strong></p><p>Even if you're not an artist, you can design basic games. You may have heard of Axiom Verge and Stardew Valley. These games are million-dollar successes. But did you know that only one person made each?</p><p>Usually it takes a whole team of people to build a game. But creators Thomas Happ and Eric Barone developed and designed their games by themselves. Now they're millionaires. You can do it, too.</p><p>By taking this course, you will gain the tools you need to continue improving yourself in the field of game development. You will be able to apply what you learned to further experiment in SpriteKit or any other game development framework.</p><p>Also now included in these bundles are our extra courses. If you want to learn to use other programs such as Camtasia or Sketch, you get more content than what you paid for this way!</p><p>We really hope you decide to purchase this course and take your knowledge to the next level. Let's get started.</p><p><strong>Enroll now to join the Mammoth community!</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Please read requirement first, learners need to have basic understanding of C++. </strong></p><p><strong>Or I recommend you take basic level C++ course first. </strong></p><p><br></p><p>UPDATES:</p><p>2024.10.12 : All auto-generated captions are corrected.</p><p><br></p><p>Welcome to \"<strong>Create Zeldar-like skills with C++ in unreal engine 5</strong>\"! You will learn how to create a skill framework which can handle various abilities including remote bomb, magnesis, stasis and ice actor, and basic locomotion states such as sprinting, gliding and exhausted states. I prepared reference projects for every lesson so when you are stuck in any lesson you can freely download them and compare your own project with them! Don't worry about making mistakes, learn from them!</p><p><br></p><p>In the first section, we're going to <strong>setup project and implement basic locomotion states</strong> for player character from scratch in C++. With enhanced input system and locomotion manage, these customized actions will be triggered when player character meets certain conditions. For example, once player character is falling from high place and having enough stamina, gliding action is available. If stamina is depleted, player character cannot jump, sprint or gliding anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, we will design and <strong>create a powerful framework to manage various skills before any skill creation</strong>. Only one skill could be activated at one time. Thanks to the convienient communication between blueprint and c++ in unreal engine, we can easily transfer information from UI to our code base. It is the best way to take advantage of them. Blueprint is more convenient for visual design and c++ is more performant for game in general.</p><p><br></p><p>Thirdly, we're focus on several kinds of different skills including <strong>remote bombs, magnesis, stasis and ice actor spawning</strong>. In remote bomb skill, a bomb will be spawned and player character can throw it out. When it explodes on breakable wall, it will crash and if it explodes on grass, a tempory wind tunnel will be spawned, which might be helpful for player to solve puzzles in the game. Sure I will introduce more details in the course. Though their logics are totally different, they all in the same skill framework so developer can easily add new skill types. </p><p><br></p><p>At last, several useful gameplay object will be implemented for better play experience. Those objects must be compatible with skill framework. For example, <strong>interactable object</strong> such as rock will be added. When player is holding a rock but trying to activate a skill, this rock must be dropped first. Similarly, <strong>pressure plate, wind tunnel, breakable walls</strong> will be implemented.</p><p><br></p><p>You can also join my discord to ask question or in udemy Q&amp;A part. With detailed reference project provided in each lecture and a step-by-step approach, what are you waiting for? Join the course and there's no better time to start your own dream project now! </p>",

  "description": "<p>This. Is. It. Part 3 and The final chapter in our UE5 Sci-Fi VFX Series for Game Production. And we’re going out with a Bang. We’ll be diving into more advanced material work with our Energy Shield and deeper methods for prototyping VFX in our Blueprints and Niagara Systems for our Energy shield.</p><p><br></p><p>First we are going to focus on creating our sci-fi energy shield and hook up our automated Turret VFX.</p><p><br></p><p>The focus will be all about more complex material creation through detailed, animated masks and implementing a modular based structure for faster iteration and alteration in order to strike a balance between art direction and gameplay needs. We will wrap that section up in our blueprints by creating spawn logic from our Player Character. We will work on defining proper collision logic and drive certain material parameters through timelines to animate our shield kicking on and off. And of course we will make sure to hook up all of our VFX for our turrets to properly test our shield against enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>In the final section we will make a really satisfying Pulse Grenade.</p><p><br></p><p>We will reuse assets we created in Part 2 of the course from our Laser Beam and Plasma Blaster VFX. You will still be able to follow along if you missed that part, but you will be missing assets that will be used heavily in this course. You may create your own, however, if you wish to fill in the gaps and apply knowledge you already have. We will have a lot of fun creating ways for our Blueprints to be used to create dynamically changing strike points for our lightning arcs by exposing parameters in our Niagara Systems. We will go through some preliminary tests to make sure our beams are working correctly.</p><p><br></p><p>Then we will add more detail to our lightning arcs in our Niagara systems to give them some more shape and dynamic animation. We will even explore some additional material logic in our bonus section by creating a function to make sure our beams stay consistent in their emissive values from various distances.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of Part 3 you will not only have some really cool portfolio pieces, but a better understanding of how to create and prototype many other VFX by leveraging the power of Unreal Materials, Blueprints and Niagara Systems.</p><p><br></p><p>So, hop on in and lets get crafting!</p><p><br></p>",

This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build engaging chess and tic tac toe games using Pygame. This course is a perfect combination between Python and game development, making it an ideal opportunity for you to exercise your programming skills by building interactive game projects. Throughout this course, you'll learn essential skills needed by a game developer, laying a solid groundwork for your future projects. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Pygame, such as getting to know its use cases, main features, and some game project ideas that can be built using Pygame. Then, in the next section, you will learn about the rules of chess and tic tac toe game and most importantly understand how to implement the logic into the code. Before starting the projects, we will also learn how to operate Pygame and get to know some basic concepts, for example, you will learn how to initialize a Pygame window, you will learn how to set the size of the Pygame window, and you will also learn how to change background color. After learning those basic concepts, we will start the project section. In the first project, we will build an interactive chess game using Pygame. In this section, you will learn how to create a graphical user interface for the chess game, incorporating features like piece movement and piece elimination. Additionally, you'll delve into implementing game logic to enforce rules such as check, checkmate, and stalemate, culminating in a fully functional and interactive chess experience. After completing the first project, we will move on to the second project where you will build an engaging tic tac toe game using Pygame. In this section, you will learn how to develop the game logic for Tic Tac Toe, including checking for win conditions and managing the game state. Additionally, you'll explore methods for handling player input, designing intuitive user interfaces, and refining the game mechanics to ensure a seamless and enjoyable Tic Tac Toe experience. After building a chess and tic tac toe game, we will be conducting testing to make sure that the game has been fully functioning and the game is easy to use. We will be mainly focusing on four testing objectives, those are functionality testing, user interface testing, compatibility testing, and performance testing.</p><p>First of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we build a chess and tic tac toe game? Well, here is my answer. These classic games do not only provide entertainment but also serve as excellent educational tools for improving your problem-solving skills and understanding fundamental game mechanics. By creating these game projects from scratch, you will gain valuable insights into programming logic, user interface design, and game development principles, which will set a solid foundation for more complex projects in the future.

  "description": "<p><strong>Master Flame Game Engine with Flutter: Build 2D Mobile Games</strong> is the ultimate hands-on course for Flutter developers who want to step into the world of game development. Whether you’ve built apps before or are completely new to game programming, this course will guide you step by step in building fun and interactive 2D games using the Flame game engine.</p><p>We’ll start with an introduction to Flame and explore the essential building blocks like text, shapes, movement, timers, tap events, and collision detection. From there, you’ll put your skills into practice by creating <strong>Ramp Hit Game</strong>, a brick-breaker style game with collisions, reflections, obstacles, and sound effects.</p><p>Next, you’ll learn how to work with sprites, sprite sheets, animations, and parallax backgrounds, and then dive into an action-packed <strong>Space Shooter Game</strong> complete with enemies, shooting mechanics, explosions, scoring, and a camera that follows the player.</p><p>In the advanced sections, we’ll explore <strong>Forge2D</strong>, Flame’s physics engine, where you’ll learn about bodies, gravity, and physics-driven components. You’ll then apply these concepts by building <strong>Color Catch Game</strong>, where balls must be sorted into the correct buckets using physics, collisions, and creative rendering techniques.</p><p>By the end of this course, you won’t just know Flame basics—you’ll have built multiple complete games and gained the confidence to design and develop your own unique 2D games with Flutter and Flame.</p>",

By the end of this course you will have a template you can begin any of your future tvOS apps with.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Create a Side Scroller Game for tvOS or iOS - Session 1</strong><br></p>\n\n<p>In this series you will learn how to create a retro 2d-style side scroller game from scratch for the new tvOS or for iOS. The project will be initially developed using the tvOS template, then you'll see how to take most of the same code and use it for an iOS app. We'll cover all the essentials to making a side scroller: building a physics-based environment (with platforms, vines, pipes, collectibles), programming a an easy character to move using swipes, adding the HUD (for things like Score or a Lives label), sound and much, much more. Toward the end of this session we'll also discuss how to add a tvOS target to an existing iOS project and share code / assets between the two targets.<br></p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Create a Side Scroller Game for tvOS or iOS - Session 2</strong><br></p>\n\n<p>The epic saga continues in this second session all about how to make a 2D side scroller for tvOS or iOS. We'll look at turning our GameScene into more of a \"game engine\" by incorporating a property list to change variables on a per-level basis. We'll also talk about scoring, moving platforms (that carry the player), \"dead zones\" to kill the player, restarting from continue points, inventory, and much more!<br></p>",
