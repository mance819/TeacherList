This course teaches you what those steps actually <em>do</em> — and <em>why</em> they matter.</p><p>As a Gold-tier Unreal Authorized Instructor, an Unreal Animation Fellow, and a generalist focused on all things Unreal Engine, including Virtual Production, Game Design, and Cinematics, I understand just how fast Unreal Engine is developing and changing. Understanding how the engine ticks (pun intended!) is key to your ability to thrive using Unreal Engine and problem solve when things don't work as expected.</p><p>In this focused, under-2-hour course, you’ll gain an <strong>architectural understanding</strong> of how Unreal Engine 5 spawns and controls characters, including Metahumans, and deep dive into the third person template. Instead of overwhelming you with features, we go deep into <strong>core principles</strong> like:</p><ul><li><p>Inheritance and Composition</p></li><li><p>Game Mode and Default Pawn Class</p></li><li><p>Blueprint Class Hierarchies</p></li><li><p>Live Animation Retargeting</p></li><li><p>Character Movement Components</p></li></ul><p>You’ll learn to bring in a Metahuman and make them playable using the Third Person template — not by blindly replacing meshes, but by understanding the <strong>underlying systems</strong> used by the Third Person template. You are encouraged to break things and find your way back again, asking WHY -- that is the way.&nbsp; </p><p>Whether you're working in indie games, virtual production, or animation, these are the kind of Unreal Engine fundamentals that will <strong>unlock everything else</strong>.</p><p>By the end, you’ll be confident not just in using Metahumans — but in using the Third Person template for your own projects.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the Mobile Game Development Course in which we will <strong>Reverse Engineer</strong>, <strong>Architect</strong>, and <strong>Develop </strong>a mobile version of the famous Chrome Dinosaur Game uing the Flame Game Engine with Flutter and Dart.<br><br><strong><em>Why Develop Mobile Games?</em><br></strong>Mobile Games are by far the largest share of Game Application revenue in the world. More than 50% of all game application development comes from Mobile games.</p><p>Being able to code Mobile Games offers great potential in such a large market.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Why Flame Engine</em></strong></p><p>The Flame Engine is a minimalist 2D game engine that runs on top of the Flutter framework. So it is light-weight with a small footprint.</p><p>This is perfect for mobile games.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Advantages of The Flutter Framework</em></strong></p><p>You work with <strong>one code base</strong> but get <strong>multiple platform deployment</strong>. Basically write once, and deploy to both <strong><em>iOS </em></strong>and <strong><em>Android</em></strong>. This is a huge advantage as it saves you time and effort.</p><p>And this is great for mobile games since we do not rely on the specific OS GUI as we basically take over the screen and create our own GUI from scratch.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Why Take this course?</em></strong></p><p>In this course we will teach you how to go through the full <strong>game development cycle</strong> and you will learn how to <strong>develop a mobile game from scratch.</strong></p><p><br></p><ol><li><p>We will start with the game idea</p></li><li><p>We will then reverse engineer this idea into game requirements</p><ol><li><p>they will include the game elements </p></li><li><p>and the game mechanics</p></li></ol></li><li><p>We will then consider the game aesthetics</p></li><li><p>We will create a game architecture</p></li><li><p>And then we will fully develop the game.</p></li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Assumptions</em></strong></p><p>We assume that you know Flutter/Dart and have worked with it.<br>We also assume that you have some knowledge of the Flame Engine. This could be either through an introductory course such as \"<strong>Flame &amp; Flutter with Dart : Build your First 2D Mobile Game\" </strong>which is offered on Udemy or through some online tutorials.</p><p>Everything in this course will be explained in detail including the code so you do not have to be an expert.</p><p><br><strong><em>What will you learn?</em></strong></p><p>This course will teach you not just to code the game but it will teach you the full scope of the game development cycle.</p><p>The Chrome Dinosaur game is an example of a very popular game genre which is the Endless Runner Game and also known as Infinite Runner Game.</p><p>Developing any game from scratch is a great exercise that will not only make you a better game developer but it will also help you master the Flame Game Engine API so that you will be able to create your own games.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reverse Engineering </strong>a Game is a very important skill for a game developer and we will look carefully at every detail of the game mechanics and the game elements for the Chrome Dino game, and we will map the mechanics and the elements into an architecture which we will then develop.</p><p><br></p><p>We will use efficient sprite animation as well as simple sound design. We will map out all the individual game elements and their mechanics and then we will combine them into more complex behavior. For example we will combine the mechanics of our Dino and the obstacles to include Collision Detection in the most efficient and architecturally sound manner.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Milestone approach</em></strong></p><p>Part of how we teach you in this course revolves around practical case studies. Each case study shows you a full solution to a given element of 2D game coding such as for example Animation or Collision Detection.</p><p><br></p><p>Each milestone will build on the previous one which is one of the most important skills in software development. We will build for ease of modification and ease of enhancement.</p>",

    "In terms of computer skills, all knowledge introduced in this course will assume no prior programming experience from you. So for now, you only need to be able to perform common computer tasks, such as downloading items, opening and saving files, be comfortable with dragging and dropping items and typing, and relatively comfortable with Unity’s interface. This being said, because the focus of this course is on scripting, and while all steps are explained step-by-step, you may need to be relatively comfortable with Unity’s interface, as well as creating and transforming objects.",
    "So, if you would prefer to become more comfortable with Unity prior to start scripting, you can take the first course in the series called Unity From Zero to Proficiency (Foundations).

  "description": "<p>This project is the world's biggest <strong>on-demand tutorial series</strong> designed to teach ANYONE how to code and build impressive games with the Unreal Engine.</p><p><strong>Benefits of Learning Unreal</strong></p><p>Popular - Unreal is a free game development engine used by developers all the way from beginner indie developers to AAA studios. The community is large and available for help.</p><p>Powerful - Unreal is a powerful engine, with a huge library of image assets available for you to use as much as humanly possible, saving hours of development time.</p><p>High Definition - Unreal is one of the main engines to use because it is so good at making good looking and high quality games. Unreal has high fidelity, meaning you can zoom in and still have high quality images.</p><p>Coding Optional - The best part about Unreal is their blueprint system, letting you build games without coding. We have been using Unreal technologies since UDK and are delighted to see that the blueprint system is incredibly robust and resource-efficient.</p><p>Resource-Efficient - You can minimize loss of performance by a large amount simply by using Blueprints.</p><p>Other Industries - Unreal is for more than just game development. You can get hired in filmmaking, architectural design and product visualization, to name a few.</p><p>For instance, Mcclaren Automotive uses Unreal to let users visualize their own unique luxury car before building it. Unreal Engine has even been used to build Star Wars-themed areas in Disney World and Disneyland.</p><p>The Weather Channel used mixed reality to visualize Hurricane Florence's floods.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This is a course of advanced vehicle mechanics using Unreal Engine and Blueprint. The course begins with drivable vehicle mechanics. And we will also implement engine sound system and action camera mechanics in this section.</p><p>In the next section we will implement racing functionality. We will make a AI racing car which will be potent enough to beat the player car. In this section we will also make use of line trace and build collision avoidance system. In this section our focus will be to make a racing car which will maximize the speed taking care of safety.</p><p>Next we will use unreal's navigation system and will implement some Chasing Mechanics. Where we will develop a police car which will chase the player. Also when the player car is out of their sight they will roam around at some random location in search of the player car. </p><p>This course requires some experience with Unreal Engine. If you have previously created any project using unreal then you are good to follow along with this course.</p><p>This course can boost your ability to program with blueprint. You will learn a lots of techniques here. Starting from Input key mapping up to advanced racing and chasing mechanics. There is no such course available on the internet with this topic till now. And I am really glad to share these knowledges with you.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Updated for Unreal Engine 5.4!</strong></p><p>Learn Unreal Engine 5 from scratch by making three different prototype games.</p><p>This fast-paced course will take you from complete beginner to novice in a fun interactive way! All content within this course has been adapted from my teaching content taught in award-winning academia in England, designed to take anyone who has used a computer to prepare, teach and push them into the world of game development. This fast-paced course will be split into three prototype projects that will teach you the fundamentals and core principles of game design and scripting.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Breakout</em></strong><em>:</em></p><p>Develop a simple prototype similar to the classic retro title! You will learn concepts such <strong>Level Management, Collision, Cameras </strong>and <strong>Simple Game Logic. </strong>All done within the <em>powerful blueprint scripting</em> <em>language</em> packaged for free within Unreal Engine 5!</p><p><strong><em>Slot Car Racer:</em></strong></p><p>Remember playing with slot cars as a child? Maybe you have played a flash version in school? Well, you can make your own! Developing a local multiplayer game that only requires one keyboard! You will learn concepts such as <strong>Splines, Input Management, Events, Functions </strong>and <strong>Game Logic</strong></p><p><strong><em>Rock Paper Scissors:</em></strong></p><p>The ultimate decidor! This project might seem like a simple playground game but in fact, it holds a great lesson within some core gameplay pillars that every developer should know! You will learn concepts such as <strong>Blueprint Communication, RandomLogic, and Win&amp;FailureStates</strong>. We can go even further with this project and turn it into a turn-based battle game! </p><p><br></p><p><em>This course contains recordings from multiple teaching livestreams given. </em><br><br>Plus: <br>New for 2024. Access to new discord community for faster support.<br><strong>Unleash your creativity using Unreal Engine,</strong> known as the \"Best Game Engine\" by many as well as the Develop Industry Excellence Awards and Game Developer Magazine.</p><p>Powerful and revered, Unreal Engine has played a pivotal role in crafting blockbuster games and iconic franchises, from the vibrant realms of Fortnite to the immersive narratives of BioShock and the gripping action of Gears of War. Its influence extends to a myriad of acclaimed titles, including Splinter Cell, Rainbow Six, Borderlands, Dishonored, Mass Effect, Batman: Arkham Asylum, and countless others.</p><p>Gone are the days when Unreal Engine was exclusive to large corporations – now, with the liberating Unreal Engine 5, the game-changer is accessible to all, offering its cutting-edge features for free. Dive into the future of game development, and when your creation soars beyond $1 million in sales, Epic Games merely asks for a 5% share, making your dreams of crafting exceptional games more achievable than ever.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fast-paced to give you the information you need now</strong></p><p>Within 5 hours you will have not just one project, but <strong>3</strong> different unique projects for you to expand upon and make your own! I have spent over a decade using Unreal Engine and have taught the engine in multiple schools and universities across England and Europe! Start off with my 30-minute fundamentals module that takes you through the editor and basic concepts within the&nbsp;Unreal Engine, then learn everything you need to know by... <strong>doing it! </strong>I will be there every step of the way to guide you through this. You may even get some comments from my own experience making blockbuster videos games!</p><p><br></p>",

It starts by exploring how to configure UDK files and software and ends with a working game featuring time-limits, editor integration, component-based actors, and custom Kismet nodes.  </p>  <p>  \t Overall, you’ll see how to build a game from the ground up. Along the way, you’ll explore core UnrealScript features such as console commands for improving debugging, class states for dynamically changing actor behavior, custom Kismet nodes to control program flow visually, the ability to tweak class settings through text-based configuration files, and much more besides.  </p>  <p>  \t By the end of this course, you’ll have coded a feature-filled game in UnrealScript and the UDK. In achieving this, you’ll establish a solid foundation in UnrealScript that you can utilize when building your own games.  </p>  <h4 style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">About the Author</strong></h4>  <p>  \t<span><strong style=\"\">Alan Thorn</strong> is a London-based game developer, freelance programmer, and author with over 13 years of industry experience.

  "description": "<p>In this course we’ll learn how to write correct, safe, and performant code by making use of C++’s type system. Firstly, we’ll learn about the Standard Library’s “algebraic data types” and how they can increase safety, performance, and readability of your application/library. We’ll then look at function interfaces. As an example, writing a function that takes a string in such a way that it performs optimally with both std::string and const char* seems like a daunting task. It gets even more tricky with functions taking other functions as input. Is it possible to generalize these issues and provide the “perfect” interface?</p><p><strong>About the Author :</strong></p><p><strong>Vittorio Romeo</strong> is a Software Engineer at Bloomberg LP. He completed his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at \"Università degli Studi di Messina\".</p>\n\n<p>He began programming at a very young age and is now a C++ enthusiast. While following the evolution of the C++ standard and embracing the newest features, he worked on several open-source projects, including modern general-purpose libraries and free cross-platform games.</p>\n\n<p>Vittorio is an active member of the C++ community: he participated as a speaker at CppCon 2014/2015/2016, ++it Florence 2015 and at his local Linux Day 2013/2014 events, as a Student/Volunteer at C++Now 2015/2016, at Meeting C++ 2015/2016.</p>\n\n<p>He currently maintains a C++-related blog and a YouTube channel featuring well-received modern C++11 and C++14 tutorials.</p>\n\n<p>When he's not writing code, Vittorio enjoys weightlifting and fitness-related activities, competitive/challenging computer gaming and good sci-fi movies/TV-series.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course will teach everything you need to build a complete 2D game in Godot 4! We start from the very basics, downloading Godot 4 and program every single line together until building the game out to a .exe file. Some of the topics we will cover are:</p><ul><li><p>Working with player input</p></li><li><p>Working across multiple scenes</p></li><li><p>Signals and subscribers</p></li><li><p>Creating and customizing the user interface</p></li><li><p>Saving and loading</p></li><li><p>Debugging</p></li><li><p>&amp; more</p></li></ul><p>The goal of this course is to familiarize yourself with the complete game development workflow through Godot. By the end of this course you should have a functional proficiency with GDScript and basic software engineering principals. You will be able to improve upon the game you have built in this course, build your own games, or even take your new skill set to other game engines or software projects entirely.</p><p>This course is ideal for you if you are looking to get into programming or game development. 2D games are a critical introduction to game development, even if you are looking to get into 3D game development. While this course was recorded on Windows, these processes are identical on Linux as well.</p><p>This course is action oriented and focused on the process of creating a classic 2D game from start to finish. While the game allows us to cover a wide range of topics in Godot, we do not cover things such as networked multiplayer, 3D, art and animations, etc. Please review the course content to see if the course would be helpful for you.</p><p>There are several lessons that are available for preview here on Udemy, please check them out ahead of time to see if my teaching style or the content of the course is right for you!</p>",

Pretty much all of <strong>the math lectures and applications use fun animations</strong> that give you a good <strong>VISUAL intuition behind the math</strong>. This is more important than just memorizing formulas like you did in high school. I show you why a math concept is important, the intuition behind it through fun animations, the applications of the concepts in a real game you'll have the source code to, <strong>THEN </strong>you'll use those concepts to make the game even better <strong>by applying your knowledge to make fun 2D graphic effects</strong>.</p><p><strong>In the course you'll learn:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Sine and Cosine</p></li><li><p>Radians</p></li><li><p>Linear Interpolation</p></li><li><p>Vectors</p></li><li><p>Rays</p></li><li><p><strong>How to apply your math knowledge</strong></p></li><li><p>Lots more!</p></li></ul><p>By the end of the course, you'll have a better understanding of <strong>how to apply math</strong> in video games and the <strong>intuition behind core math concepts in games</strong>. You'll even have enough math knowledge to figure out how to <strong>cut an asteroid in half</strong>!</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>There’s no risk!</em></strong></p><p>This course comes with a&nbsp;<strong>full 30 day money-back guarantee</strong>. If you are not completely satisfied with the course, Udemy will refund you what you paid - no questions asked.</p><p><strong>Register for the course today!</strong></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course, Emiel Sleegers will go over on how to make a terrain using both Mudbox and World Machine. First, he will start by creating a base plane in Maya and then sculpting the terrain in Mudbox. From there,we will go ahead and export it into world machine where we will add more detail to the terrain, as well as use Photoshop to generate the texture we plan on using, and once that is complete, we will export and setup our terrain for game engines such as Unity3d, Cryengine3, and Unreal Engine 4.</p><p><strong>(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)</strong></p><p>More about the Instructor:</p><p>Emiel Sleegers is a self-taught 3d artist currently residing in the Netherlands. He's been teaching himself 3D art for the past 3-4 years, and has worked as a freelance artist on numerous unannounced projects. He's a lover of all things 3d and enjoys sharing the knowledge he has obtained with others eager to learn.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Important:</strong> <strong>all software used are FREE to download and use on PC, LINUX and MAC computers</strong> (no need to pay, cheers!)</p><p>In this course you will learn how to use Unity3D to build a professional multiplayer combat system.</p><p>Why would you want to learn how to build a combat system? Because any good online multiplayer game out there uses a combat system where players can fight eachother in player versus player mode and players can also team up together to fight powerful enemies and bosses. This is the core foundation of multiplayer games.&nbsp;</p><p>All the great games out there are using it, look at Star Wars, or World of Warcraft or MineCraft or even Pokemon. That's exactly what you will be making by taking this course. We will start by creating melee combat using shields and sword fighting and then we will go into ranged combat using magic firebolts and bows and arrows. Isn't it exciting already?</p><p>This course can be taken by anyone even if you've got no programming skills. This course is meant for non-artists, meaning you don't have to be an artist to be able to use 3D pixel art graphics since this course provides all the necessary assets for you. The only tool we use in this course is Unity 3D, and it's completely free to use. No need to spend extra money.</p><p>This course is easy to follow along since all the steps are shown to you in the video lectures, so you can't possibly miss a step, and it's a lot more fun that reading documentation</p><p><br></p><p>The skills that are taught in this course are the foundation of any professional video games and they can be applied to all your future projects.&nbsp;</p><p>Join the course now, you've got nothing to lose because if i don't deliver, you'll get a full refund. I'll see you in the videos lectures and in the course forum.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Free Trial:</strong> If you are unsure whether or not to get the course, feel free to try it out! All lectures that are free to try should have a \"Preview\" button next to them. Check it out!</p><p><em>Note: This course was made using Unity 5.2. Any version of Unity 5 is compatible with this course. Also, all scripting is 100% done from scratch.</em></p><p><strong>What is the course about?</strong></p><p>This course is all about learning game development using the Unity3D Game Engine. We will be covering topics that go all the way from installing the engine, to making a character move in world, to creating very simple AI.</p><p>C# experience is recommended, <strong>but not required</strong> as I explain absolutely everything about what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. Although this course is mostly programming, I also take the time to go through the interface, set up basic animations in Mecanim (Unity's animation system), and use most of the commonly used windows within the interface. </p><p>There are always multiple ways to do things in game development. Because I want you to keep an open mind as to the possibilities Unity brings you, when I'm doing something that may feel repetitive, I always go about it a different way. This way you will end up getting more familiar with the engine.</p><p><em>Although this course is the perfect foundation to start as a Unity Developer, all learning levels should benefit from this course one way or another because of the different ways in which I approach situations. That being said, this course is meant for beginner level students.</em><br></p><p><strong>What's included in the course?</strong></p><ul><li><em>30 Lectures, 29 videos and 6 hours of content</em></li><li>All art/sound assets</li><li>The finalized version of the Unity Project we are going to be creating</li></ul><p><strong>How is the course structured?</strong></p><p>This course is divided into 3 sections. </p><p>The first section is all about learning your way through the engine. In this section, I show you where to go to install the engine, go through the commonly used windows in the interface, and talk about terminology Unity Developers use on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>The second section is about creating the player's and all the enemies' behaviors in game. There are a total of 3 enemies (robots, laser fences, and security cameras).</p><p>The third section is about finalizing the environment by adding sounds and a few other things that bring the environment to life. In this section, we'll also be making a build of the application for use by the end user.</p><p><strong>What should you expect by the end of the course?</strong></p><p>By the end of the course, you will be armed with the knowledge necessary to feel confident/comfortable when using the engine for your own projects. Learning new things within the engine should be very easy at this point.</p><p><br></p><p><em>If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me and I'll be happy to reply as soon as possible.</em></p><p><em><br></em></p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em></em>All videos where recorded in 1080p. In order to take advantage of this level of quality, make sure you have 1080p as the selected quality in the video player</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Important:</strong> <strong>all software used are FREE to download and use on PC, LINUX and MAC computers</strong> (no need to pay, cheers!)</p><p>In this course you will learn how to use Unity3D to build a professional multiplayer chat system.</p><p>Why would you want to learn how to build a chat system? Because any good online multiplayer game out there uses a chat system where players can easily interact with eachother by sending text messages and receiving other player's messages back. This is a must-have in any online multiplayer games.&nbsp;</p><p>All the great games out there are using it, look at Star Wars, or World of Warcraft or MineCraft or even Pokemon. That's exactly what you will be making by taking this course.</p><p>The majority of the courses out there will only teach you how to create a chat system on one computer, but this course goes the beyond by have the chat system work on dozens of players texting eachother at the same time.</p><p>You will start learning how to design the chat window user interface, then you will get to program the code logic to send messages to other players. You will also get to program the code to receive messages from other players and create a chat window where you can scroll through the chat log. We will also go beyond and have the player name of the person sending the message, as well as add color coding to easily know who is sending the messages.</p><p>***</p><p>This course provides all the necessary assets for you. The only tool we use in this course is Unity 3D, and it's completely free to use. No need to spend extra money.</p><p>This course is easy to follow along since all the steps are shown to you in the video lectures, so you can't possibly miss a step.&nbsp;</p><p>Please join the course now. You've got nothing to lose because if i don't deliver, you'll get a full refund. I'll see you in the course.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Hello, I’m Single-minded Ryan, a game developer and digital artist.</p><p>In this course, we are going to create a classic 2D Top-Down action game with high-quality game assets.</p><p><br></p><p>First, I want to make the learning process really fun and encouraging, and that’s why I spent a lot of time hand-crafting the assets for this course. And I’m sure that these high-quality assets will make you feel like you are making a real game from the very beginning.</p><p>Then let’s talk about the course. We are going to make a classic 2D top-down action game, where the player must defeat all of the enemies in the game world with a sword. We are going to start by creating the platform with the TileMapLayer node. The TileMapLayer node helps us concentrate on the overall level layout, without thinking about what each individual tile should be. But there is a lot of setup work that needs to be done beforehand, and I’m going to guide you through with detailed explanations.</p><p>Then we will cover the movement and animation control of the player with GDScript.</p><p>After you’ve got a grasp of how GDScript works, we’ll dive into a very powerful concept called the State Machine. It helps us manage the behaviors of the characters as the code grows more and more complicated, and you can’t really make a complicated game without it.</p><p>AI Pathfinding is also an essential idea for top-down games, and I walk you through the Navigation system to create the AI of the enemy.</p><p>The amount of work required to make a game is overwhelming, so it is important to build your own tools to speed up the process. I’m going to show you how to auto-generate using the grid data of the TileMapLayer node and how to randomize the look of the trees for the boundary of the world.</p><p>You really need to pay attention to the details of the game if you want it to shine. I’m going to demonstrate this idea with the interactive grass. Not only will the grass react when the player is passing through, but you can even cut the grass with the sword.</p><p>Many times you’ll need to customize your own material shaders for some visual effect. For this part, I’ll show you how to create the blink and invincible effects using the shader graph.</p><p>Bugs are inevitable when you are making games. After showing you how to solve some common bugs, I’m going to focus on helping you understand how to debug the game with visuals.</p><p>If you are eager to improve your programming skills, this course also has a lot to offer.</p><p>I'll talk about many core ideas of GDScript .</p><p>like how to use annotations and how to communicate between scripts using signals</p><p>There are many more things you’ll learn in this course, like the VFX, the UI system, the collision layers, and more. The point is, I’ll keep working on this course to add more content, and I really hope I can help you start your game development journey.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>At the end of this course, you will be able to do things like:</strong></p><p>Learn to make a good-looking 2D Top-Down action game with Godot</p><p>Learn how to code a 2D Top-Down game in GDScript</p><p>Learn how to control the player's 2D Top-Down movement</p><p>Learn how to use the AutoTile system with the TileMapLayer node</p><p>Learn how to create Collison Shapes with the TileMapLayer node</p><p>Learn how to design a 2D Top-Down game level by painting the tiles</p><p>Learn how to control 2D animations with the AnimatedSprite2D node</p><p>Learn how to use the Y-Sort feature for the 2D Top-Down game</p><p>Learn how to use the State Machine to manage the behavior of the characters</p><p>Learn how to create the attack &amp; health system</p><p>Learn how to use @Tool to run code in the editor to randomize the look of the trees</p><p>Learn how to use the TileMapLayer to generate grass nodes</p><p>Learn how to create Interactive Grass (can by cut be the player, and sways when the player passes)</p><p>Learn how to use the Navigation System for the Enemy AI</p><p>Learn how to control 2D VFX</p><p>Learn how to handle the 2D physics layers and physics detection</p><p>Learn how create shaders for the blink effect and invincible effect</p><p>Learn how to use Godot's input system</p><p>Learn how to create game UI in Godot to create the health bar UI &amp; the restart button</p><p>Learn how to use some GDScript unique features like the annotations, the setter and the signal system</p><p>Learn how to use the Autoload system to create the game manager</p><p>Learn how to export the game project into executable files</p><p>Learn how to use the Godot 2D physics engine</p><p>Learn how to debug the game with visual elements</p><p>Learn how to instantiate new nodes in the game scene</p><p>*This course <strong>does not</strong> contain any sound and music assets at the moment.</p><p>*All of the assets (the tile map, animation files, VFX files, background files, etc.) provided in this course are <strong>only for educational purposes</strong>, please do not use them in any commercial projects.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course teaches the new 2d tools and features of Unity 2017, including the Tilemap and Timeline Editor tools. These features are completely new to Unity and allow developers to <strong>develop 2d games quicker and more effectively</strong>. This course is geared towards beginners but is a great choice for any Unity developer looking to learn how to use Unity’s latest tools and features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Tilemap Tool</strong> allows users to paint sprites onto a grid to facilitate rapid and more precise prototyping and 2d level design. The <strong>Timeline Editor</strong>, powered by cinemachine, allows developers and animators to easily coordinate complex cutscenes by providing one timeline that can visually layout the animations of several game objects at once.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course, we will use these two core features of <strong>Unity 2017</strong> to build a 2d platformer game level. <strong>We will build a splash screen, animated cutscene, playable third person character, artificially intelligent enemies, in-game collectibles, and a 2d level.</strong> By the end of this course you will have hands-on experience implementing all of these game features using Unity’s latest 2d tools.  \n\n</p><p>The<strong> full project</strong> made in this course is attached as a resource to the course. So if you get stuck for any reason, you have both the full project as well as myself that you can reach out to for help! </p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Why Use Perforce with Unreal Engine?</strong></p><p>Perforce provides the tools needed to manage large, complex projects, while Unreal Engine’s integration makes it accessible for game developers. From version control to team collaboration, this combination ensures that game development workflows remain smooth, organized, and scalable. Whether you’re developing a solo project or managing a large team, Perforce ensures that your Unreal Engine projects remain secure and easy to manage across their entire lifecycle.</p><p><strong>Perforce (Helix Core)</strong> is a leading version control system widely used in game development, especially for managing large assets and complex projects. <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>, one of the most popular game development platforms, seamlessly integrates with Perforce, making it easier for teams to collaborate and manage project files efficiently.</p><p>Key Benefits of Using Perforce with Unreal Engine:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Efficient Large File Handling</strong>: Unreal projects often contain large binary files, like textures, models, and audio assets. Perforce is optimized for handling these large files, ensuring fast and reliable storage and access.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asset Locking for Collaboration</strong>: With multiple developers working on the same Unreal Engine project, asset conflicts can be common. Perforce's file locking feature prevents team members from overwriting each other’s work by locking assets when someone is working on them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Comprehensive Version Tracking</strong>: Perforce tracks every change made to project files, including who made the changes and when. This ensures a detailed history, making it easier to revert to previous versions or audit changes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Branching and Merging</strong>: For large projects or teams, branching and merging are essential for testing new features, bug fixing, or working on different parts of the project simultaneously. Perforce’s robust branching and merging capabilities make it ideal for complex Unreal Engine projects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seamless Integration with Unreal Engine</strong>: Unreal Engine natively supports Perforce, allowing for an easy setup. Developers can connect their Unreal projects directly to a Perforce repository, enabling smooth version control without leaving the Unreal Engine environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collaboration Across Teams</strong>: Whether working in a small or large team, Perforce enables efficient collaboration. Multiple team members can work on different aspects of the project simultaneously, all while ensuring the integrity of the project files and avoiding conflicts.</p></li></ol><p>Throughout the course, you'll explore the fundamental concepts of Perforce, including setting up a Perforce server, managing repositories, and dealing with common challenges in game development. You'll also get hands-on experience working with Unreal Engine’s specific version control features <strong>UE5 </strong>and <strong>UE4</strong>, ensuring that your projects are well-organized, secure, and easy to scale as they grow.</p><p>By the end of this course, you'll have a strong understanding of how to use Perforce to effectively manage Unreal Engine projects, collaborate with teams, and ensure smooth development pipelines, making you a more efficient and organized game developer.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Have you ever <strong>dreamed of making your own video game</strong> but felt overwhelmed by where to start? This beginner-friendly Unity course takes you from absolute zero to building a <strong>fully functional 3D adventure game</strong>, step by step, with no prior coding or game development experience needed.</p><p>Instead of bombarding you with abstract concepts, <strong>we’ll learn by doing</strong>, and with each lecture we’ll gently introduce new concepts and understand how they work. Together, we’ll build a coin-collecting adventure game from scratch, expanding it with movement, animation, traps, enemies, UI, sound, and visual effects.</p><p>This course is not about showing you where to click and what to type. <strong>My goal is to show you why we do things the way we do them</strong>, and in the process transform you into a game developer. You’ll learn to think and execute your plans like a professional. By the end of the course, you will have enough tools at your disposal to kickstart any game project you want to work on.</p><p>Game development is a continuous learning process, I’m not promising you that you’re going to know how to make any game, but this course will give you a solid understanding of the basics, and a strong foundation on which to build. After taking this course, learning game dev is going to become a fun adventure of discovery; with small successes and failures that are an integral part of the journey, and that’s the very core of a fun and rewarding game dev career.</p><ul><li><p>Throughout this course, you'll learn how to create a flexible player controller and how to implement some basic movements like jumping. You'll discover how to use the input system in Unity, how to animate 3D characters, control the camera, and how to play sound effects and create various visual effects to enhance the look and feel of your game.</p></li><li><p>At the beginning of the course, you’ll find a couple of lectures dedicated to teaching you the very basics of programming and using Unity, showing you the most important aspects that you need to be aware of. These are short lectures with plenty of visual aids, most of the programming concepts are sprinkled all throughout the course to help you grasp them in a fun and engaging way.</p></li><li><p>We’ll learn how to create and fine-tune some game mechanics like deadly pits, dangerous spike traps that can either be activated by pressure or with a timer, and sharp spinning blades that are up to no good. Learn to make these the proper way, while making the tools within Unity to edit their parameters and allow us to lay them out easily to make our levels.</p></li><li><p>A game is like a big puzzle, we’ll learn to make some solid puzzle pieces. You can take the knowledge that you acquire here to make more levels, more traps, more ways to move and attack, and innovate on your own, coming up with your own game mechanics.</p></li><li><p>Even advanced Unity developers are sometimes confused about how to create menus and organize their prefabs and scenes in Unity to make a complete game. We’re going to discover some clever ways to keep our project extremely well organized and clean, while remaining flexible and expandable.</p></li><li><p>You’ll learn how to write industry-grade C# code, I have some extremely high standard when it comes to coding, because that’s the lifeblood of your game. Messy code leads to unfinished or abandoned projects, and I’ll give you the best practices to follow to keep your code effective, efficient, and easy to maintain. But most of all, I want you to be able to understand what your code is doing when you come back to it a few weeks later, you’ll be surprised how difficult that is to achieve, it requires high levels of cleanliness and readability.</p></li></ul><p>You’re just one click away from unlocking your game dev super-powers! See you inside!</p>",

If you are familiar or more comfortable with a different vector application then following the steps should be easily transferable to that application.  </p>  <p>  \t                            Once you understand the basics of how to build objects, and add details and shading to them, you will be able to create most any game component you require in your games.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">What this course will teach you:</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                            What is a vector and how to use vector shapes to build art for games.  </p>  <p>  \t                                      How to navigate the interface and use the primary tools within the DrawPlusX6 application.  </p>  <p>  \t                            How to view reference photos, and rough in general shapes, to gradually build up a complete object.  </p>  <p>  \t                            How to use existing shapes, to create the necessary shading to add detail and depth to your objects.  </p>  <p>  \t                            How to create several objects, walking through the process from concept/reference to completed, exported image file.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">What this course will not teach you:</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                            This course will not go into details on creating characters or monsters or entire game levels, as it will be focused on individual objects/props.  </p>",

  "description": "<p>You have just created a working prototype for your game but there is still that nagging feeling: <strong>will the game's UI impress your players?</strong></p><p>Maybe you thought applying pretty-looking UI elements would take a long time. So, you compromised and went with the default theme. Perhaps, you know how to change the look of some components but you don't want to commit yourself to skin the whole set for fear of changing it altogether if a new look will be picked in the end.</p><p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS</strong></p><p>In this course, you'll start off by skinning the most commonly used UI elements in Godot Engine such as <strong>Button</strong>, <strong>Label</strong>, <strong>CheckBox</strong>, etc. Then, you'll move on to implementing more and more complex UI examples. To that end, you'll be tackling the following topics:</p><ul><li><p>Taking advantage of <strong>themes </strong>in lieu of individually skinning components since themes will let you instantly change how your UI looks.</p></li><li><p>Creating <em>new </em>UI components that are otherwise not part of the game engine.</p></li><li><p>Although changing the look and feel of simple UI components will be necessary, sometimes, it won't be enough. We'll show you how to put simple components together to build a <strong>composite </strong>UI.</p></li></ul><p><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong></p><p>By the end of this course, you'll feel familiar with creating themes and coming up with creative solutions to introduce missing UI options. Ultimately, swapping and combining themes will give you complete flexibility in attaining the look you would like to have for your game. You can even use the same methods if you are using the engine for building desktop applications. </p><p>Now, get in there and create fabulous themes!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Nowadays, JavaScript can be used to make games, it brings the question of how good it is to use it for such tasks?. </p><p>Yes Indeed! JavaScript is a great language for game development, depending on the type of game you want to create. JavaScript is best for web-based and mobile games. It’s also a great language for beginners to learn because it’s generally easy to understand and has plenty of libraries and modules available. </p><p>JavaScript games can be played in the browser or mobile phone, so, if that’s your goal, it’s an excellent option. Using platforms and tools can help create both 2D and 3D games that can run directly in your browser.&nbsp; Aside from only web-based games, JavaScript has been increasing in popularity in mobile game development. </p><p><br></p><p>Many popular online games were built using JavaScript. Students who want to create JavaScript game coding can start building one taking examples from one of the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Tower Building:&nbsp;</strong> is a great way to get started with JavaScript games. </p></li><li><p><strong>Bejeweled</strong> was created as an in-browser game in the early 2000s. It’s similar to Candy Crush where you have to match three jewels in a row to score points.</p></li><li><p><strong>2048</strong> is an addicting game that allows you to use your arrow keys to move tiles around in a grid. The idea is to merge tiles until they equal 2048. </p></li><li><p><strong>Polycraft </strong>is a 3D game that is playable in your browser. Polycraft is full of adventure, exploration, base-building, gathering, crafting, and even fighting. It’s an excellent example of how you can move past 2D games with Javascript.</p></li><li><p><strong>Words With Friends 2</strong> is a mobile app game that uses React Native, a framework that utilizes JavaScript to create mobile applications. They chose to use React Native for its ability to create a game that can be played on multiple platforms using JavaScript with one code-base.</p></li></ul><p>See, how fun and rewarding it can be using JavaScript for building games, Let us look at some projects we are going to build in this course:</p><p>1. Hill climbing game:&nbsp;Famous android game but its idea of making vehicle move in hills is never old when it comes to web. We uses different concepts such as webpack, and physics module from phaser library to make this game. </p><p>2. Platformer 2D:&nbsp;we will have detail idea about sprites and how to use them in our games. We will create map (environment)&nbsp;and players from scratch. Different levels will be made and triggers/colliders will be added to make player change from one level to another.</p><p>3. Basics of Phaser library:&nbsp;Different programs to load images, follow camera, loading animations will be created.</p><p><br></p><p>I really enjoyed creating this course. Hope you will also have fun learning. See you at the class!</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course teaches you how you can create a 2D endless runner game. The player will be jumping obstacles making sure not to hit any of them. We will see how we can spawn different obstacles dynamically on the scene and even add scores to our game. The obstacles will be coming much faster each time making the game have some difficulty. The game will be based on 2D physics with gravity, double jumps, and collision detection working to make a fun experience. We will include sound effects appropriately and use the animation tool that is built into the cocos creator engine. All the files necessary for the course are included and there are no special requirements to be able to participate in this course. This course goes straight to the point of creating a simple 2D endless runner game but gives a good foundation and understanding of the game development principles of Cocos Creator. At the end of the course, you will have a working 2D endless runner game that can be deployed to your preferred platform of choice. Upon completion, the student should be able to understand how to work with the cocos creator component based development paradigm and should be familiar with the common functions and tools used in the engine.</p>",

  "description": "<p>GODOT 4 is an increasingly popular and, above all, completely free program not only for creating games. Thanks to its unique GDScript language and accessible interface, it is gaining an increasing number of fans.</p><p>In the course, I would like to familiarize you with the basics of using Godot 4 and do it not on the example of dry theories, but on practical short games in which all our attention will be focused on programming and the interface, without unnecessary and time-consuming bells and whistles.</p><p>In the course, you will learn the basics thoroughly, presented in many practical examples, in gradually increasing order of difficulty. Additional modules in the form of prototypes of simple games will allow you to understand when and how given patterns are used.</p><p>Some examples from the course:</p><p> - How to create an Arkanoid game quickly. </p><p>- How to create an endless runner game. </p><p>- Simple top view car game. </p><p>- Some math and drawing in Godot. </p><p>- Tic Tac Toe.</p><p>- Landing on the platform with a spaceship.</p><p>- Simple Quiz.</p><p>Godot version 4 allows you to create games in both 2D and 3D. The special Tiles map system and many other amenities attract especially Indie programmers who create mainly in two dimensions.</p><p>Programming will be taught in GDScript, a language similar to Python and extremely intuitive in its own way. The user-friendliness of the hint system and the encyclopedia of Methods and Classes in GDScript will significantly speed up the learning process. I invite.</p>",

  "description": "<p>The main goal of this course, as its name suggests, is to teach you how to perform movement, rotation and scaling of Unity gameobjects. </p><p>In the <strong>Position </strong>section, we will start with the vector math basics. Each lecture represents a task that you could try to do yourself after I give you some theory and code examples. We’ll cover most if not all the ways you can move an object or calculate its position:</p><ul><li><p>By using transform methods</p></li><li><p>By using Matf and Vector methods</p></li><li><p>By applying velocity to the rigidbody</p></li><li><p>By using animation</p></li></ul><p>We’ll cover vector operations such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot and cross products and normalization, and try them out in real game development tasks you might face.</p><p>Next, we’ll take a look how to use Euler Angles and Quaternions in order to <strong>Rotate</strong> your gameobjects. I’ll show you pros and cons of each approach and, of course, provide you with some challenging tasks to solidify your new knowledge.</p><p>Finally, you will work with the <strong>Scale</strong>. In this rather small section you will learn how to change the object size to achieve your goals such as a sprite flip or modifying the parent object without affecting the children. We'll also take a look on how to scale the 4-th dimension - the time itself. </p><p>In this course, you will also learn <strong>how to get input</strong> from different sources such as keyboard, mouse and touchscreen, take a look at <strong>raycasting, rigidbody, </strong>and a lot of other cool stuff that you can use during the game development. And of course you can freely experiment with the code I provide with my <strong>repository</strong>.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to my course on platforming game mechanics in unreal 5.</p><p>In this course, we'll start with the Third Person Template project that is provided by Unreal 5, learn about the individual components of this project, how they work, and how we can build upon them.</p><p>In the Locomotion section, we'll use the new Enhanced Input System to create event-driven input mechanics in the Event Graph, adding extra inputs as needed.&nbsp; If this is your first time using blueprints, don't worry, we'll go over what the different nodes and variable types are.&nbsp; You'll also learn about debugging practices and collecting useful data from test cases.&nbsp; We'll also go over the Animation Blueprint, how State Machines work; how and when the character transitions between different animation states.&nbsp; Plus we'll create visual effects using the new Niagara System and use both the event graph and animations to synchronize the effects with the gameplay.</p><p>In the Jumping section, we'll go over tracking character states and introduce the Geometry system.&nbsp; We'll go over how gravity is implemented in Unreal, physics constants, and how we can use them to affect the character's jump.&nbsp; We'll define our character's capabilities, setting limits to what the character can and can't do.&nbsp; I'll show you how to bind a custom event to the jump apex and use that to alter gravity scale.&nbsp; You'll learn how to write functions which accept input parameters, how colliders work, and how events can be triggered by collisions in your game.&nbsp; All this will help us create jumping mechanics which feel more natural, intuitive, and fun to play.</p><p>In the falling section, we'll use the PlayerStart object to respawn the player, learning about Game Modes and Controllers.&nbsp; We'll implement a variety of mechanics which provide player assistance that are common in games but break the laws of physics; Coyote Time, Jump Buffer, Air Control, and Air Brakes.&nbsp; You'll learn more about different node and variable types in the event graph, and how animations can trigger events.</p><p>In the dashing section, we'll import a new character and animations into Unreal.&nbsp; We'll create a new Animation Blueprint and State Machine for our new character, and blend animations together.&nbsp; Then we'll build an entirely new platforming mechanic for our new character; dashing.&nbsp; We'll give this dash its own animation and special effects, and also learn about diegetic UI.</p><p>I have lots more content planned for this course, and will be adding more sections as they are completed.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This is part 2 In a 3 part series where you will learn how to take an effect from concept to completion and be ready for gameplay implementation. You will learn my production pipeline that has been used in many of my FX throughout AA and AAA game production.&nbsp;</p><p>In Part 2 you will focus more on weapons FX, how they interact with the world, spawn from player logic and animation montages and go deeper into video game production practices. We will dive into using various projectiles and collision responses through blueprint logic. We will tackle different ways of handling projectiles and focus on troubleshooting methods to help better navigate problems that can arise while in a production environment.</p><p>We will dive deeper into materials, exploring more challenging techniques for creating FX. Including multiple UV Maps on FX meshes, animating our muzzle flashes with only one parameter, creating more Material Functions and exposing dynamic and scalar parameters for deeper animation practices for use in our Niagara Systems.</p><p>We will also tackle simulations in Houdini and EmberGen. You will be shown how to pack and export flipbook textures in a way that will help you stay optimized and performant while still delivering high quality gameplay FX. If you do not have access to any of the external software packages used, all of the final textures and meshes will be provided in the course.</p><p>While I recommend starting with Part 1, should you choose to skip it, you will still receive the project file for use along with this course. There will be several things that carry over from Part 1, but you should still be able to manage without them.</p><p>Part 2 is the most massive section of this series and will provide a feature rich learning experience that should give you a more advanced knowledge of how to pull off AAA quality FX for Game Production, so that you can create that stunning portfolio piece that will be sure to catch a recruiters eye.</p><p>So dive on in and lets get crafting!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Learn to create a multiplayer capture the flag game with Unreal Engine. You will be taught how to script your game like a AAA technical designer from a professional in the games industry. We’ll go through the entire process of making the core game logic with tips along the way that will ensure your project meets professional standards. My objective is to prepare students who want to work in the industry by demonstrating how blueprint scripting should be formatted to pass code review and minimize bugs.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will cover the creation of capture points that can be placed anywhere in the world in any desired quantity. Each capture point will be represented by an in-world UI widget in addition to a heads-up display that will show a team’s capture progress. Capture logic will be created in such a way that grants faster progress for teams with more players on a point. Each captured point will grant its team a specified number of points until a winning score is achieved and a winner declared. Each team’s total points will be represented by progress bars at the top of the screen similar to capture the flag games like Battlefield or Battlefront. The game will then restart to complete the game loop.</p><p><br></p><p>Additionally, this course will cover creating a basic weapon and damage system. Players will be able to shoot projectiles from a weapon that will damage an opponent when hit. When a player’s health is depleted, they will respawn at the team’s respawn point.</p><p><br></p><p>This game will be created in the first person perspective and students will be shown how to manage the associated animation systems involved.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Important:</strong> <strong>all software used are FREE to download and use on PC, LINUX and MAC computers</strong> (no need to pay, cheers!)</p><p>In this course you will learn how to use Unity3D to build a professional multiplayer mail inbox.</p><p>The majority of online multiplayer games use a mail system where players can send and receive emails within the game. The game becomes more engaging as players can trade items and send virtual money to eachother.</p><p>All the great games out there are using it, look at Star Wars, or World of Warcraft or MineCraft. That's exactly what you will be making by taking this course.</p><p>We will start by designing the data layer using MySQL and PHP. The database will be able to store and retrieve a huge amount of in-game mail, which is something that Unity cannot do on its own.</p><p>Then we will use Unity to design the mailbox user interface to read incoming mail as well as compose and send mail to other players.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we will integrate all of it inside a real working multiplayer game so that we can have live players walk to the mailbox and access the mail messages.</p><p>***</p><p>This course provides all the necessary assets for you. The only tool we use in this course is Unity 3D, and it's completely free to use. No need to spend extra money.</p><p>This course is easy to follow along since all the steps are shown to you in the video lectures, so you can't possibly miss a step.&nbsp;</p><p>Please join the course now. You've got nothing to lose because if i don't deliver, you'll get a full refund. I'll see you in the course.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

And it’s this easy to use:&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; updateStars(2)&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;That one call will let OGT Level Manager know the player earned two stars on that level and <em>it will automatically</em> show the correct number on the level select screen.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;Here are some of the features found in this library:&nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>No limit to the number of levels.</p></li><li><p>Multiple pages with next and previous arrows.</p></li><li><p>One to three stars shown on levels (optional).</p></li><li><p><strong>Use your own graphics.</strong> Using smileys instead of stars?

Works that way, too!</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;Basically, I’ve made it easy to drop in your own graphics, and then tweak the position of any that may need it by setting variables. <em>Changing the actual code is not necessary</em>.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t <strong>Requirements:</strong>&nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>Solar2D.</p></li><li><p>Use Composer for scene management in your game (built-in to Solar2D).</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;OGT Level Manager comes with two sets of tutorial videos.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;The first set is for those people who want to just use the library in their games and don’t really care about the stuff under the hood. These are the “basic how to use it” videos.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t&nbsp; &nbsp;The second set dives in behind the scenes and shows you how things work. Just a word of warning, for this second set of videos I’m assuming you have at least an intermediate knowledge of using Solar2D.

  "description": "<p>This course is all about learning to code from scratch, starting with the basics. Scratch, the programming language we'll use, is a lot of fun and can make programming feel like a game.</p><p>Our teaching method is unique and has been used for over 3 years. We learn a variety of computer science topics but make it easy to understand by using characters, animations, analogies, and fun! Our carefully designed based on British Universities curriculum lessons help you quickly master the basics and train your intuition to make sense of what you want to achieve and how to get there.</p><p>The content is designed to be enjoyable! We create animations, cool effects, and clones of popular games like Tetris or Pac-Man. These games are handpicked and perfected with our students to optimise learning computer science topics while having fun along the way. The course is regularly updated with new content, challenges, tips, and tricks that you can use in your games and projects.</p><p>This course is perfect for parents or teachers who want to give their children the best skills and the most fun, kids and beginners who want to learn to code games, or anyone new to programming who doesn't know where to start.</p><p>Please note that this course is intended for adults. <strong>If you're under 18, you may use the course only if a parent or guardian opens the account, handles enrollments, and manages the account usage. </strong>I'm excited to have you join the course and start learning to code!</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Hi welcome to this C# Programming language course. MOO ICT is an online programming tutor on the web and YouTube. We make a lot of fun tutorials ranging from games, web and apps while using the latest trends of programming and making learning more accessible for more people on the web.</p><p>In this course we will make a customizable flappy bird game using Windows Form, .NET 6 and Visual Studio IDE. We will be making this game from scratch import the images, lay out the GUI, create multiple forms, code the forms, add sound and finally publish the game to a self-contained set up wizard that will install the game into a chosen folder, create a shortcut to desktop and start menu. Also, we will explore a portable way to publish the app without the set-up wizard.</p><p>We will not be using any games engine for this course. We wanted to demonstrate the possibilities with windows form application, and we believe it’s still a good platform to create quick prototypes of apps and games. Windows form is an older framework, but we will be using the .NET 6 version of the windows form that’s suitable for the purpose of this game. The tutorial we did on YouTube for flappy bird was originally created on the .net framework and this version has been updated and added few awesome features to the game to make it more fun and full of neat features.</p><p>The feature of this game includes:</p><ol><li><p>Click on the bird/pipe image on the title screen, it will cycle through different bird images that’s being loaded from different folders in the background.</p></li><li><p>Cycle through animations for the birds, this includes the image for facing up and facing down</p></li><li><p>Remember the player choices from the title screen and change the bird and pipe image on the games form.</p></li><li><p>Playing jumping and hit sound in the game</p></li><li><p>Save high score locally, so when the game is closed it will remember that the high score in the game was.</p></li><li><p>Read the high score in the title screen and the game screen. Both screens will be read the up-to-date high score from the file.</p></li><li><p>When the game ends press the R key on the keyboard to restart the game. This feature is added so you wont have to go back to the start window and reset the game from there, you can simply press R and play again directly from the games window.</p></li><li><p>Use double pipes with a space in the middle. Pipes will have their own function which will change their location in the game randomly while keeping a gap in the middle of them. This way the game will be more challenging for the player and give them an unpredictable play through.</p></li></ol>",

  "description": "<p>***SOURCE PROJECT FILES UPDATED FOR SWIFT 3 (see change notes below)</p>\n\n<p>In the first section of videos, you'll learn how to find connected controllers, define which buttons do what, set player indexes (i.e. Player 1, Player 2, etc) and work with a basic character.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In section 2,  you'll learn the Swift  / Sprite Kit code to work with multiple Extended / Standard Gamepad controllers (as well as the Micro Gamepad controller), to go head to head versus players in the same room. After we look at the finer points of connecting and disconnecting controllers and getting each in the right player slot, we'll discuss how to control who is who in any type game, and even go into a one-player mode where the CPU takes control of the second player. This way your two-player game can also be enjoyed by single players. We'll also discuss adding a Pause menu to your game, where players can go back to a Main menu or keep on playing.<span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we've covered all our bases in terms of controlling each player and dealing with controllers disconnecting and reconnecting, section 3 allows us to have some fun. This session we'll loosen things up a bit and just talk game play. Topics include collision detection, decrementing health, losing lives / restarting rounds, and other topics worthy of a good two-player game!<br></p>\n\n<p>***CHANGE NOTES FROM SWIFT 2 to 3</p>\n\n<p>We've included updated source files for Swift 3. If you choose to follow along, line-by-line with the video code, you should have no problems, as Xcode 8 will auto-suggest the correct code for Swift 3.</p>\n\n<p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the Flappy Bird Hunting game master class. This course has been meticulously planned to challenge your views on the capabilities of windows form. What if we can make an interactive, fast paced, multi object shooting game in windows form with C# and nothing else? What if this game would spawn and respawn objects, allow the user to have crosshair on their mouse cursor, play music and register the hits on the birds and reward the players accordingly? Does this game sound impossible in windows form? Yep it kind of does, until you realise that someone as stubborn as you and me will have to find a way to do just that. Why? Well, why not.</p><p>Windows form is an amazing platform for learning programming. Its very basic what you see if what you get platform and most of the times we learn by making calculators, image viewers or other desktop style applications. Windows form is not made for games development but its an interesting challenge to be able to mimic or build similar games as the ones existed before in this limited platform only using the tools available inside of visual studio and not using any of the big game’s engines such as GODOT, Unity or Unreal.</p><p>I want to explore the hidden or less used features of windows form that can potentially be used to make actual games on the platform and for us to learn how to use C# programming in a more productive and effective way.</p><p>Although this is a games development course at the heart of it it’s a programming course. We will complete the course together by making a flappy bird hunting game that’s full of Challenges.</p><p>Features</p><ol><li><p>Make a flappy bird hunting game using native C#, Windows Form, .Net and Visual Studio</p></li><li><p>Import sprite images to animate the bird, MOO, and coin in the game</p></li><li><p>Have a cross-hair to follow the player mouse cursor</p></li><li><p>Add the Media Player dependency for .Net through visual studio to play multiple Mp3 files together in the game</p></li><li><p>Allow players to mute or play the music and sound effects in the game</p></li><li><p>Load external sound effects to the game such as bullet sound and background music</p></li><li><p>Load external background images for the game and allow the user to pick a new background for their game play</p></li><li><p>Load lots of different birds in the game, this will be the bird sprites and we can animate each of them using separate sprite images from external folder</p></li><li><p>Create a BIRD CLASS and import that to the games window</p></li><li><p>Use the BIRD object in the game loop to check if they bird is dead or alive. If alive it will continue to fly within the bounds of the game and if DEAD it will spawn the coin animation and remove the current bird from the game.</p></li><li><p>Add a cow (MOO) that will be collecting the coins when it drops to the ground.</p></li><li><p>Play sound effects for MOO and the coin collection</p></li><li><p>Using different layers of elements to show the background, foreground, bird, MOO and cursor images in the game</p></li><li><p>Load and apply custom fonts to the game directly inside of Windows Form</p></li><li><p>Keep track of the score in the game and save the high score into a text file so it can be loaded and saved in permanent memory</p></li><li><p>Create a fun count down timer in the game and allow the users to hunt as many birds as they can within that time</p></li><li><p>Reward player with more bullets when they accurately shoot 5 birds in a row.</p></li><li><p>When the game is finished we can build a installation wizard to publish the game, this wizard will create a MSI and EXE file to be shared online or offline.</p></li><li><p>The installation process will be custom built, so it will contain the files we want to contain for the game and also include the icons for the file which will show with the desktop shortcut.</p></li></ol><p>If you are not familiar with my work please check out my YouTube Channel MOOICT or search for MOOICT on google and you can explore the different types of educational content I make on my website and YouTube channel. </p><p>Happy Hunting everyone. </p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries and everyday life. From self-driving cars to personalized recommendations on streaming services, AI is at the heart of innovations that are shaping the future. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a pivotal area within AI that focuses on how agents can learn to make decisions by interacting with their environment. This paradigm is particularly powerful for tasks where the optimal solution is not immediately obvious and must be discovered through trial and error.</p><p>One of the most critical aspects of learning AI and reinforcement learning (RL) is the ability to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications. This course emphasizes a hands-on approach, ensuring that you not only understand the underlying theories but also know how to implement them in real-world scenarios. By working on practical projects, you will develop a deeper comprehension of how AI algorithms can solve complex problems and create intelligent systems.</p><p><strong>Course Structure and Topics</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Dynamic Programming (DP):</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Introduction to DP:</strong> Understand the basic principles and applications of dynamic programming.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Q-learning:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Fundamentals of Q-learning:</strong> Learn the theory behind Q-learning, a model-free RL algorithm.</p></li><li><p><strong>Value Function and Policies:</strong> Understand how agents learn to map states to actions to maximize cumulative reward.</p></li><li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Hands-on projects using TensorFlow and Keras to build and train Q-learning agents.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Deep Q-learning:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Integrating Deep Learning with RL:</strong> Learn how deep neural networks can enhance Q-learning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Handling High-dimensional Spaces:</strong> Techniques to manage complex environments and large state spaces.</p></li><li><p><strong>Practical Projects:</strong> Implement deep Q-learning models to solve more sophisticated problems.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Convolutional Q-learning:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Combining CNNs with Q-learning:</strong> Utilize convolutional neural networks to process spatial and visual data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Advanced Applications:</strong> Implement RL in environments where visual perception is crucial, such as video games and robotics.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Exciting Projects</strong></p><p>To bring these concepts to life, we'll be implementing a series of exciting projects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Maze Solver:</strong> Program an agent to find the shortest path through a maze, applying principles of DP and RL.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mountain Car Problem:</strong> Tackle this classic RL challenge where an agent must drive a car up a steep hill using momentum.</p></li><li><p><strong>Snake Game:</strong> Develop a snake game where the agent learns to maximize its length while avoiding obstacles and navigating the game board efficiently.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Tools and Libraries</strong></p><p>Throughout the course, we'll be using TensorFlow and Keras to build and train our models.

  "description": "<p>Welcome to Building Flappy Bird &amp; Ping Pong Games with Godot Engine course. This is basically an extensive project based course where you will be guided step by step on how to build a dynamic action survival game from scratch using Godot Engine and potentially build a sustainable passive income from selling the game on online Marketplaces. This course will teach you on how to build and design games without having to know extensive programming skill as Godot Engine has a visual scripting feature that allows you to drag and drop objects. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Godot Engine, technologies used behind it, and its main use cases, then continue with a full step by step tutorial on how to install Godot Engine, tutorial to navigate its dashboard, as well as exploring all features available on that platform. Afterward, you will also be shown a couple examples of games created using Godot Engine and going over all potential game ideas to build. To make the learning experience even more complete, this course also comes with a project where you will be guided step by step on how to build an action survival theme game from scratch using Godot Engine. Once the game has been built, we will be conducting testing to make sure that all features have been fully functioning and most essentially the game has a friendly user interface from the player perspectives. In the testing session, there will be three main objectives that need to be tested, those are functional testing, performance testing, and user experience testing. Lastly, at the end of the course you will also learn effective marketing strategies that you can implement to reach more potential audiences to play your game as well as get to know several marketplace to sell your games like Itch IO and Steam.</p><p>First of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question. Why should we learn building games using Godot? Well, the answer might be pretty obvious to some people, this is one of the best platform that you can utilise to build and design game without having very advances programming skills, other than that, there are still many other reasons why, Godot Engine has been well known to offer a comprehensive set of game creation tools, including a visual scripting system, 3D modelling tools, terrain editors, and animation tools. Not only that, Godot also provides social features that allow users to connect, collaborate, and engage with other players and creators. Users can join communities, participate in events, share feedback, and form friendships within the platform's social ecosystem. Last but not least, Godot supports multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, HTML5, and more. It provides a unified development environment that allows developers to create games that can run seamlessly on different operating systems and devices. Hence, when it comes to compatibility testing for the game that you build and design using Godot Engine, most likely it would pass without any issue</p><p>Below are things that you will learn from the course:</p><ul><li><p>Learning basic fundamentals of Godot engine, getting to know technologies behind it, and its use cases</p></li><li><p>Exploring Godot dashboard &amp; features</p></li><li><p>Learning basic GDscript code</p></li><li><p>Building &amp; designing flappy bird clone game</p></li><li><p>Building &amp; designing ping pong game</p></li><li><p>Learning game testing objectives: functional testing, user experience testing, and performance testing</p></li><li><p>Learning effective marketing strategies to promote your game</p></li><li><p>Getting to know marketplaces where game developers can sell their game</p></li></ul><p>Additional Projects</p><p><strong>Build and Design Maze Solver Game Using Rosebud AI:</strong><br>In this project, you’ll learn how to use Rosebud AI to generate and design a maze solver game.

  "description": "<p>This course focuses on providing the necessary knowledge and tools to develop mobile games using the Unity game engine and the C# (c-sharp)&nbsp;programming language.</p><p>The ultimate and primary goal of the course is to explore the vast majority of functionalities commonly found in mobile games and provide students with a greater understanding of how they operate behind the scenes as well as how to implement them in their own games.</p><p>The course has been developed in December 2022 and aims to provide the most updated and latest features of Unity. <br>In addition, the contents of the course will be updated weekly to ensure top quality to students.</p><p>Lectures cover material in detail and easy-to-understand examples to ensure that all students are able to keep up with the pace of the course and fully comprehend its content. Furthermore, additional resources are provided for each lecture that students can use to review new concepts explored as well as do their own research for a more thorough understanding. Resources provided are in most cases linked to the official documentation of either Unity or C#, or alternatively to trusted and reviewed external resources.</p><p>In any case, instructors are active daily and answer questions raised by students within a few hours.</p><p>To allow students to fully capture the potential of mobile devices, the course will be going into detail about how to capture different types of user inputs and showing examples of how to fully utilize them in games. </p><p>The user inputs covered in this course have been inspired by the most popular mobile games and these include the following:<br>Touches, Swipes, Double taps, Accelerometer inputs (Mainly used for screen shakes), and Gyroscope inputs (Orientation of device in space).</p><p>In addition, the course will cover how to implement ways to monetize mobile games and gain revenue through Ads and In-App purchases.</p><p>The course focuses on the programming side of game development, exploring different API calls available for us to use, and different types of data structures as well as providing general guidelines to improve the coding experience of students. Each aspect will be discussed and explained to enable students of all backgrounds to keep up with the course. </p><p>All of the above will be taught within 3 different projects which will serve as a vehicle for teaching the course.</p><p>Two of the projects will be mobile games inspired by popular mobile games, and the last project will be a bonus project covering techniques that weren't applicable in the two games.</p><p>The first game will be a runner game, which is one of the most influential genres for mobile gaming and it only seemed appropriate to include a runner game within our course.</p><p>The second game will be a tower defense game, which is a genre that has been booming in the past few years in the mobile game development industry, with the genre getting increasingly more popular as the years go by for mobile games.</p><p>These two games will allow us to explore a wide variety of functionalities found in mobile games, in Unity, and in C# whilst developing them. </p><p>Each game developed provides plenty of room for students to apply their own personal preferences and reflect their style within the games, as well as ways to apply the knowledge gained on their own. </p><p>I am a HUGE supporter of learning by doing, so students will be given small assignments which will serve as tiny challenges for students to tackle and practice the knowledge they gained in a real-life scenario. Throughout the development, I provide my opinion on different aspects of game development and how I approach different scenarios to give you a glimpse of how game developers react to different circumstances. The purpose of giving out assignments or challenging you is not to annoy you, but to put the knowledge gained to practice so you are able to get comfortable with the work process of game development, and due to this, none of the assignments are being marked to avoid students getting stressed over them. </p><p>A discord server is in place which attempts to unite game developers together and enable students to meet like-minded people to create game development teams, create friendships, and also ask questions and get support for their development journey.&nbsp; </p><p>Thank you for your time and I hope to see you in the lectures :)</p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course we take a look at the various ways we can use photos and other 2D images to create seamless Substance Designer materials. By creating a linked workflow between Photoshop and Substance we'll take advantage of the tools both these programs have to offer to create procedural hand-painted materials.</p>\n\n<p>We start by creating a seamless hand-painted color map from images off the Internet. Once our color map is complete, we use it as a guide for creating all the other maps and masks we'll need for our material.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After finishing the basics in Photoshop, we set up a linked workflow with Substance Designer that will allow us to view our progress in the Substance 3D view, and easily adjust our maps in Photoshop. Here we'll further refine our 2D maps by using some of the nodes available in Substance Designer. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We'll also add procedural qualities to our material. First we'll add some metal veins that can fade in and out and then an animated lava that can be toggled on and off.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course you will be able to learn about the <strong>Game Development</strong> concept in <strong>C++</strong>. We are going to do <strong>Game Development</strong> in<strong> C++</strong> using the most powerful <strong>C++ Graphic Library SDL2. SDL2(Simple Direct Media Layer) </strong>is a very famous and interactive module for <strong>Game development</strong> in <strong>C++</strong>. You are going to cover the very latest concepts of <strong>Game Development</strong> using <strong>SDL2</strong> in this course where we will be covering <strong>5 Games</strong> using <strong>SDL2</strong> each introducing new and interesting concepts for you to learn.</p><p><br></p><p>Each game is going to help you to learn more and more interesting concepts. At the end of this course I assure you that you will be able to create a totally new <strong>Game </strong>of your own requirements and specifications in <strong>SDL2</strong>. This course covers the latest concepts of <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>SDL2</strong>. Moreover if you no knowledge of <strong>C++</strong> or <strong>SDL2 </strong>or any other Programming Language then you don't have to worry about it. We have uploaded a <strong>C++ Crash Course</strong> at the end of this course that will help you gain a good knowledge of C++before you start on with the game development in SDL2.</p><p><br></p><p>Each <strong>Game</strong> that we have made in this course is independent from other games means that you don't have to take the 1st and 2nd Game in order to start the 3rd Game. You can make the <strong>Games</strong> in any order you see fit. We have talked a lot about <strong>SDL2</strong> in this course and what is actually behind the built-in stuff in <strong>SDL2</strong>. If you already know the basic of <strong>C++</strong> then there is no need to take the <strong>crash course</strong> which is in the last section of the course.</p><p><br></p><p>In the course, if you have any type of Questions or if you are having trouble understanding anything then you can directly reach out to me or you can ask your question in the <strong>Q/A section.</strong> I have attached the code with each lecture so that if you got stuck somewhere then you can use the code. There is couple of challenging <strong>assignments</strong> that will test your skills and how much you are learning in the course.</p><p><br></p><p>I wish you a very best of Luck with the Course.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks!</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>As a beginner, I struggled heavily with Roblox GUI. Even though it seems simple to me now, back then I had to learn what EVERY single GUI item does, how to properly script them, how to animate them, do client-to-server communication, etc<br><br>My goal with this course is to fully teach you about how Roblox GUI works. Instead of spending 2 years barely understanding GUI as I have, I will hold your hand throughout this entire process and guide you, step by step, to become an expert on Roblox GUI (and just on the concept of UI in general)<br><br>And don't worry, I won't just barrage you with information out of nowhere. I've consumed many guides in the past which did this, and that's an issue because I never remembered anything they would teach me. The ONLY&nbsp;method that would actually work for me was learning GUI when I actually needed the GUI. And bit by bit, I was able to fully grasp how Roblox GUI works<br><br>I have taken every little bit that I've learned about GUI over the years and stuffed them into this organized course. This course is meant to lead you to an expert level knowledge on GUI, avoiding all the mistakes that have slowed me down. If that sounds like a good offer, I hope to see you inside this course</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the <strong>Unity UI System</strong> course — your guide to creating <strong>ADVANCED and professional interfaces</strong> from scratch for your games.</p><p>This is a complete, real-case-based guide that teaches you how to design and adapt your game UI once and for all across all platforms in a professional way.</p><p>Creating UI can be the most complex part of your project if you don’t understand all elements or how to access them through code. You’ll waste precious time browsing documentation or videos trying to fix every small issue.</p><p>And even if you manage that, adapting your UI to different platforms becomes a nightmare — sometimes forcing you to duplicate projects just to make minor changes.</p><p>This is not a viable path if you want to work in professional game studios or position yourself as a serious game developer.</p><p>UI is not just for the main menu — you’ll use it for gameplay HUDs, inventories, level selectors, and settings screens. If you don’t connect all these properly, your project will become harder and harder to manage, and you'll stop building actual gameplay features.</p><p>That’s why we built this course — to help you master the Unity UI System step by step with real use cases you can implement directly in your own games.</p><p>We teach you how to access every UI element via code, mastering the full class and its features at an advanced level. You’ll have no limits when applying this to your games.</p><p>You'll also learn <strong>all C# interfaces of the Event System</strong>, so you can connect UI elements programmatically for <strong>high-performance</strong> and <strong>smooth gameplay</strong>.</p><p>You’ll build a <strong>full-featured RPG-style inventory system</strong> from scratch, applying everything in a real-world scenario.</p><p>You’ll <strong>master custom fonts</strong> to tailor your game’s look &amp; feel and enhance your project’s visual quality.</p><p>We’ll also build a <strong>complete settings screen with control rebinding</strong>, integrating with the new Input System to give players total control over their experience.</p><p>You can preview the course intro video before enrolling to explore the full curriculum and see how everything you learn will apply directly to your career and your games.</p><p>Your purchase is 100% guaranteed — if you're not satisfied, you can request a full refund within 30 days, no questions asked.</p><p>If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me via private message — I’ll personally help you to make sure your investment pays off in your journey to becoming a professional game developer.</p><p>See you inside the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p>This practical course aims at teaching you step by step how to create a game using <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>Qt</strong>. C++ is a very powerful programming language very suitable for making games, whilst Qt is a very large graphical user interface (GUI) framework fully based on C++. In this course you learn how to practically use C++ to create a GUI application and you also learn how to use and get familiar with the very powerful Qt framework.</p><p>The first aim of the course is to teach you how to plan a game. Essentially, you are going to learn how to turn your game ideas into <strong>Game Requirements</strong> for your Game application. You also learn how to meticulously organise them so as to be able to implement them incrementally, in a logical manner.</p><p>Secondly, you thoroughly learn about the<strong> Qt framework</strong>. Essentially, you learn how to navigate the massive documentation of the Qt framework, in order to be able to get the functionality that you need for your Game. Additionally, you learn step by step how to create a beautiful, coherent, and interactive graphical user interface with the Qt framework.</p><p>Thirdly, you methodically learn how to implement <strong>Game Logic</strong> using C++. Essentially, you finally become able to apply the theory of <strong>C++</strong> in an actual GUI application, in order to create a very entertaining <strong>TicTacToe Game</strong>. Quite simply, you learn how to practically use concepts like selection control structures, repetition control structures, functions, pointers, references, classes, objects, lifetime of objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.</p><p>Fourthly, you learn how to add <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (AI) to a Game Logic. Essentially, in this course, you learn how to create AI opponents that a human player can play against. You first learn how to create a weak AI&nbsp;opponent that a human player can easily defeat. Then you learn, step by step, thoroughly, how a tough AI&nbsp;opponent can be created, how it can be made to be very smart, and therefore very hard to defeat.</p><p>Finally, you get to have a go at the TicTacToe Game by yourself. Essentially, at the end of the course, you get a couple of <strong>Assignments</strong> where your tasks are about ameliorating and extending the Game. This is a means for you to test how much you have understood from the course.</p><p>Regarding the course itself, it is structured in a way that one section builds upon the previous ones. So this is essentially to tell you that not every section adds something new in the user interface or in the game logic. The sections are all interconnected, and in order to create the TicTacToe Game exhibited in the introduction video, you will have to go through the entire course, one video after the other.</p><p>I wish you a pleasant time as you navigate through the course.</p><p><br></p><p>Happy learning,</p><p>Alex</p>",

  "description": "<p>Elevate your game development skills by learning advanced programming techniques, coupled with in-depth asset creation using Blender and the creation of sophisticated game GUIs. This course focuses on advanced programming concepts essential for game development.<br><br>Many courses prioritize the visual aspects of game development, such as applying 3D assets and GUIs, but neglect to adequately teach crucial and advanced game programming concepts.<br><br>What are we programming?<br> This simulation is a gamified experience that teaches team management and the importance of being a team player. The game is designed in such a way that it cannot be won unless the entire team works together as a cohesive unit. Players are faced with various challenges that require effective communication, collaboration, and strategic decision-making. The game also incorporates elements of stress and risk, simulating real-world scenarios where team members must work together under pressure to achieve a common goal.</p><p>The simulation is set in a high-stakes environment, where the risk of failure is ever-present. Players must navigate through complex challenges, making quick decisions and adapting to changing circumstances. The game emphasizes the importance of trust, accountability, and mutual support, as players rely on each other to overcome obstacles and achieve success.</p><p>Through this simulation, players learn valuable skills such as leadership, communication, and problem-solving. They also gain a deeper understanding of the importance of teamwork and the role it plays in achieving success. By providing a realistic and engaging experience, this simulation offers a unique and effective way to teach team management and team player skills.<br><br>This comprehensive course covers game development using Roblox, Love2D, LoVR, Lua programming, and Blender 4.2. Master 3D math, springs, constraints, and advanced GUI elements in Roblox to unlock its full potential. Gain expertise in Love2D and LoVR, focusing on shaders and advanced techniques. Through Lua networking and object-oriented programming, create projects from scratch, such as a random generator, mini-games, and complex simulations that embody gamification principles, teaching valuable team and leadership skills. Design custom assets in Blender 4.2, incorporate sound effects, and delve deeper into programming concepts. This engaging and practical course offers a creative journey that merges innovation and mastery in game development.<br><br>Roblox physics encompasses a wide range of elements, including hinge, cylindrical, prismatic, plane, and spring constraints. Hinge constraints allow objects to rotate around a fixed point, while cylindrical and prismatic constraints enable linear motion along a specified axis. Plane constraints restrict movement to a specific plane, and spring constraints simulate the behavior of real-world springs. Additionally, Roblox supports advanced physics features like collision detection, gravity manipulation, and force application.</p><p>Animation in Roblox can be achieved through the use of Animation Controllers and Animation Tracks, which allow for the creation of complex character movements and interactions. Sound integration is also possible, with support for various audio formats and effects, enabling the creation of immersive game environments.</p><p>Advanced data saving in Roblox can be accomplished through the use of DataStores, which provide a persistent storage solution for game data. This allows for the creation of complex game mechanics, such as player progression, inventory management, and game state persistence. By mastering these features, developers can create engaging and dynamic games that offer a rich and immersive experience for players.<br><br>Roblox offers a wide range of advanced GUI features, including keyboard, gamepad, and touch controls. The GUI can be customized to respond to various inputs, allowing for a more immersive and interactive gameplay experience. Additionally, Roblox supports remote events and bindable events, enabling developers to create complex and dynamic GUI elements. The platform also offers advanced team management controls for team leaders, as well as advanced GUI features for team players. These features allow for greater flexibility and customization in game development, enabling developers to create engaging and dynamic games.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to the Procedural Plant Generation course!</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, we will explore the fascinating world of procedural generation of plants. Plants are complex natural structures that have always been a source of inspiration for artists, architects, and scientists. With the development of procedural generation algorithms, we can now create realistic, fantastic and diverse plant structures in a fraction of the time it would take to manually model them.</p><p><br></p><p>The course is divided into four main parts. </p><p><br></p><p>First, I will quickly introduce this course, my pedagogy, and we will cover the latest scientific research on procedural plant generation, the advantages and drawbacks of procedural generation inside videogames and the project that will structure this course.</p><p><br></p><p>In the second part, we will explain the theoretical approach behind procedural mesh generation. We will see the basic theory to understand how to create procedural plant with coordinate systems, vectors and some mathematics calculations.</p><p><br></p><p>The third part is subdivided respectfully into 3 parts corresponding to theses algorithms: Space Colonization with Animation System, LSystem &amp; Semi-Procedural approach. It's the heart of this course. We will see how to generate for these 3 algorithms a plant global form with Catmull-Rom Spline and also how to animate it smoothly.</p><p><br></p><p>The last part will show how to integrate external assets inside LSystem Plant Generation to create a basic timelapse.</p><p><br></p><p>It is important to note that this course DOES NOT COVER topics such as : </p><ul><li><p>Procedural Terrain Generation</p></li><li><p>Specific Flower / Tree / Plant Species Generation &amp; Animation</p></li><li><p>Procedural Generation of Specific Parts of Flower / Tree / Plant like Leaves / Petals / Buds / Fruits etc.</p></li></ul><p>However, you will understand and learn the essential skills to create meshes looking like plants, from a coding perspective and how to integrate asset resources (3D models &amp; 2D sprites) on it to enhance your creations.</p><p><br></p><p>Lastly, I want to emphasize that all the assets used in the projects are free to be used, as long as the creators are cited and all conditions of their respective license are filled. I really want to encourage the use of free resources and the support of talented creators.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether you are an artist, a (game) developer, or a computer graphics enthusiast, this course will provide you with the knowledge and tools to create your own procedurally generated plants. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of the theory and practice of procedural plant generation, and you will be able to create your own complex plant structures, realistic or on the contrary completely unreal. </p><p><br></p><p>Let's get started!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>We at Mammoth Interactive value input from students like you. Feel free to leave us your feedback. </strong></p><p><strong>Why SpriteKit?</strong></p><p>SpriteKit is the framework for making 2D games for Apple products. It's <strong>​free</strong>​! You can make cool games, from super simple to more complex, in SpriteKit. SpriteKit provides support for cool special effects and physics. It's a ​<strong>fun</strong>​ interface to express your creativity. Before you know it, you could see a game you built in SpriteKit in the App Store!</p><p>To give a game functionality, you add code to your game's objects in Xcode. Xcode is a user-friendly programming language that is easy to understand.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anyone can use SpriteKit.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In this course, you learn how to make simple 2D games using Apple's SpriteKit. You build the following games: Breakout Clone, Pong Clone, and Space Invaders. This course is unique because we make <strong>​both the code and the design</strong> ​for the games from scratch.&nbsp;</p><p>Other tutorials only show you how to make the functionality or design of a game. We at Mammoth Interactive show you how to do both.&nbsp;</p><p>Don't worry if you've never coded before. We ​<strong>start simple</strong>​ and add more to the game as the course goes on. This course begins with an introduction to SpriteKit for those who have never used it before. You will learn how to navigate SpriteKit's interface.</p><p><em>The beauty of taking an online course like this is the ability to replay any of the lectures at any time. There is no time limit or final tests. ​Y</em><strong><em>ou get to learn at your own pace with a practical model method of learning.</em></strong></p><p><em>One of the best features is that you can watch the courses at any speed you want. This means you can speed up or slow down the video if you want to.</em></p><p>This course is ​<strong>project-based​</strong> so you will not be learning a bunch of useless coding practices. At the end of this course you will have real world apps to use in your portfolio.&nbsp;</p><p>We feel that project based training content is the best way to get from A to B. Taking this course means that you learn practical, employable ​<strong>skills immediately</strong>.</p><p>You can use the projects you build in this course to add to your LinkedIn profile. Give your portfolio fuel to take your career to the next level.</p><p>Learning how to code is a great way to jump in a new career or enhance your current career. Coding is the new math and learning how to code will propel you forward for any situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn it today and get a head start for tomorrow. ​<strong><em>People who can master technology will rule the future.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Is this course for me?</strong></p><p>Even if you're not an artist, you can design basic games. You may have heard of Axiom Verge and Stardew Valley. These games are million-dollar successes. But did you know that only one person made each?</p><p>Usually it takes a whole team of people to build a game. But creators Thomas Happ and Eric Barone developed and designed their games by themselves. Now they're millionaires. You can do it, too.</p><p>By taking this course, you will gain the tools you need to continue improving yourself in the field of game development. You will be able to apply what you learned to further experiment in SpriteKit or any other game development framework.</p><p>Also now included in these bundles are our extra courses. If you want to learn to use other programs such as Camtasia or Sketch, you get more content than what you paid for this way!</p><p>We really hope you decide to purchase this course and take your knowledge to the next level. Let's get started.</p><p><strong>Enroll now to join the Mammoth community!</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>## Learn Unity Game Development: Create Games with C# from Scratch</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever dreamed of making your own video games but didn’t know where to start? Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced coder looking to break into game development, this course is your perfect starting point.</p><p><br></p><p>**Unity** is one of the most powerful and widely-used game engines in the world. It’s used not only to build hit games for mobile, PC, and consoles, but also for architectural visualization, VR/AR, simulations, and even medical applications. The only challenge? Unity can be overwhelming for beginners — but that’s exactly where this course comes in.</p><p><br></p><p>### Why This Course?</p><p><br></p><p>We make learning Unity and C# programming **fun, easy, and practical**. Instead of starting with dry theory, you’ll jump straight into creating real games. This project-based approach keeps you motivated and helps you immediately apply what you learn. By the end of the course, you’ll have built several fully functional games from scratch — and have a deep understanding of Unity, C# scripting, and game development workflows.</p><p><br></p><p>### What You’ll Learn:</p><p><br></p><p>- The Unity interface, tools, and core workflows&nbsp; </p><p>- Fundamentals of C# programming for game development&nbsp; </p><p>- Game physics, collisions, player controls, and interactions&nbsp; </p><p>- 2D and 3D game development essentials&nbsp; </p><p>- Building UI (menus, score systems, buttons, etc.)&nbsp; </p><p>- Creating multiple complete games, step-by-step&nbsp; </p><p>- Exporting your game to multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Android, Web, etc.)&nbsp; </p><p>- Best practices for clean code, game design, and optimization&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>Whether you want to build a personal portfolio, launch your own indie game, or prepare for a career in game development, this course will give you the foundation you need.</p><p><br></p><p>### Why Learn from Us?</p><p><br></p><p>- **Experienced Instructors** – Our instructors are skilled game developers and passionate educators who make complex concepts simple and fun.</p><p>- **Project-Based Learning** – Learn by doing. Build actual games as you go.</p><p>- **Lifetime Access** – Enroll once and get access to all current and future content — forever.</p><p>- **Supportive Community** – Ask questions and get help whenever you need it.</p><p><br></p><p>### Who This Course Is For:</p><p><br></p><p>- Complete beginners who want to learn programming through game development&nbsp; </p><p>- Aspiring game developers looking for a hands-on introduction to Unity and C#&nbsp; </p><p>- Existing coders (especially C# developers) wanting to switch to game dev&nbsp; </p><p>- Hobbyists, students, or anyone excited to create their own video games&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>No prior experience in coding or game design is required — just a computer and a passion for learning.</p><p><br></p><p>---</p><p><br></p><p>**Enroll now and start building your first Unity game today!** With expert guidance, a hands-on approach, and engaging projects, you’ll be amazed at what you can create.</p><p><br></p><p>Let's build something awesome together!</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Please read requirement first, learners need to have basic understanding of C++. </strong></p><p><strong>Or I recommend you take basic level C++ course first. </strong></p><p><br></p><p>UPDATES:</p><p>2024.10.12 : All auto-generated captions are corrected.</p><p><br></p><p>Welcome to \"<strong>Create Zeldar-like skills with C++ in unreal engine 5</strong>\"! You will learn how to create a skill framework which can handle various abilities including remote bomb, magnesis, stasis and ice actor, and basic locomotion states such as sprinting, gliding and exhausted states. I prepared reference projects for every lesson so when you are stuck in any lesson you can freely download them and compare your own project with them! Don't worry about making mistakes, learn from them!</p><p><br></p><p>In the first section, we're going to <strong>setup project and implement basic locomotion states</strong> for player character from scratch in C++. With enhanced input system and locomotion manage, these customized actions will be triggered when player character meets certain conditions. For example, once player character is falling from high place and having enough stamina, gliding action is available. If stamina is depleted, player character cannot jump, sprint or gliding anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, we will design and <strong>create a powerful framework to manage various skills before any skill creation</strong>. Only one skill could be activated at one time. Thanks to the convienient communication between blueprint and c++ in unreal engine, we can easily transfer information from UI to our code base. It is the best way to take advantage of them. Blueprint is more convenient for visual design and c++ is more performant for game in general.</p><p><br></p><p>Thirdly, we're focus on several kinds of different skills including <strong>remote bombs, magnesis, stasis and ice actor spawning</strong>. In remote bomb skill, a bomb will be spawned and player character can throw it out. When it explodes on breakable wall, it will crash and if it explodes on grass, a tempory wind tunnel will be spawned, which might be helpful for player to solve puzzles in the game. Sure I will introduce more details in the course. Though their logics are totally different, they all in the same skill framework so developer can easily add new skill types. </p><p><br></p><p>At last, several useful gameplay object will be implemented for better play experience. Those objects must be compatible with skill framework. For example, <strong>interactable object</strong> such as rock will be added. When player is holding a rock but trying to activate a skill, this rock must be dropped first. Similarly, <strong>pressure plate, wind tunnel, breakable walls</strong> will be implemented.</p><p><br></p><p>You can also join my discord to ask question or in udemy Q&amp;A part. With detailed reference project provided in each lecture and a step-by-step approach, what are you waiting for? Join the course and there's no better time to start your own dream project now! </p>",

  "description": "<p>This. Is. It. Part 3 and The final chapter in our UE5 Sci-Fi VFX Series for Game Production. And we’re going out with a Bang. We’ll be diving into more advanced material work with our Energy Shield and deeper methods for prototyping VFX in our Blueprints and Niagara Systems for our Energy shield.</p><p><br></p><p>First we are going to focus on creating our sci-fi energy shield and hook up our automated Turret VFX.</p><p><br></p><p>The focus will be all about more complex material creation through detailed, animated masks and implementing a modular based structure for faster iteration and alteration in order to strike a balance between art direction and gameplay needs. We will wrap that section up in our blueprints by creating spawn logic from our Player Character. We will work on defining proper collision logic and drive certain material parameters through timelines to animate our shield kicking on and off. And of course we will make sure to hook up all of our VFX for our turrets to properly test our shield against enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>In the final section we will make a really satisfying Pulse Grenade.</p><p><br></p><p>We will reuse assets we created in Part 2 of the course from our Laser Beam and Plasma Blaster VFX. You will still be able to follow along if you missed that part, but you will be missing assets that will be used heavily in this course. You may create your own, however, if you wish to fill in the gaps and apply knowledge you already have. We will have a lot of fun creating ways for our Blueprints to be used to create dynamically changing strike points for our lightning arcs by exposing parameters in our Niagara Systems. We will go through some preliminary tests to make sure our beams are working correctly.</p><p><br></p><p>Then we will add more detail to our lightning arcs in our Niagara systems to give them some more shape and dynamic animation. We will even explore some additional material logic in our bonus section by creating a function to make sure our beams stay consistent in their emissive values from various distances.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of Part 3 you will not only have some really cool portfolio pieces, but a better understanding of how to create and prototype many other VFX by leveraging the power of Unreal Materials, Blueprints and Niagara Systems.</p><p><br></p><p>So, hop on in and lets get crafting!</p><p><br></p>",

Whether you’ve built apps before or are completely new to game programming, this course will guide you step by step in building fun and interactive 2D games using the Flame game engine.</p><p>We’ll start with an introduction to Flame and explore the essential building blocks like text, shapes, movement, timers, tap events, and collision detection. From there, you’ll put your skills into practice by creating <strong>Ramp Hit Game</strong>, a brick-breaker style game with collisions, reflections, obstacles, and sound effects.</p><p>Next, you’ll learn how to work with sprites, sprite sheets, animations, and parallax backgrounds, and then dive into an action-packed <strong>Space Shooter Game</strong> complete with enemies, shooting mechanics, explosions, scoring, and a camera that follows the player.</p><p>In the advanced sections, we’ll explore <strong>Forge2D</strong>, Flame’s physics engine, where you’ll learn about bodies, gravity, and physics-driven components. You’ll then apply these concepts by building <strong>Color Catch Game</strong>, where balls must be sorted into the correct buckets using physics, collisions, and creative rendering techniques.</p><p>By the end of this course, you won’t just know Flame basics—you’ll have built multiple complete games and gained the confidence to design and develop your own unique 2D games with Flutter and Flame.</p>",

By the end of this course you will have a template you can begin any of your future tvOS apps with.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Create a Side Scroller Game for tvOS or iOS - Session 1</strong><br></p>\n\n<p>In this series you will learn how to create a retro 2d-style side scroller game from scratch for the new tvOS or for iOS. The project will be initially developed using the tvOS template, then you'll see how to take most of the same code and use it for an iOS app. We'll cover all the essentials to making a side scroller: building a physics-based environment (with platforms, vines, pipes, collectibles), programming a an easy character to move using swipes, adding the HUD (for things like Score or a Lives label), sound and much, much more. Toward the end of this session we'll also discuss how to add a tvOS target to an existing iOS project and share code / assets between the two targets.<br></p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Create a Side Scroller Game for tvOS or iOS - Session 2</strong><br></p>\n\n<p>The epic saga continues in this second session all about how to make a 2D side scroller for tvOS or iOS. We'll look at turning our GameScene into more of a \"game engine\" by incorporating a property list to change variables on a per-level basis. We'll also talk about scoring, moving platforms (that carry the player), \"dead zones\" to kill the player, restarting from continue points, inventory, and much more!<br></p>",

We will mass process assets and actors using <strong>Scripted Actions</strong>.</p><p>We will dive both into Asset Action Utilities and Actor Action Utilities.<br>Those will let you batch rename assets, fix texture compression settings, modify editor properties, remove unused assets, work with metadata tags and more.</p><p>It should be enough to make you familiar with this kind of Blueprints.</p><p><br></p><p>Then we will take it to the next level and start creating <strong>tools with custom UI</strong>.</p><p>We will explore UMG widget editor, design our own Utility Widgets, create custom list view and then use it in Lights Manager tool.</p><p><br></p><p>Tutorials in this course are not just 'do what I do' videos. I've put effort into making sure that you know why I do certain things and even though there may be some simplifications at the beginning, there are separate videos made to fill the gaps. Expect explanations on <em>Tick</em> function performance, what are Interfaces, or when to use <em>Cast </em>node and when to use <em>Is A </em>node instead.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>100% of the course content was recorded on Unreal Engine 5.</strong></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Hi! My name is Domen and this is where you start developing 3D games. I created this class on 3D game development to show how easy it really is to start developing your own games. We will learn how to set up the basic prototype of first person shooter game with Unity. During the class, we will discover how to write scripts for the player and other game objects. We will write code from scratch for everything: movement, mouse rotation, shooting and many more. We will see how to set up a simple level and how to add the user interface to the game. We will create different platforms, from bouncy to deadly ones. We will also learn how to trigger transitions between scenes, how to add bonus objects and so much more. For this course you will need to have installed Unity3D and Visual Studio. I am using Unity version 2020.1, but for this course any should work. Course is beginner friendly and I really try to explain everything that we do in details. If you will have any questions, I&nbsp;will be happy to help. During the course, we will design level 1 and I&nbsp;would love to see you try building level 2.</p>",

(Everything described within this course can be applied in Unreal Engine 4 as well as Unreal Engine 5).</p><p>The course goes through all the fundamentals of creating a blueprints based playable packaged 1v1 game, starting from controller, inputs, to materials, to vfx, UI, up to handle ear candy &amp; eye candy. Starting from a totally empty project, and ending up with a fully packaged (bugs free) playable game.</p><p>For the past 5 years, this course be educated in private groups and different other platforms, now it's the time to bring it to you here at udemy! Wish you all the best in that journey &amp; keep on making games :)</p><p><br></p><p>Disclaimr: The \"Tanks\" game is a property of Unity3d, so hence if you want to access it, you need to use a Unity3d account to install Unity3d Engine and get a version of the game's project files from the Unity3d AssetStore.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome!</p><p>In this course, you’ll learn how to <strong>create your own 2D games in C++20 with SFML 3</strong> — through a complete, step-by-step journey that makes game development both accessible and exciting.</p><p>You don’t need to be an expert to get started. Together, we’ll start simple and gradually move on to more advanced concepts, always by building real projects and seeing the results on screen.</p><p>The course is divided into <strong>five main sections</strong>. We begin with <strong>Modern C++</strong>, where you’ll learn the essential features of the language in a practical, game-oriented way. Then we move on to <strong>SFML 3</strong>, the library that handles all the visuals, input, and audio. After that, we’ll build our <strong>first game, Bounce</strong>, before creating our own <strong>2D engine</strong> — the reusable foundation that powers all future projects. Finally, we’ll reach the <strong>Games section</strong>, where we’ll build <strong>new games every week</strong>, each one introducing new gameplay mechanics.</p><p>Everything is explained clearly and demonstrated in real time. You’ll understand not only how things work, but also why. Each project is short, focused, and rewarding — designed to improve both your C++ skills and your confidence as a game developer.</p><p>By the end of the course, you’ll have the knowledge, the tools, and the experience to keep creating your own games from scratch — and have a lot of fun doing it.</p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course, we’ll start by building a clean, simple base material with essential controls for Base Color, Roughness, AO, Metallic, and Normal adjustments.</p><p>From there, we level up — adding detail normals, object radius-based tiling, custom tiling parameters, and a texture variation function to push visual quality even further.</p><p>Next, we dive into 2-way material blending, exploring multiple blending techniques. That sets us up to create a DFAO shader featuring various blending types, including Z-up masking for terrain and props.</p><p>We’ll then repurpose our existing material functions to create a stacked layer material — showing you how to reuse your tools efficiently across different material types while keeping everything organized and scalable.</p><p>You'll also build a glass condensation shader, complete with fogging, refraction, water droplets, and running water — featuring a dynamic 4-way masking system, reusable in other FX and perfect for cinematics and high-fidelity projects.</p><p>We’ll cover Parallax Occlusion Mapping, then tackle auto terrain materials using slope masks and edge noise to drive natural transitions for large environments.</p><p>From there, it’s VFX time: advanced flipbook setups, Niagara integration, Embergen basics, and VDB workflows — everything you need to craft cinematic real-time effects.</p><p>You’ll reuse flipbooks to create atmospheric burnup and wind resistance effects, develop a chameleon shader that blends characters into surfaces, and construct a dynamic multi-layered hologram.</p><p>And finally? We bring it all together in the toxic river — a complex effect combining everything we’ve learned into one stunning showcase.</p><p>This course is built for generalists who want to work smarter, not harder — and leave with a flexible toolkit ready for production.</p><p>Let’s build.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Creating an awesome game in Unity is never been easier than these days will all the features that Unity provides for the community. You might have a lot of game ideas with you and you wish to implement them in real life instead of having them in your mind only. This course you will learn step by step how to create an Endless Runner Game with Unity from start to finish.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is divided to sections in each one of these sections you will learn new things to be able in the end of the course to build a full game in Unity. The first section is introduction to the course and installing Unity Application to your computer then make the initial design of the game in photoshop. The second section we start to work with the game environment, adding the player, adding the enemy and coins. Then we created a spawner which spawn enemies and coins each second. Then we work with game collision system to make player die if hit an enemy or collect points if hit one of the coins and we store these coins or scores in a data container.</p><p>In section three we created the game UI for the main level, the main menu and the game shop. We make the UI scale with screen size and make it look good in different screens. The in section four we added audio to the game. We added background audio and another audio when collecting coins. Then in section five we added characters to the game from one of the free online tools for characters and animation “Mixamo”. We implemented the animation in our game and we add new coin shape to our coins. The last section we create swipe control for our game so we can play in in the mobile phone. Finally we build the game and run it into an android phone and test it.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the course and feel free to ask and write your questions under each section.</p>",

We will talk about modules, their structure and how the sequence of modules affects the crowd effect in Unreal Engine 5. Then we will consolidate our knowledge with an example of creating fire and proceed to create a crowd of rats in Unreal Engine 5. First we'll Create the vertex animation shader, then we'll move on to creating and customizing particles in Unreal Engine. Next, we'll customize the character, retarget and move the crosshairs, and customize the weapons and animations in Unreal Engine. We'll also Create a flamethrower effect and make its action as realistic as possible in a crowd of rats in Unreal Engine. Next, we'll work with Blueprints and learn how to locally kill particles in a crowd in Unreal Engine 5. This is a very interesting point. We will also learn how to work with Blueprints in the Niagara system.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, we will customize our effect, also learn all the points and learn how to work professionally in Unreal Engine 5.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Ready to transform your ideas into playable experiences? Whether you’re an absolute beginner or have dabbled in coding before, this <strong>GDScript-driven Godot Masterclass</strong> guides you from zero to building real, interactive games—step by step.</p><p>In this hands-on course, you’ll learn to code with <strong>GDScript</strong>, the intuitive scripting language tailored for the <strong>Godot 4 game engine</strong>. We start from the very basics—setting up the engine, writing your first line of code, and creating a simple scene—and progress all the way to full-featured games packed with animation, interactivity, and smart logic.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Build and Learn:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Create multiple <strong>2D games</strong> from scratch, including platformers, arcade-style challenges, and even a full logic-based puzzle game.</p></li><li><p>Master <strong>GDScript fundamentals</strong>, including variables, data types, conditions, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming with custom classes.</p></li><li><p>Use powerful Godot features like <strong>signals</strong>, <strong>HUD scenes</strong>, and <strong>AnimationPlayer</strong> to create dynamic, responsive gameplay.</p></li><li><p>Implement <strong>Singletons (AutoLoad scripts)</strong> to manage global game state and polish your architecture for scalable design.</p></li><li><p>Explore UI design, parallax backgrounds, collision detection, enums, tweening, and scene transitions with clarity and control.</p></li></ul><p>Each module is structured to build progressively, combining real code and real projects with clear teaching and demos. You won’t just follow along—you’ll build, experiment, and evolve as a game developer with every lesson.</p><p>By the end of this course, you’ll have:</p><ul><li><p>Confidence in writing clean GDScript code</p></li><li><p>A portfolio of <strong>completed mini-games</strong></p></li><li><p>A deep understanding of <strong>Godot 4</strong> workflows and scripting architecture</p></li><li><p>The tools to build your own original games from the ground up</p></li></ul><p>No prior experience required—just curiosity, creativity, and a love for games.</p><p>Whether you want to become an indie developer, make games for fun, or prepare for a studio role, this course gives you the real-world foundations to start building your dreams. Let’s turn code into gameplay—<strong>from scratch.</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>Unlock the potential of <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> in Unity by mastering <strong>Behavior Trees</strong> in this hands-on, practical course. Together, we’ll build a fully autonomous \"Hide and Seek\" game with <strong>Adaptive AI</strong> that learns and evolves. </p><p>Designed for beginner and intermediate game developers and designers with a passion for AI, this step-by-step course will guide you from the basics to advanced techniques.</p><p>We'll begin by exploring the fundamentals of Behavior Trees using the <strong>Behavior Designer</strong> plugin for <strong>Unity</strong>, setting a solid foundation. Then, we'll get our hands dirty by building simple AI examples to understand core concepts. From there, we’ll dive deep into the advanced area by creating our fully autonomous \"Hide and Seek\" game, where AI-driven characters will strategize and adapt without any player input. To enhance the gameplay experience, we'll create a UI that displays stats and information, making it easier to analyse AI behaviour. Finally, we'll take things to the next level by implementing AI adaptation, allowing our agents to learn from their experiences and adjust their behaviour dynamically using database techniques similar to machine learning.</p><p>This course includes a demo version of <strong>Behavior Designer</strong>, ensuring you have all the tools you need to succeed. Plus, you'll enjoy lifetime access to the course, allowing you to learn at your own pace and revisit the material whenever you need.</p><p>Join us on this exciting journey and take your AI development skills to new heights!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Hey there, and welcome to my course on the basics of Unity!</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, we will be covering all of the basics of the well-known Unity Game Engine, ranging from Unity's workflow to C#, and from Sound Design to Particle Systems and Feedback Concepts. This course will cover everything you need to know when creating your first game in Unity.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the last few years, I have created 4 mobile games, entirely on my own, and released them for free on Google's Play Store. Now, using the knowledge I acquired, I created this course, as a concise yet detailed tutorial on how to develop games in Unity. <br></p><p>Learning a game engine entirely from scratch can be a difficult task, and I for one have spent many hours reading through forum posts and manuals in the hopes that someone can explain a concept I was struggling with. Fortunately, learning these concepts got easier with time, and allowed me to gain a relatively detailed understanding of how Unity works. In this course, I'll be passing on everything that I learned to you. </p><p><br></p><p>If you decide to enrol, you'll be making a wise choice, as knowing how to develop games, especially in Unity, is an incredibly useful skill to have in today's world, and by learning this skill, you'll be making a smart investment in your future. Additionally,&nbsp;creating your own games in Unity is an amazing experience and an incredible creative outlet. By enrolling in this course, you'll be accelerating the time it takes for you to become an adept game developer by an exceptional amount, allowing you to get started on your masterpiece as soon as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope I get to teach you this valuable skill and thank you for taking the time to read my course's description. Your interest is greatly appreciated!</p><p><br></p><p>Have a great day! :)</p>",

  "description": "<p>In this project-based course, you'll use LangChain and the OpenAI API to transform game ideas into intelligent, interactive experiences. We'll begin by establishing the fundamentals that make LLM systems predictable and cost-effective: prompt templates that separate content from structure, chains that combine multiple steps into reliable workflows, callbacks for tracing and telemetry, and memory strategies that keep context tight without increasing token costs. </p><p>Once these building blocks are ready, you'll move on to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), enabling NPCs to answer questions and make decisions based on your own game lore and documents. You'll also create agents that safely call in-game tools through validated, schema-driven function calls and strict allowlists. Throughout the course, you'll instrument your code, test behaviors deterministically, and implement guardrails to ensure outputs stay on policy. The course concludes with two platformer mini-games in which an agent and NPCs compete, adapting strategies using memory and retrieval to outplay each other. By the end, you'll have a reusable toolkit—prompts, chains, memory, RAG, and agents, along with portfolio-ready demos you can extend or deploy.</p><p><strong>What you'll build &amp; learn</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>OpenAI API fundamentals:</strong> streaming, reliable JSON/structured outputs, and function (tool) calling.</p></li><li><p><strong>LangChain I/O &amp; prompts:</strong> PromptTemplate, ChatPromptTemplate, few-shot patterns, and output validation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chains:</strong> sequential and router chains, batching/streaming, retries, and cost/latency tuning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Callbacks &amp; tracing:</strong> observe runs end-to-end and debug model/tool behavior with clear telemetry.</p></li><li><p><strong>Memory:</strong> buffer, summary, and vector-backed memory with persistence, TTLs, and guardrails.</p></li><li><p><strong>RAG:</strong> loaders → chunking → embeddings → retrievers → grounded answers with citations and filters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Agents:</strong> ReAct/function-calling agents with strict schemas, allowlists, timeouts, and safeguards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Games:</strong> two AI platformers where agent/NPC strategies evolve based on retrieved knowledge and remembered context.</p></li></ul><p>You'll finish with practical, production-shaped patterns you can reuse in games, chat assistants, or any interactive LLM application.</p>",
