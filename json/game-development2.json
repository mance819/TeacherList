  "description": "<p><strong>This course has been updated to Unity 6, but is still compatible with older versions of Unity.</strong></p><p><strong>This is the long-awaited&nbsp;sequel to the Complete Unity Developer </strong>- one of the most popular e-learning courses on the internet!<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Completely re-worked from scratch with&nbsp;<strong>brand-new projects </strong>and&nbsp;our latest teaching techniques. You will&nbsp;benefit from the fact <strong>we have already taught over 2 million students</strong>&nbsp;programming and&nbsp;game development, many shipping commercial games as a result.</p><p>Unity is an incredible 3D&nbsp;package&nbsp;used for making video games,&nbsp;architectural and medical imaging and more. The challenge is that&nbsp;it's big and complicated to use, especially <strong>for complete beginners to coding and game development</strong>. We make <strong>learning to code easy and fun </strong>by leading you step-by-step through the process of&nbsp;<strong>creating exciting&nbsp;games.</strong></p><p>Get plugged into our communities of amazing developers on Facebook (nearly 20k), in our own Teaching Assistant-curated Community, and our student Discord chat channel.</p><p>If you're reading this you probably already have everything you need to get started. Unity is a free download. With&nbsp;regular access to an internet connection you'll be able to&nbsp;engage in our thriving community.<strong>&nbsp;Even if you have no experience with coding, or with 3D packages</strong>, we will guide you through everything from first principles. Starting slow, then building on what you learn, you'll soon have a very solid working knowledge of Unity.</p><p>You’ll <strong>build five fun games</strong>, each teaching you key skills in game development. From the basics like variables and collision detection to more advanced stuff like procedural generation and AI, you’ll master it all - while dodging obstacles and blasting aliens!</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Create an '<strong>Obstacle Dodge</strong>' game. Learn player input, collisions, variables, and if statements. It's the perfect way to get your feet wet in Unity.</p></li><li><p>Launch into \"<strong>Rocket Boost</strong>\", a physics-based game. Mess around with forces, namespaces, and classes. Push that rocket—and your skills—even further!</p></li><li><p>Gear up for \"<strong>Galaxy Strike</strong>\", an old-school rail shooter. Master Unity's terrain and timeline tools while coding arrays, for-loops, and coroutines. Arcade fun with a modern twist!</p></li><li><p>Craft a procedural endless runner in '<strong>Royal Run</strong>'. Build worlds that never stop, use lists, pickups, animations, post-processing, and more.</p></li><li><p>Get your eye in on \"<strong>Sharp Shooter</strong>\", a first-person shooter. Tackle nav mesh agents, enemy AI, weapon switching, raycasting, and prototyping levels with ProBuilder. Because who doesn't want to make an FPS?</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Don't take our word for it, please <strong>see the amazing&nbsp;reviews</strong> students have taken the time to write. We are proud to be transforming lives, and equipping 1000s of people with valuable new skills. We would love you to become one of them now.</p><p>The course is&nbsp;<strong>project-based</strong>, so you will not just be learning dry programming concepts, but applying them immediately to real indie games as you go. All the project files will be included, as well as additional references and resources - you'll never get stuck. There are \"talking heads\", powerful diagrams, quality screencasts and more.</p><p>For each demo game you build you will follow this process...</p><ul><li><p>Be challenged to build the entire game yourself.</p></li><li><p>Be shown step-by step how to build it.</p></li><li><p>Be challenged to apply, and re-apply your knowledge regularly.</p></li></ul><p>Prefer to focus on 2D? Check-out our <em>Complete Unity Developer 2D</em> course. Want something a little more advanced? Check-out our epic <em>Unity RPG</em>&nbsp;course. Want to get certified, get a job, or learn environment art - we've got you covered. <strong>The green leaf logo is your sign of quality.</strong></p><p>You will get full&nbsp;<strong>lifetime access</strong>&nbsp;for a single one-off fee. The creators are qualified and experienced coders and avid gamers, so are able to explain complex concepts clearly, as well as entertain along the way.</p><p><strong>What this course DOESN'T cover...</strong></p><p>Here are some things we will <strong>not</strong> be covering in detail...</p><ul><li><p>Art asset creation (assets provided but not made on-screen).</p></li><li><p>Advanced performance optimization.</p></li><li><p>Editor plugins or modifications.</p></li><li><p>Physics engine modification.</p></li></ul><p>Anyone who wants to learn to create games:&nbsp;<strong>Unity 3D is a fantastic platform which enables you to make production-quality games.</strong>&nbsp;Furthermore these games can be created for Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android and Web from a single source!</p><p><strong>Dive in now, you won't be disappointed!</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p><br></p><p><strong>** This course has been updated as of June 19, 2023! ** <br><br>*** Now includes the ENTIRE ultimate guide series! 20+ hours of new content added!<br><br>This course is authorized by and made in partnership with Unity Technologies.</strong><br></p><p>If you are interested in developing amazing, commercial-quality games that are playable on a variety of platforms, then you've come to the right place.<strong> This&nbsp;Unity&nbsp;course is the only one of its kind that is&nbsp;approved&nbsp;by Unity Technologies on Udemy</strong>. <strong>What better way to learn how to develop games in Unity than with their authorized&nbsp;course? </strong><em>The Ultimate Guide to Game Development with Unity</em>&nbsp;introduces you to the Unity Engine and to the fundamentals of C# programming. The course then&nbsp;dives into developing your first 2D and 3D games. You will discover how to set your games apart from the crowd by polishing them with Unity’s latest features, including post-processing effects and&nbsp;the animation system.</p><p><strong>In this Unity course, you will:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Master C# concepts such as variables and if statements</p></li><li><p>Detect collisions, receive user input, and create player movements</p></li><li><p>Create power-ups including triple shots, laser beams, speed boosts, and shields</p></li><li><p>Apply shaders that transform your game backgrounds</p></li><li><p>Create enemies with basic AI behavior </p></li><li><p>Collect and destroy game objects </p></li><li><p>Implement sound effects, background music, and particle effects</p></li><li><p>Activate and use Unity’s Team Collaboration service</p></li><li><p>Navigate the Unity Engine and discover unique features such as the Asset Store</p></li><li><p>Deploy your game to over 20 web or mobile platforms using Unity</p></li><li><p>And more! </p></li></ul><p>This Unity course also includes&nbsp;<strong>over 200 interactive challenges (New Content Added Weekly!)</strong> where you can test your knowledge with concepts you've just learned. These challenges will help you&nbsp;build three commercial-quality games: a <strong>2D Galaxy Shooter Game</strong> with polished sprites and cinematic effects, a <strong>3D Click to Move Stealth Game,</strong> and a <strong>2D Dungeon Crawler Mobile Game</strong>. Get access to the unique artwork provided by&nbsp;this Unity course and add sophisticated features to your games that make you look like you’ve been programming for years.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why Learn Game Development with Unity? </strong></p><p>The gaming industry is a $200 billion&nbsp;industry worldwide. By 2025, that number is expected to be near $300 billion. With <strong>Unity being the most widely used engine to develop games across multiple platforms</strong>, there has never been a better time to get into the field. As you will learn, the types of games you can create with Unity and C# are limitless. Game development makes a great hobby, allowing you to learn a new skill and play your game with family and friends. It is also an exciting and rewarding career, where&nbsp;plenty of successful&nbsp;developers, including myself, have learned the&nbsp;fundamentals of game development through courses like this, and not in the traditional classroom setting. <strong>Every great game starts somewhere, so why not make it yours? </strong>While people often find coding or making games intimidating, this Unity course utilizes a unique teaching method that will allow you to gain a thorough understanding of concepts while you develop your own games. Thanks to the Unity community, you’ll be able to connect with other developers, work together on new projects, and make some incredible games!<br><br></p><p><strong>Why Learn From Me</strong></p><p>This is the first and only Unity&nbsp;game development course that has been co-created with Unity Technologies on Udemy. &nbsp;Because learning to code can be daunting, Unity Technologies wanted to create a course that helps new developers feel comfortable exploring the engine and developing games. I believe that the best way to learn how to code is by doing. Therefore, <strong>this is a highly interactive series&nbsp;that does not spoon-feed you the answers. </strong>The unique challenges integrated throughout this Unity course will ensure&nbsp;you not only know how to code something, but&nbsp;also understand the logic behind it. As a <strong>self-taught software engineer</strong>, I found that there simply weren’t any high-quality video tutorials&nbsp;that allowed beginners to truly grasp concepts essential to game development. To remedy this, I created my own YouTube video series focused on Unity game development, where I’ve had the privilege of helping thousands of other people grow their passion for game development. &nbsp;</p><p>I’ve been working in Unity since the initial public release of version 2.6, and I’ve authored a book on Unity 3.X. Since beginning my career in software development, I’ve been fortunate enough to develop games for Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, and several indie game companies. I’ve also developed enterprise augmented reality applications for Fortune 500 companies like Coca-Cola, GE, and Thyssenkrupp. Teaching has always been a passion of mine, and I hope you will see that throughout this course. &nbsp;</p><p>Upon completing this Unity course, you will understand the concepts of C# programming and be able to continue developing your own 2D and 3D games. You will also feel confident knowing that you have mastered the latest and greatest game development techniques that will propel you to success in your professional or personal aspirations.</p><p><strong>Join me on this adventure today! &nbsp;I’ll see you inside the course.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>Learn game development with Unreal Engine 5. UE5 is the <strong>industry-leading 3D game design software</strong> that the professionals use to create today’s top games. Start your journey towards getting paid to make video games today!<br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Learn Video Game Development with this Unreal Engine 5 Course for Beginners</strong></p><p>Begin your game development career with possibly the most up-to-date game dev course on the internet - Unreal Engine 5: The Complete Beginner’s Course. <strong>Unlike other courses, which remain static, this course is regularly updated so that it will always cover one of the most recent versions of Unreal Engine 5.</strong></p><p>When I began trying to learn Unreal Engine, I found a lot of information, but it was unstructured and lacked detail. So I created this course to provide what others lacked - structure and detail. The course is laid out very carefully so that you can go into it knowing absolutely nothing, and then, little by little, each lecture builds upon the previous lectures, so that every time you learn something new, you already have all the knowledge you need to learn that new thing without any confusion.</p><p>Unlike other courses, it <strong>covers the fundamentals in detail</strong>, so by the end you should have a thorough understanding of all the basics of Unreal Engine and be fully prepared to move on to more intermediate topics. Depending on your goals, this might not be for you. This course was designed for those who want to learn as much about Unreal Engine 5 as possible. If you’re just looking to have a bit of fun and to tinker around a little bit, then this might not be the right course for you. But, if you’re interested in getting really good, possibly becoming an indie developer or even working for a major studio, then I strongly believe that this is the best course for you to start with. This course will teach you the knowledge that normally falls through the cracks.</p><p>At the end of each section, there are a series of tutorial videos that provide an opportunity to apply the concepts learned in that section. These tutorials will <strong>walk you through the process of making a working game, from start-to-finish, step-by-step</strong>.</p><p>This course covers the fundamentals that other courses skip, causing you to get confused as you try to learn more advanced topics. The course will cover the following topics in thorough detail:</p><ul><li><p>Projects &amp; Levels</p></li><li><p>Actor Types</p></li><li><p>Meshes &amp; Brushes</p></li><li><p>Lighting</p></li><li><p>Materials</p></li><li><p>Characters &amp; Input</p></li><li><p>Collisions</p></li><li><p>Blueprint Logic &amp; Data</p></li><li><p>User Interfaces</p></li><li><p>Audio</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Develop Games Using Cutting-Edge Game Design Software</strong></p><p>The Unreal Engine has won the “Best Game Engine” award several times from various organizations, including the Develop Industry Excellence Awards and Game Developer Magazine. It is considered by many to be the most powerful real-time 3D creation tool.</p><p>The Unreal Engine has been used to develop many blockbuster games and game franchises including Fortnite, BioShock, Gears of Wars, Splinter Cell, Rainbow 6, Borderlands, Dishonored, Mass Effect, Batman: Arkham Asylum, and hundreds more.</p><p>For years, the Unreal Engine was only affordable for large companies, but now, Unreal Engine 5 is completely free to use, as long as you agree to pay Epic Games 5% of your game sales over $1 million.<br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Learn Unreal Engine 5 in this Video Game Design Course</strong></p><p>In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of game development using the Unreal Engine 5 through a series of 62 lectures and 15 tutorials. By the end of the course, you will have built an entire demo game from scratch.</p><p>The course will start from scratch and programming knowledge is not required, so anyone with basic computer skills can jump in and begin their Unreal Engine 5 training! For those who learn better with closed captions, <strong>100% of the captions are human transcribed</strong>, not auto-generated.</p><p>The first part of the course will help you get the Unreal Engine 5 up and running and will introduce you to the basic concepts of game development using the Engine. Next, you will learn all the skills you need to craft beautiful environments to stage your games in. Then, you will learn how to script logic for your games so you can define game rules and behaviors, keep track of data such as health and inventory, and create playable characters. You will learn about collisions and damage, key concepts for any action game. You will learn how to create user interfaces using the UMG Editor, so you can add things like menus, load screens, and HUDs to your game.&nbsp;And finally, you will learn how audio works within the Engine so you can add music, dialogue, and sound effects to your game.</p><p>Upon completion of the course, you will have the skills necessary to translate <em>ideas </em>for games into playable games that use environments you sculpt and logic that you define, and you will understand how to make a game in Unreal Engine 5.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Learn How to Make Video Games Using a State-of-the-Art 3D Game Engine</strong></p><p>Unreal Engine is powerful software that can be used for film &amp; tv, architecture, and product development, but this course is specifically designed for learning how to make video games with Unreal Engine. It can be used to make games for PC, mobile, and consoles, including PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo consoles. The engine continues to be updated with amazing new features, such as Lumen, Nanite, Virtual Shadow Maps, World Partition, and MegaLights. These features allow you to create games that can quickly render huge amounts of geometric detail inside giant, immersive worlds. Unreal Engine has everything you need to develop professional AAA games.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Learn Unreal Engine 5 C++ Programming by Creating an Action-RPG Style Open World Game!</p><p>This course will take you from beginner to hero as we create everything in this course project from scratch. Learn Unreal Engine 5's new features from <strong>Open World</strong> maps, <strong>Quixel Bridge</strong> megascans for ultra-realistic environments, landscape <strong>sculpting</strong> and <strong>painting</strong>, <strong>dungeons</strong>, free-roaming creatures and humanoids with various <strong>weapons</strong>, <strong>breakable objects</strong> that <strong>spawn treasure</strong>, and more!</p><p>Slay your way through your open world level, hacking and slashing creatures, breaking pots and collecting treasure and souls, and try to keep your health and stamina high! </p><p>We will implement enemy behavior that can be reused for various creature types, including gruntlings, raptors, insects, and golems. Code your character to be able to pick up and equip better and better weapons as she slays stronger and stronger monsters and collects loot.</p><p>We will cover new Unreal Engine 5 features such as <strong>Motion Warping</strong>, <strong>Meta Sounds</strong>, <strong>Linked Anim Graphs</strong>, UE5's new retargeting system with <strong>IK&nbsp;Rigs</strong> and<strong> IK&nbsp;Retargeters</strong>, <strong>Leg IK</strong>&nbsp;with <strong>Control Rigs</strong>, visual effect creation in <strong>Niagara</strong>, and more!</p><p>We'll start with a completely empty level and add everything from sky and atmosphere, nature, trees and plants, and we'll even import an entire dungeon level with the use of UE5's new <strong>Packed Level Instance</strong> feature.</p><p>We will cover <strong>vectors </strong>and game development <strong>mathematics </strong>in a full math section to prepare you for gameplay programming before diving in and creating our first C++&nbsp;class.</p><p>We will then learn Unreal Engine's class hierarchy, creating a basic <strong>Actor</strong>, learning about trigonometry as we use the <strong>sine </strong>function to give our items floating behavior.</p><p>We then create a Bird using the <strong>Pawn </strong>class so we can fly around our level and get a literal bird's-eye view.</p><p>We then create our <strong>Character </strong>class, using <strong>Echo </strong>from the Valley of the Ancient Epic-released free project, a beautiful and lifelike humanoid with <strong>cloth physics</strong> on her scarf and garments.</p><p>We implement <strong>weapon equipping</strong> and <strong>combat</strong>. We learn how to calculate <strong>directional hit reactions</strong>, using <strong>root motion animations</strong> to make our enemies stumble in the correct direction based on the direction of impact.</p><p>We give our enemies <strong>patrolling</strong> behavior, then chasing and <strong>attacking </strong>behavior. We make our enemies smarter with the use of UE5's new <strong>Motion Warping</strong> system, warping our enemy's location and rotation to make it hit the target more frequently, and making it harder to move out of harm's way.</p><p>We then give Echo a fighting chance, by implementing a <strong>dodge </strong>ability, similar to Dark Souls and Elden Ring. She can dodge out of the way while the enemy swings fervently, making them miss so we can move in to counter-attack.</p><p>We make <strong>breakable pots and vases</strong> using the <strong>Chaos destruction system</strong>, and these breakables <strong>spawn treasure</strong> when we break them, allowing us to collect loot and increment our <strong>gold</strong> count in the HUD.</p><p>We create a beautiful Soul effect in <strong>Niagara</strong>, and make enemies <strong>spawn souls</strong> upon death so we can gain <strong>experience points</strong>.</p><p>We learn how to make enemies stronger with an <strong>Attribute </strong>component, giving them varying levels of <strong>health </strong>and <strong>damage</strong>, and <strong>soul spawn counts</strong>.</p><p>We use UE5's new <strong>Animation Blueprint Templates </strong>to reuse all of our enemy code to create different types of enemies, from humanoids that wield weapons to creatures that bite, sting, and smash.</p><p>Get your RPG project started with this amazing course, which is the product of nearly a decade of professional Unreal Engine experience and teaching.</p><p>This course is in a whole new universe than the original UE4 version I created four years ago!&nbsp;Benefit from years of learning, teaching, and implementing Unreal's newly evolved system with its cutting-edge game creation capabilities!</p><p>This is my most well-taught course yet, and by far the most beautiful game project of all my courses on Udemy thus far.</p><p>Join me and let's have a ton of fun creating the start of an action RPG&nbsp;hack-and-slash Open World game in <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong>! </p>",

In this game we are going to help Jack climb down the beanstalk, along the way we can jump on white clouds but we need to avoid dark clouds. Besides of creating our gameplay we are going to create menus, implement background music, implement admob ads and much much more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The next game that we are going to create is Flappy Bird, and I know what you are thinking oh not another Flappy Bird clone, but this is not a regular Flappy Bird clone, oh no, I've added a lot of features that you can't find in any other flappy bird clone such as selecting a bird(choose between different flappy birds), implementing tweeter and many other features that you will see inside of the course.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After Flappy Bird we are going to create one of the most popular games out there - Infinite Runner!! In this game we are going to see how can we implement features such as quads to represent our backgrounds, spawning obstacles and destroying them, recycling obstacles, implementing google play game services and much much more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Next game that we are going to create is going to be a 2D Plaformer game that I call Spider Cave. In this game our player is able to fly and he needs to collect diamonds in order to exit out of the level, what he needs to avoid though are the spiders that lure inside the cave. We are going to have a spider shooter who shoots our player, spider jumper who tries to eat our player when the player is above him and spider walker who simply walks left and right. For the first time we are going to implement simple AI(Artificial Intelligence) in our games, and you can use these techniques in your own games that you will create!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After our spider cave we are going to create a nice puzzle game, which a kids game. In this game we are going to implement a lot of features such as creating the whole game in one single scene!! We are going to see how can we compare images to each other in order to check if we have a correct guess, we are going to use the mechanim system a lot in this game in order to animate our menus, that and much more awaits you in this lecture.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The final game that we are going to create is a game that is called Ball Panic. This is the largest game that we are going to create in this course and the game covers a lot of topics everybody is interested in, such as creating a level and character lock/unlock system, creating weapons menu in order to select a weapon for our player, creating level menu and unlocking those levels, implementing video and interstitial ads and in app purchase, that and much more awaits you in this lecture.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What You will learn</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Unity Interface</strong></li><li><strong>Basic C# Programming</strong></li><li><strong>Intermediate C# Programming</strong></li><li><strong>Advanced C# Programming</strong></li><li><strong>Importing And Organizing Assets</strong></li><li><strong>Slicing Sprites</strong></li><li><strong>Animating Sprites</strong></li><li><strong>Learn How To Use Unitys New UI System</strong></li><li><strong>Creating Menus</strong></li><li><strong>Creating Loading Screen</strong></li><li><strong>Creating Cool Animations</strong></li><li><strong>Understand And Use Unitys Physics System</strong></li><li><strong>Saving Game Data Using Binary Input/Output</strong></li><li><strong>Creating Character And Level Select Menu</strong></li><li><strong>Creating Character And Level Lock Unlock System</strong></li><li><strong>Using Game Controllers To Control The Workflow Of Your Game</strong></li><li><strong>Play Music In Your Game</strong></li><li><strong>Create In-App Purchase To Sell Virtual Items To Your User</strong></li><li><strong>Implement Social Media In Your Game(Facebook and Tweeter)</strong></li><li><strong>Share On Facebook From Your Game</strong></li><li><strong>Create Share On Facebook Earn Virtual Item System In Your Game</strong></li><li><strong>Implement Interstitial Ads</strong></li><li><strong>Implement Video Ads</strong></li><li><strong>Create A Watch Video Earn Virtual Item System In Your Game</strong></li><li><strong>Implement Google Leaderboards And Achievements In Your Game</strong></li><li><strong>Learn How To Support Multiple Screen Resolutions</strong></li><li><strong>Learn How To Submit Your Game On Google Play Store</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>That And Much More Is Awaiting You In This Course</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What this course DOES NOT cover :</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The course teaches everything from basic to more advanced stuff on how to plan, design, develop and publish your game, however the course WILL NOT teach you every single aspect of Unity and how to use it because it's impossible to teach everything. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Using what you obtain in this course, you will be equipped with more than enough knowledge in order to continue improving yourself in the field of game development, using Unity or any other game engine.<br></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If You ever had an idea for an awesome game, then enroll in this course and learn the tools that you need to develop Your next hit game!!!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Is Your Risk  By Taking This Course?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nothing!!

  "description": "<p>2025 update: This is now the <strong>most sold Minecraft course ever!</strong> (Course updated August 2025) <br><em>Our Discord server has 5,000+ students! You'll enjoy 24/7 support and a warm community to learn alongside.</em> <br><br>You'll learn how to create Minecraft plugins, from any level to advanced. The first tutorial is the installation and setup, and we'll work together by starting simple and turning you into some sort of Java god! We'll start with setting up your first plugin, creating commands and listening to events, and then move onto more tricky aspects, such as GUIs, packets and schedulers (and literally everything in between - scroll down to see the list of videos!). We also have full sections on making a minigame, building a network, managing databases and understanding NMS/packets.</p><p>Whether you know Java or not, you'll learn it from this course. I'll be covering Java from basic to advanced throughout the course and this is a skill that you can carry all throughout life. When using it with Minecraft, you can create some beautiful things: for example, you could be developing your own server, doing private commissions or even sell your plugins on marketplaces for people to purchase. At the end of this carefully constructed course you will be confident in creating plugins for Paper, Spigot, Bukkit &amp; Bungee servers.</p><p>It's now 2025. I first released this course in 2017, and it has since seen several complete remakes! I've been writing Minecraft plugins for around a decade now, and we have built an exceptional exclusive community of thousands of like-minded developers who offer around the clock support in a welcoming, judgement-free environment.</p><p>If you decide to join us, you're in safe hands. We hope to see you soon! </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why this course?</strong> </p><p>• 130+ lectures <br>•<strong> 4000+ 5 star reviews (and 15,000+ students!)<br></strong>• Very generous price and still the best available<br>• Discord server with 5000+ members &amp; dozens of support staff (who would love to help!) <br>• <strong>Constantly being updated to suit API changes </strong>(covers all versions)<br>• 'Best selling' course by Udemy (quality reviewed by a human) <br>• Very high course rating! (average for video game category is 4.2) <br>• 24/7 Q&amp;A section (every question answered) <br>• One purchase = lifetime access (content is always being added)<br>• Extra resources after each lecture for further learning<br>• Videos for both Windows and Mac users<br>• 1080p 60fps HD videos <br>• English captions <br>• Partnered with JetBrains!

  "description": "<p><strong>Now Updated for Unity 2017 to Unity 6!</strong></p><p>This course presents a comprehensive&nbsp;guide&nbsp;to programming with Cg&nbsp;and High Level Shader Language in Unity's Shaderlab,&nbsp;to create your own visual surface effects&nbsp;for colouring and lighting game objects. It covers the mathematics of light and surfaces and steps you through the recreation of some of the most popular shaders. Many computer graphics concepts will be presented to help you understand the graphics pipeline and provide you with an essential toolkit of rendering knowledge, that will have you developing your own transparent, animated and texturised shaders in no time.</p><p>In this course, Penny teaches all the invaluable skills you will require to program the computer graphics pipeline in Unity&nbsp;from scratch using her internationally acclaimed teaching style and&nbsp;knowledge from over 25 years working with games and graphics. &nbsp;But hold on tight as you'll be taken on a journey across the computer graphics realm as it is taught to post-graduate university students. Through detailed descriptions and hands-on workshops examining all you need to know about rendering queues, vector mathematics, graphics buffers, colour theory, 3D meshes, texture mapping, lighting models and much more.<br></p><p><strong>Learn how to program and work with:</strong></p><ul><li><p>variables and packed arrays</p></li><li><p>meshes, vertices and UVs</p></li><li><p>the mathematics for working with objects in 3D and 2D spaces</p></li><li><p>a variety of lighting models from creating flat shaded objects to highly reflective shiny surfaces</p></li><li><p>bump maps for adding extra depth and dimension to surface textures</p></li><li><p>special effects such as holographic, scrolling textures and surface deformations</p></li><li><p>the variety of graphics buffers used in the rendering pipeline</p></li><li><p>forward and deferred lighting</p></li><li><p>surface, vertex and fragment shaders written in CG/HLSL</p></li><li><p>volumetric rendering</p></li></ul><p><strong>Contents and Overview</strong></p><p>After diving right in and creating your very first shader from scratch, we will begin the lessons by examining how 3D models are structured and how that is used within shader code to colour and display the surface in computer graphics. You'll discover all the properties of a shader and how they can be controlled in code and via values fed in through Unity's Inspector.</p><p>Following this, we will examine a variety of lighting models and how lights and surface textures can influence the final look of a render. Included here, an overview of the buffers involved in the rendering queue will be given with practical examples for creating special effects that require more than one draw call. Students will also&nbsp;be exposed to the power of vector mathematics and especially the dot product and its role in creating beautiful effects such as outlines, rim lighting and holograms.&nbsp;In addition, issues surrounding transparency and blending will be discussed along with many practical hands-on workshops in which students can flex their newfound skills to interrogate the code they write for better understanding.</p><p>The next section brings together all the skills learned throughout together, to develop some of the more popular complex shaders including animated plasma and animated water with waves.</p><p>Finally volumetric shaders are covered in which you will follow along to create special effects such as fake geometry, fog and clouds.</p><p><strong>What students are saying about this course:</strong></p><ul><li><p>This is the best course I've ever taken. It is perfect for me. I worked for 15 years in feature animation. A large part of my career was spent developing shaders for a proprietary renderer. This course has already helped me to bring the value of my previous experience into Unity.</p></li><li><p>Best shader course I've come across. There are enough and more tutorials on youtube to teach you how to develop your own shaders, but nothing falls into the class of Penny's tutorials. They are clear and to the point. Really happy about this one.</p></li><li><p>Wow! Thank you so much! If there were 10 stars - this course would deserve it. Going from absolutely knowing nothing about Shader writing to have a profund understanding about it.</p></li><li><p>I wanted to let you know that I just finished your shader course and thought it was fantastic. It was a pleasure to take the course and finally get a grasp on a topic that seemed so foreign to me not so long ago. Your teaching style and personality really worked for me and made learning a breeze!</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p><strong>This is the Ultimate Blueprint course for Unreal Engine 5.</strong></p><p>In this course, you will start with absolutely no experience in game development whatsoever. All of the important terms and concepts in game development will be introduced to you and explained carefully and in detail. By the end, you will have four small game projects of different genres, ranging from 2D to 3D, and you'll understand the underlying principles needed to make any creation you can imagine.</p><p>The course starts you off as a complete beginner, but <strong>experienced developers will also benefit from this course</strong>, as many best practices and advanced features are covered throughout.</p><p>The course begins at the beginning - downloading the Epic Games Launcher, where we will install Unreal Engine 5, as well as gain access to the Epic Games Marketplace where we can get tons of free, high-quality assets for our games. After familiarizing ourselves with the Unreal Engine editor, learning about asset types and how to import asset files, we get some practice manipulating objects in the level and building simple game environments with free asset packs.</p><p>We then get started learning the basic structure of the Blueprint visual scripting system, as well as cover the fundamental math skills every game developer needs to understand. We get practice visualizing vectors in the engine with the various debug drawing Blueprint nodes.</p><p>With the original assets created specifically for this course, we then create our first simple game, Bad Bot - a drone flying shooter. We cover the fundamentals of Unreal Engine's class hierarchy, learning about the various game classes that come together to form a basic game - including the <strong>Actor</strong>, the <strong>Pawn</strong>, the <strong>Game Mode</strong>, and the <strong>Controller</strong>. We learn how to bind inputs from keyboard, mouse, and console controller using Unreal Engine's <strong>Enhanced Input System</strong>. This project covers spawning enemy bots, firing projectiles, and adding sound and visual effects such as impacts and explosions, before finishing the level with a <strong>boss fight</strong>.</p><p>We then dive deep into Unreal Engine's <strong>collision framework</strong>, with a section dedicated to the collision system in Unreal Engine. We learn how Unreal Engine handles collision, including knowledge of:</p><ul><li><p>The physics system versus the query system</p></li><li><p>Collision Complexity and how meshes can have both simple and complex collision and how to configure these</p></li><li><p>How the method of movement determines the type of interactions objects will have with each other</p></li><li><p>Sweeping collisions versus physics collisions</p></li><li><p>Collision Enabled, Collision Object Types, and Collision Responses, and how these work together</p></li><li><p>Custom collision channels, custom collision profiles, and optimization for performance</p></li></ul><p>By the end of this chapter, Unreal Engine's collision framework will be completely demystified and you'll easily be able to configure the collision settings correctly so that your game object interact as intended, optimized for performance, and without invisible collision interactions affecting the game's frame rate.</p><p>With our newly-acquired collision skillset, we start the second game project of the course, Jetpack Journey - a third-person platformer with Kix, an original character created, rigged, and animated for this course. Kix has a jetpack, allowing us to step up our complexity, going from the Pawn class to the <strong>Character</strong> class. We learn about the Character Movement Component, and how to change movement modes from walking to flying. We implement a fully-functional jetpack with a blendspace, allowing for smooth blending of animations while flying. This project involves creating precious resources in the form of jet fuel, allowing us to implement pickups to refuel, a progress bar for the fuel percent, and moving platforms that force the player to use the flying capability. We learn about some very important concepts in this section, including:</p><ul><li><p>Movement modes, and switching to flying mode</p></li><li><p>Single and two-dimensional Blendspaces to blend between animation poses</p></li><li><p>Binding inputs in the Player Controller versus the Character class</p></li><li><p>Keeping Blueprint nodes clean and readable</p></li><li><p>Managing class dependencies and coding best practices - we're using Blueprints, but we should still follow best practice!</p></li><li><p>Skeletal Mesh Sockets, utilized for jetpack thruster effects</p></li><li><p>Enforcing precious resources in the form of jet fuel, with jet fuel pickups to refill fuel</p></li><li><p>Use of UMG (Unreal Motion Graphics) to create UI including a progress bar to display fuel percent</p></li><li><p>The impact of Casting on runtime performance and memory via the creation of hard references</p></li><li><p>Analyzing class memory size via the size map, and dependencies via the reference viewer</p></li><li><p>Reducing file size with texture compression</p></li><li><p>Lazily loading of assets at runtime and how to load assets asynchronously, using soft object and class references</p></li><li><p>Lighting and Post Processing</p></li></ul><p>This section covers many important aspects of game development that even experienced developers aren't aware of. You're verging on intermediate-to-advanced territory with some of these!</p><p>The next game project introduces Unreal Engine's 2D capabilities, as we enable the built-in Paper2D plugin for 2D games. We also download the now-free PaperZD, a very important 2D plugin allowing us to use important 2D features for our games. This section's game project is a 2D dungeon-crawling side-scroller with Red Hood, a hooded 2D figure who ventures through a dark dungeon, battling skeleton minions via melee combat. We cover some valuable ground in this section, including:</p><ul><li><p>Where to get free 2D assets, including animated characters, props, UI and environments</p></li><li><p>Creation of sprites, flipbooks, tile sets and tile maps</p></li><li><p>Important settings for a 2D Unreal Engine game project</p></li><li><p>2D level creation</p></li><li><p>Enemy AI with the Behavior Tree and Blackboard</p></li><li><p>Combat and <strong>combo attacks</strong></p></li><li><p>Use and creation of the compound data types such as enums and structures</p></li><li><p>Floating damage numbers</p></li><li><p>Implementing melee combat</p></li></ul><p>By this point, you will have the skills necessary to create your own game projects, but we're not quite done yet. We wrap up the course with a final section on Unreal Engine's Chaos Vehicles! Chaos Vehicles are Unreal's physics-based vehicle system. We use original assets created specifically for this course, importing a sci-fi car and wheels into the engine. We use the engine's built-in rigging tools to create a skeleton and skin it to the mesh, before creating a fully-functional chaos vehicle. We end by implementing enter/leave functionality for the car, by migrating the vehicle into our Jetpack Journey project so Kix can enter and leave the vehicle. We learn:</p><ul><li><p>Creation of Skeletal Meshes from Static Meshes</p></li><li><p>Rigging and skinning, creating a vehicle skeleton and physics asset</p></li><li><p>Creation of a fully-functional chaos vehicle with keyboard/mouse and console controller input (using Enhanced Input)</p></li><li><p>Coverage of Chaos Vehicle settings including torque/rpms, friction, front/rear/all-wheel drive, front/rear wheel steering, and more</p></li><li><p>Migrating the vehicle into our Jetpack project</p></li><li><p>Changing possession of Pawns/Characters to enter and exit the vehicle.</p></li></ul><p>By the end of this course, you will have gone from absolute beginner to having intermediate/advanced skills. You will understand the principles necessary to create game projects on your own. You will have hands-on practice, as well as theoretical knowledge underlying every tool and concept used throughout this course.</p><p>You will also have access to our Druid Mechanics Discord Community, a community of over 23,000 students of all skill levels, all interacting, conversing, and helping each other throughout their game development journeys.</p><p>After this course, you will fully understand Unreal Engine's architecture and class hierarchy. If your aim is to develop your own games, or even to further your career or learning journey, or move on to tackle Unreal's C++ system, this course will prepare you and equip you with the skills needed to do so.</p><p>You will gain lifetime access to the course for a single, one-time fee. You will have access to all updates and patches made to the videos.</p><p>If you're ready to learn how to make your own games, this course is ready for you.</p><p>See you soon!</p>",

  "description": "<p>This is the most comprehensive Unreal Engine course available. If you want to learn how to architect a fully-functional RPG&nbsp;game, this course will give you the ability to do so with an expandable code base, architected with AAA quality code. If you've ever wondered where to draw the line between C++&nbsp;and Blueprints, this is the course for you. If you've ever wanted to create an RPG complete with a stats system, abilities, leveling up, spells, attributes, menus, all while keeping your code base clean and following best practices, this is the course for you. If you want to step up your Unreal Engine development capabilities and better understand the inner workings of the engine, this course is for you. If you have plans to make your own serious game with interconnecting systems, involving attributes, abilities, level ups, enemies and AI, and coded for multiplayer, this is the course for you!</p><p>In this course, we will create a top-down RPG&nbsp;style game, filled with systems architected using Unreal Engine's built-in Gameplay Ability System&nbsp;(GAS). This is where you will learn how to architect a shipped game, and code it expertly so it can be easily expanded, upgraded, and maintained. We follow SOLID&nbsp;coding principles, and balance the Blueprint/C++&nbsp;ratio in a way that AAA&nbsp;shipped games do, such as Fortnite. My experience with AAA&nbsp;shipped game code, as well as consultations with industry veteran developers has allowed me to reveal to you the way a real shipped game's code base looks like. If you've ever wondered how much of a game can be kept in Blueprint versus C++, look no further. This course is the answer.</p><p>NOTE:&nbsp;This course involves programming in C++, which involves the use of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio, Rider, or VSCode. The IDE&nbsp;used in this course by me will be Rider, but this IDE&nbsp;is <strong>not</strong> a requirement for students to follow the course. You can use any IDE&nbsp;of your choice.</p><p>The assets in this game project were made specifically for this course, and will be provided in an asset pack. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>Characters, including Aura, the main character, as well as enemy characters including Goblin Warriors, Goblin Rangers, a Goblin Shaman, Red and Black Demons, the Ghoul, and a Shroom.</p></li><li><p>A modular dungeon pack that can be pieced together to make basic dungeons</p></li><li><p>A&nbsp;waypoint shrine and obelisks</p></li><li><p>Particle Niagara System Effects, including explosions, level up effects, slingshot rocks, hit impacts, electricity beams, fireballs, fire bolts, flames, stars for stun effects, and more!</p></li><li><p>Sound effects for enemies, footsteps, spells, and more!</p></li><li><p>Textures for the HUD, including high-quality buttons, frames, dynamically-animated spell globes, progress bars, XP&nbsp;bar, and more!</p></li><li><p>Full animation sets for Aura and all enemies</p></li><li><p>Much more!</p></li></ul><p>In this course, we will be covering the following topics:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Setting up a Top-Down Project from scratch</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Enemy and item selection</strong> with outline effects</p></li><li><p>Proper use of <strong>OOP</strong> and <strong>inheritance </strong>to create a character class hierarchy</p></li><li><p>Intro to the <strong>Gameplay Ability System</strong> and the core classes that comprise it</p></li><li><p><strong>Custom Gameplay Ability System Components</strong> and <strong>Attribute Sets</strong>, and how to replicate Attributes</p></li><li><p>All important settings for all GAS&nbsp;classes and components</p></li><li><p>How to use Attributes for <strong>player stats</strong>, including <strong>Primary Attributes</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Strength (increases physical damage)</p></li><li><p>Intelligence (increases magical damage)</p></li><li><p>Resilience (increases Armor and Armor Penetration)</p></li><li><p>Vigor (increases Max Health)</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Secondary Attributes</strong>, based off of primary attributes and other custom variables:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Armor </strong>(reduces damage taken, improves Block Chance)</p></li><li><p><strong>Armor Penetration </strong>(ignores percentage of enemy Armor, increases Critical Hit Chance)</p></li><li><p><strong>Block Chance</strong> (change to cut incoming damage in half)</p></li><li><p><strong>Critical Hit Chance</strong> (chance to double damage plus critical hit bonus)</p></li><li><p><strong>Critical Hit Damage</strong> (bonus damage added when a critical hit is scored)</p></li><li><p><strong>Critical Hit Resistance</strong> (reduces critical hit chance of attacking enemies)</p></li><li><p><strong>Health Regeneration</strong> (amount of Health restored every 1 second)</p></li><li><p><strong>Mana Regeneration</strong> (amount of Mana restored every 1 second)</p></li><li><p><strong>Max Health</strong> (maximum amount of Health obtainable)</p></li><li><p><strong>Max Mana</strong> (maximum amount of Mana obtainable)</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Vital Attributes</strong> - things like <strong>Health </strong>and <strong>Mana</strong>, which are dependent on all the other attributes</p></li><li><p><strong>Gameplay Effects</strong> - classes in the GAS&nbsp;system used to apply changes to attributes</p></li><li><p><strong>Gameplay Tags</strong> - an essential part of GAS, which allows us to identify qualities, attributes, abilities, character classes, and any other thing we can imagine</p></li><li><p><strong>Game UI</strong> - how to handle complex UI&nbsp;in an RPG&nbsp;game efficiently, in an organized, modular, and scalable manner. We cover different UI&nbsp;paradigms, from <strong>MVC</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>Model View Controller</strong>) and <strong>MVVM&nbsp;</strong>(<strong>Model View ViewModel</strong>, using Unreal Engine's new <strong>ViewModel </strong>feature)</p></li><li><p>Full <strong>Attribute </strong>and <strong>Spell Menus</strong>, with upgrade abilities, spell trees, locked spell levels, spell upgrades by ability level, and more</p></li><li><p><strong>Attributes </strong>- how to use Gameplay Attributes to represent player stats, and incorporate them into the gameplay mechanics by creating an Effect Application pipeline, allowing for calculations and results caused by phenomena in the game, such as combat damage</p></li><li><p><strong>Gameplay Abilities</strong> - the heart of GAS. We create all manner of types of gameplay abilities to handle the casting of spells, handling important capabilities of the player character and enemy AI, and how to configure different abilities to suit your needs. </p></li><li><p><strong>Different RPG&nbsp;Classes</strong> - we implement different character RPG&nbsp;classes including the Ranger, Warrior, and Elementalist, and do so in an easily-scalable manner so you can have any number of character class types in your game</p></li><li><p><strong>Damage </strong>and <strong>Combat </strong>- we implement a full RPG&nbsp;style combat system with different damage types, damage resistances, and debuffs corresponding to damage types, and encode these calculations into our damage pipeline. All attributes, damage types, resistances and debuffs are functional in this game. </p></li><li><p>All combat mechanics are displayed in some form of <strong>visual feedback</strong> to the player. This includes <strong>floating text for damage</strong>, changing color based on custom criteria, floating text to inform of <strong>critical hits</strong>, <strong>blocked hits</strong>, and <strong>critical blocked hits</strong>. We also implement <strong>knockback </strong>and <strong>stun </strong>mechanics in response to lightning damage, incapacitating the character/enemy, as well as <strong>fire debuffs</strong>, where characters are set ablaze and take fire damage while <strong>burning</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enemy AI</strong>&nbsp;- We implement the enemy behavior using Unreal Engine <strong>Behavior Trees</strong> and the <strong>Environment Query system (EQS)</strong> to provide customized behavior for the Ranged, Warrior, and Elementalist enemy types. </p></li><li><p><strong>Enemies can cast spells and summon AI&nbsp;minions</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Fading geometry</strong> when it gets in the way of the camera for a top-down game</p></li><li><p><strong>Ability Cost</strong> and <strong>Cooldown</strong> (spells spend Attribute resources - in this game, spells cost <strong>Mana</strong>)</p></li><li><p><strong>Fully functional HUD with Equipped Spells</strong>, displaying spell <strong>cooldown timers</strong>, and experience (<strong>XP</strong>)</p></li><li><p>The ability to <strong>assign Abilities to different inputs</strong> in the spell menu (assign FireBolt to the 1 key and Electrocute to the Left Mouse Button, swap them back, etc.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Experience and Level-Up System</strong> - We craft an experience system, awarding XP&nbsp;for eliminating enemies, and leveling up when reaching XP&nbsp;thresholds for various abilities. XP&nbsp;and Level are displayed in the HUD, and Level Up messages and effects are as well. Leveling up is associated with gaining Attribute Points and Spell Points, which can be used to upgrade Attributes and Spell abilities in the Attribute and Spell Menus respectively, as well as topping off Health and Mana upon Leveling Up. (<strong>Basically, you will see enough examples of how to use this system that you'll be able to expand it with any functionality you want for your own games</strong>)</p></li><li><p><strong>Passive Spells</strong> - Spells that you can equip which <strong>remain active </strong>while they are equipped.</p></li><li><p>A variety of <strong>Offensive Spells</strong>, showcasing different examples and features of GAS, including FireBolt, Electrocute, Arcane Shards, and FireBlast.</p></li><li><p><strong>Saving Progress</strong> and <strong>Level Transitions</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Intermediate/Advanced Unreal Engine topics</strong>, including custom Async Tasks, Ability Tasks, Blueprint Function Libraries, Asset Managers, Singletons (and why these are only good for a VERY&nbsp;select few cases), custom Gameplay Effect Contexts, Net&nbsp;Serialization, Struct Ops Type Traits, C++&nbsp;Lambdas, game mechanics algorithms, and oh, so much more.</p></li><li><p><strong>How to choose which functionality should go into C++&nbsp;versus Blueprint</strong> - This is one of the most valuable lessons, and is taught all throughout the course. Students often ask me \"which functionality should go in C++&nbsp;versus in Blueprint?\"&nbsp;This course is my answer. This is a serious-scale project foundation with over 100 hours of video, and <strong>no filler</strong>. The project is architected with approximately <strong>50%&nbsp;Blueprints and 50%&nbsp;C++</strong>. I&nbsp;show you which functionality should be on the C++&nbsp;side, which functionality is more appropriate for Blueprints, and why. </p></li><li><p><strong>SOLID&nbsp;Coding Principles and code architecture</strong> - We keep our code base clean in this project. Another question I&nbsp;often get is \"<strong>Is this best coding practice?</strong>\" This course is my answer to this question. This is an example of code you would see in a AAA&nbsp;game, shipped to millions of players. Maintaining clean and modular code is essential to a serious game project that needs to be scalable, expandable, modular, maintainable, testable, performant, and efficient. This course will show you how.</p></li></ul><p>This is not a beginner course. I&nbsp;expect you to already understand the C++&nbsp;programming language and have at least created one Unreal Engine C++&nbsp;project.</p><p>This course is my best course yet, and I'm very proud to bring you the <strong>Unreal Engine 5 - Gameplay Ability System - Top Down RPG</strong> course, the result of nearly a year of painstaking development, research, consultation with professionals, and asset creation. After taking this course, you will understand Unreal Engine far better than the average developer, and you'll be empowered to create your own well-architected projects, large and small, and you'll bring value to your team, your company, your solo venture, and anyone/anything else you grace with your skillset.</p><p>Join the course, and invest in the biggest leap of your game development career.</p><p>Stephen Ulibarri, founder of the Druid Mechanics Game Developer Community <br><br><strong>This course project is created in Unreal Engine version 5.2. Updates are periodically added to ensure compatibility with newer engine versions. </strong></p>",

You'll also learn about project settings we need to adjust and about the enhanced input action system which we'll use throughout all of the other chapters in this course as well.</p><p>The second game will teach you all about using sprite sheets and how we can create flipbooks.</p><p><br>We'll also look at how to switch between the idle and run flipbook during gameplay and how to play footstep sounds on the correct animation frames.</p><p><br>Since we want the background to be dynamically adjustable I'll also teach you how we can use a background sprite in a blueprint, attach collisions to them and dynamically change them in the construction script depending on how long we want the stage to be.</p><p>The Third game is a classic platformer game and will be the first projects using the free PaperZD plugin to improve the workflow of making 2D games with Unreal Engine.</p><p>Here you'll learn how to set up an animation source and animation blueprint file with PaperZD and use them to create animation graphs and animation notifies.<br>We'll also create enemies that can detect walls and ledges to change the direction they walk in and can interact with the player when being stomped on or touching the player character.</p><p><br>You'll also learn how to create a one-way platform that we can jump through form the bottom, but don't fall through from the top.</p><p>The forth game will combine all the things we've learned and will be the first 2D/3D hybrid game we create.</p><p><br>This means that our characters are 2D pixel art, however the backgrounds are 3D environments which allow us to make use of all of the amazing features of Unreal Engine.</p><p><br>For this game we don't only have platformer mechanics, but we'll also implement hitboxes, a stun system a damage system and many more things you'll need to know about for most of your games.</p><p><br></p><p>To lean into metroidvania mechanics we also create an unlockable sword throw ability, which allows you to stick swords into the wall and use them as platforms to reach higher areas.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Do your non-player characters (NPCs) lack drive and ambition? &nbsp;Are they slow, stupid and constantly&nbsp;banging their heads against the wall? Then this course is for you. &nbsp;Join Penny as she&nbsp;explains, demonstrates and assists you in&nbsp;creating your very&nbsp;own NPCs in Unity with C#.&nbsp;All you need is a sound knowledge of Unity,&nbsp;C# and the ability to add two numbers together.</p><p>This course uses <strong>Unity Version 2021.3 LTS </strong>but all project has been tested and work in <strong>Unity 6.</strong></p><p>In this course, Penny reveals the most popular AI techniques used for creating believable character behaviour in games&nbsp;using her internationally acclaimed teaching style and&nbsp;knowledge from over 30 years working with games,&nbsp;graphics and having written two award winning books on games AI.&nbsp;Throughout, you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to teach you&nbsp;about the fundamental&nbsp;AI techniques used in today's&nbsp;games. &nbsp;You'll join in as NPCs are programmed to chase, patrol, shoot, race, crowd and much more.</p><p><strong>Learn how to program and work with:</strong></p><ul><li><p>vectors</p></li><li><p>waypoints</p></li><li><p>navmeshes</p></li><li><p>the A* algorithm</p></li><li><p>crowds</p></li><li><p>flocks</p></li><li><p>animated characters</p></li><li><p>vehicles</p></li><li><p>and industry standard techniques such as <strong><em>goal-oriented action learning</em></strong> and <strong><em>behaviour trees</em></strong>.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Contents and Overview</strong></p><p>The course begins with a detailed examination of vector mathematics that sits at the very heart of programming the movement of NPCs. Following this, systems of waypoints will be used to move characters around in an environment before examining the Unity waypoint system for car racing with AI controlled cars. &nbsp;This leads into an investigation of graph theory and the A* algorithm before we apply these principles to developing navmeshes and developing NPCs who can find their way around a game environment. &nbsp;Before an aquarium is programmed complete with autonomous schooling fish, crowds of people will be examined from the recreation of sidewalk traffic, to groups of people fleeing from danger. Having examined the differing ways to move NPCs around in a game environment, their thinking abilities will be discussed with full explanations and more hands-on workshops using finite state machines and behaviour trees.</p><p>The follow-along workshops included in the course come with starter Unity asset files and projects complete with&nbsp;solutions. &nbsp;Throughout, there are also quizzes and&nbsp;challenge exercises&nbsp;to reinforce your learning and guide you to express your newfound knowledge.</p><p>At the completion of this course you will have gained a broad understanding of what AI is in games, how it works and how you can use it in your own projects. &nbsp;It will equip you with a toolset to examine any of the techniques presented in more depth to take your game environments to the next level.</p><p><strong>What students are saying about this course:</strong></p><ul><li><p>This has been my favourite Udemy-Unity course so far. It took me from literally 0% knowledge of how game AI is achieved, and took me to a whole new level. Waypoints, pathfinding, state machines, etc etc etc are all covered in-depth and will reveal the magic (spoiler alert: it isn't magic) behind making your computer characters seem like they really have a mind of their own.</p></li><li><p>Oh My God. I love her way of teaching things. I haven’t finished this course yet. But all i can say is that it is another brilliant course from her. Artificial intelligence by itself is a tricky thing to do. And before starting this course i never thought that i will understand anything in it. But i was wrong. With her style of teaching, you will learn how to move your characters in an ”intelligent“ way. This course is perfectly sliced and the pace is wonderful.</p></li></ul>",

In addition to covering essential programming concepts such as structs and functions, you'll <strong>learn to animate 2D characters</strong> and make your game pretty.</p><p>In Classy Clash we introduce Object Oriented Programming. You'll learn how this simplifies programming for games and how inheritance can avoid code duplication.</p><p>Whether you're a total beginner to programming and want to learn pure C++, or an intermediate Unreal student who wants to explore making games in pure C++, this is the course for you!</p><p>There are no course prerequisites, though it'll help if you're comfortable installing new software and <strong>excited to learn programming</strong>!</p><p>All students have access to the Q&amp;A forums where our Instructors, Teaching Assistants and Community are ready to help answer your questions and cheer on your success. </p>",

  "description": "<p>What if you could build a character that could learn while it played? &nbsp;Think about the types of gameplay you could develop where the enemies started to outsmart the player. This is what machine learning in games is all about. In this course, we will discover the fascinating world of artificial intelligence beyond the simple stuff and examine the increasingly popular domain of machines that learn to think for themselves.</p><p>In this course, Penny introduces the popular machine learning&nbsp;techniques of genetic algorithms and neural networks&nbsp;using her internationally acclaimed teaching style and&nbsp;knowledge from a Ph.D in game character AI and&nbsp;over 25 years experience&nbsp;working with games and computer&nbsp;graphics. &nbsp;In addition she's&nbsp;written two award winning books on games AI and two others best sellers on Unity game development.&nbsp;Throughout the course&nbsp;you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to teach you&nbsp;about the fundamental machine learning&nbsp;techniques, distilling the mathematics in a way that the topic becomes accessible to the most noob of novices. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Learn how to program and work with:</strong></p><ul><li><p>genetic algorithms</p></li><li><p>neural networks</p></li><li><p>human player captured training sets</p></li><li><p>reinforcement learning</p></li><li><p>Unity's ML-Agent plugin</p></li><li><p>Tensorflow</p></li></ul><p><strong>Contents and Overview</strong></p><p>The course starts with a thorough examination of genetic algorithms that will ease you into one of the simplest machine learning techniques that is capable of extraordinary learning. You'll develop an agent that learns to camouflage, a Flappy Bird inspired application in which the birds learn to make it through a maze and environment-sensing bots that learn to stay on a platform.</p><p>Following this, you'll dive right into creating your very own neural network in C# from scratch. &nbsp;With this basic neural network, you will find out how to train behaviour, capture and use human player data to train an agent and teach a bot to drive. &nbsp;In the same section you'll have the Q-learning algorithm explained, before integrating it into your own applications.</p><p>By this stage, you'll feel confident with the terminology and techniques used throughout the deep learning community and be ready to tackle Unity's experimental&nbsp;ML-Agents. Together with Tensorflow, you'll be throwing agents in the deep-end and reinforcing their knowledge to stay alive in a variety of game environment scenarios.</p><p>By the end of the course, you'll have a well-equipped toolset of basic and solid machine learning algorithms and applications, that will see you able to decipher the latest research publications and integrate the latest developments into your work, while keeping abreast of Unity's ML-Agents as they evolve from experimental to production release.</p><p><strong>What students are saying about this course:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Absolutely the best beginner to Advanced course for Neural Networks/ Machine Learning if you are a game developer that uses C# and Unity. BAR NONE x Infinity.</p></li><li><p>A perfect course with great math examples and demonstration of the TensorFlow power inside Unity. After this course, you will get the strong basic background in the Machine Learning.</p></li><li><p>The instructor is very engaging and knowledgeable. I started learning from the first lesson and it never stopped. If you are interested in Machine Learning , take this course.</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>The Beginner's Guide to Animation in Unity with Mecanim is for&nbsp;animators and Unity practitioners&nbsp;who want to bring their characters to life in a game environment and&nbsp;want to learn the ins and outs of&nbsp;the mecanim system. You don't need to be able to model or&nbsp;animate in external packages as all models and animations are provided.&nbsp;All aspects of animation in Unity are&nbsp;covered from physics, key framing, curves, forward and inverse kinematics, animation state machines and working with third party assets. Students will be introduced to elementary&nbsp;code, in C#, that is essential&nbsp;for making dynamic animations and triggers to control character behaviour at run time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In this course, Penny teaches all the invaluable skills you will require to begin animating your own game characters&nbsp;in Unity&nbsp;using her internationally acclaimed teaching style and&nbsp;knowledge from over 25 years working with games and computer&nbsp;graphics.<br></p><p><strong>Updated to cover Unity Versions 5 to 2020 the course now&nbsp;contains 5 hours of extra content with:</strong></p><ul><li><p>new challenges and projects</p></li><li><p>blending animations to create strafe sets</p></li><li><p>adjusting curves</p></li><li><p>designing a character and the&nbsp;placing of&nbsp;motion capture with free third-party tools</p></li></ul><p><strong><br>Learn how to animate&nbsp;and work with:</strong></p><ul><li><p>the mecanim timeline</p></li><li><p>curve and keyframe editors</p></li><li><p>animation events that trigger code</p></li><li><p>root motion</p></li><li><p>imported animations created in third party packages</p></li><li><p>animation state machines</p></li></ul><p><strong><br>Contents and Overview</strong></p><p>The course begins with the very basics of the Unity interface and progresses to an in-depth examination of all the mecanim components (including the Animation, Animator, DopeSheet and Curve windows). The majority of lectures are follow-along, hands-on workshops in which the student will explore a variety of animation techniques from creating a simple bouncing ball, through to a complex animation for a wall climbing character.&nbsp;Animated models and starter projects are included for students who are not confident in creating their own. By the end of this course, the student will have thoroughly explored the functionality of the mecanim system, under the instruction of an internationally-recognised&nbsp;professor,&nbsp;and be well on their way to developing snippets of code to control all aspects of 3d&nbsp;game animation.</p>",

You'll code in JavaScript for HTML5 Canvas, so a text editor and ordinary web browser are all you need (an art program can be handy for a few sections but is not required). I've attached my code for each step so you'll never be stuck. At the end you'll learn even more ways to apply what you've learned. Also by completing the course you'll get a PDF of my complete 500-page textbook on game development: Hands-On Intro to Game Programming. The book contains over 100 exercises, a couple of more game types, and additional material with more detail about the projects you created in this course.</p><p>(HTML5 Logo in the course image is by W3C, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported.

  "description": "<p>Maths and video games go hand-in-hand. Video games are a practical, challenging, and fun way to <strong>sharpen your math skills</strong>. What's more, video games are like living math. From graphics and physics, to AI and movement, <strong>games are full of math</strong>.</p><p>Learn foundational math concepts relevant to game development. In the course <strong>we break it down and build it back up, block by block</strong>. For each skill you will start from an interesting real-world problem. You'll always understand why you're learning a concept, and feel motivated to solve the problem in hand. In the course you will learn:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>How to write and solve equations relevant to game development.</p></li><li><p>Basic trigonometry the fun way, triangles, circles &amp; stuff.</p></li><li><p>Enough vector math to make 2D and 3D games.</p></li><li><p>About imaginary &amp; complex numbers, angles &amp; quaternions.</p></li></ul><p>The concepts learnt will help you create interesting scoring mechanics, have one object smoothly follow another, calculate the path of a projectile, target enemies using triangles and understand how random item drops work.</p><p>This course is the result of a successful Kickstarter, and consistent demand from our community of hundreds of thousands of students worldwide. There is a <strong>real need to improve math skills</strong>, not just for games, but for many areas of life. You'll be amazed how much more colourful the world looks as your math improves.</p><p>All the math you learn will be reinforced with quizzes. You'll write your own handwritten notes as you go, to help you remember your skills. We'll translate some of the math to pseudocode so you can <strong>see how it applies to C#, C++, Python</strong> and any other modern language.</p><p>Get plugged into our communities of amazing developers on Facebook (nearly 20k), in our own TA-curated Community (17k views/day), and our student chat group (10k live at any one time).</p><p>You will get <strong>full lifetime access for a single one-off fee</strong>. The creators are qualified and experienced coders and avid gamers, so are able to explain complex concepts clearly, as well as entertain along the way.</p><p><strong>Join us on this exciting journey now</strong>, you won't be disappointed!</p>",

You can see some cool shaders, glow, screenshake, post processing, tooltip, lots of UI elements, smooth camera, particles and so on. The final game <strong>plays </strong>really <strong>great </strong>and feels very satisfying.</p><p>This course starts with a <strong>completely empty project</strong> starting completely from scratch and <strong>step-by-step </strong>we will get to the final game.</p><p>Everything is built in a very clean and modular way so you can easily take this as a base and expand upon it with more Building Types, Enemies, Maps and so on.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>This course is presented as a thorough<strong> step-by-step guide </strong>where I will show you exactly <strong>how to do</strong> what I'm doing and <strong>why</strong> it is that I'm doing it so you can <strong>learn how to think</strong> like a game developer.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>This course will cover a bunch of topics including:</strong></p><ul><li><p>How to create a Building System</p></li><li><p>Handle Building construction and Resource spending</p></li><li><p>Also how to manage Resource Generation</p></li><li><p>Handle Enemy AI with Attack Logic and a Health System</p></li><li><p>Build up the World with Resources in specific places</p></li><li><p>Learn the basics of Unity tools like Shader Graph, Post Processing, Particle System...</p></li><li><p>And much much more!</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>As for requirements you really just need to know the absolute <strong>basics </strong>of <strong>Unity</strong> and<strong> C#</strong>.</p><p>If you've never touched Unity or C# before then there are<strong> two lectures</strong> in the <strong>extras </strong>section which<strong> </strong>cover the <strong>basics</strong></p><p>If you know, how Unity works, what are Game Objects and Components, what is MonoBehaviour and basic C# syntax then you should be able to follow everything without any issues.</p><p><br></p><p>If you feel confused or lost at any point in the course make sure you post your questions in the <strong>Q&amp;A section</strong></p><p>I will be there to <strong>help </strong>with whatever issues you may have</p><p><br></p><p>Alright so go ahead join me on the course and lets build this awesome game together!</p><p><strong>- Code Monkey</strong></p>",

In short you will <strong>build your own maths library</strong> to replicate some of Unity's Vector2, Vector3, Matrix4x4 and some Mathf methods.&nbsp; Throughout, we will be using the <strong>Unity Game Engine</strong> to help emphasise the mathematics concepts.</p><p>Join Dr Penny de Byl as she introduces game development mathematics using her internationally acclaimed holistic teaching style and expertise from over 25 years of teaching, research and work in games and computer graphics. Through-out the course you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to teach you the vital mathematical techniques used in programming computer game mechanics and visuals.</p><p>During the course we will be building a game that not only uses the code we've written to move 2D and 3D objects around on the screen, but to play the game you will have to use your knowledge of points and vectors to solve puzzles that will reinforce your learning.&nbsp; You will also build numerous mini projects to apply mathematical concepts and see how they work in games environments.</p><p><strong>Learn how to program and work with:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Bitwise Operations, Bit Packing and Bitboards</p></li><li><p>2D and 3D Space</p></li><li><p>Points</p></li><li><p>Vectors</p></li><li><p>Matrices</p></li><li><p>Mapping from one coordinate system to another</p></li><li><p>Positioning Objects</p></li><li><p>Navigation</p></li><li><p>Angles</p></li><li><p>Interpolation</p></li><li><p>Quaternions</p></li></ul><p><strong>What students are saying about this course:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Brilliant course. Might be the most helpful course I've found on Udemy so far. Penny is an amazing instructor. Even by the end of the first section learned super valuable information that I can apply to my games.</p></li><li><p>Early in the program but already learned enough to make the purchase price worthwhile.</p></li><li><p>As always, the professor delivers a great, clear course on a badly needed subject to learn. She is so knowledgeable and can impart her knowledge to her students. I recommend all her courses and her YouTube channel.</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p><strong>All New Content Added for Unity 2020+ and works with Unity 6!</strong></p><p>Did you know that there is not one single cube used&nbsp;in Minecraft?&nbsp;Have you ever looked at Minecraft and wondered, \"How did they build it?\" - a great thing to ponder, it is. &nbsp;If you haven't and think that programming a whole bunch of cubes is child's play, then think again. On the surface&nbsp;Minecraft looks as though it would be a simple world to recreate in Unity. Start placing cubes around a scene and see how far you get before the frame-rate grinds to a mind-numbing&nbsp;halt.&nbsp; So wonder and fret no longer, as this course reveals the secrets of programming and rendering procedurally-generated voxel worlds, like Minecraft,&nbsp;with C# in Unity.</p><p>In this course, Penny teaches all the invaluable skills you will require to build a blocky world from scratch using her internationally acclaimed teaching style and&nbsp;knowledge from over 30 years working with games and graphics. &nbsp;But hold on tight as you'll be taken on a journey across the computer graphics realm as it is taught to post-graduate university students. Through detailed descriptions and hands-on workshops examining all you need to know about 3d data structures, building meshes from scratch, using noise algorithms to generate terrain features and caves, and&nbsp;texturing blocks you will be programming your own world in no time.</p><p><strong>Learn how to program and work with:</strong></p><ul><li><p>voxels</p></li><li><p>custom built&nbsp;polygons and meshes</p></li><li><p>vertices and normals</p></li><li><p>UV mapping</p></li><li><p>texture atlases</p></li><li><p>parallel processing and the <strong>Unity Job System</strong></p></li><li><p>Unity's <strong>MeshAPI</strong> for parallel mesh creation</p></li><li><p>Perlin noise</p></li><li><p>infinite terrain generation</p></li><li><p>loading and saving data</p></li></ul><p><strong>Contents and Overview</strong></p><p>After getting a little experience in why it's such a bad idea to build a Minecraft type world using cubes, you'll start following along with Penny, exercise after exercise, toward the end of building your very own and unique blocky terrain.</p><p>You'll begin by dissecting&nbsp;a cube and examining its fundamental parts from vertices, to normals, to texture mapping. &nbsp;Armed with this knowledge, you will then begin writing code that redefines the cube and makes it far more efficient to draw as a terrain component. &nbsp;You'll then bring these pseudo-cubes together to form chunks, to optimise rendering performance.&nbsp;Once you've worked on creating a solid world of chunks you will then learn about smooth noise and a little fractal geometry will be introduced to assist you in carving out realistic landscape features including caves.</p><p>With terra-firma to stand on, you'll next&nbsp;add a player character and start exploring the new world. &nbsp;To prevent you falling off, you will also start working on the logic to build the world around you in real-time, out to infinite boundaries.</p><p>When you are done with exploring, it will be time to start digging and building. &nbsp;It's in this part that you will learn how to add and remove blocks at the click of a button to further mould the terrain to your liking.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, you'll cover the dynamics of adding flowing water, falling sand and start working on the logic for creating your very own biomes.</p><p><strong>What students are saying about this course:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Hi! I wanted to thank you and compliment you for the Minecraft Unity course. I've been a (web) programmer for 20 years. After so long creating somewhat boring work I'm excited to make games. My interest is in creating procedurally generated, complex worlds. Learning about Minecraft, therefore, seemed like a good idea.</p></li><li><p>Love the amount of detail Penny goes into! Not too little, not too much, she manages to hit the sweet spot that gets you a deep understanding of what's going on, coupled with the ability to jump in with confidence and start doing things yourself. VERY pleased with my course purchase, and look forward to more by her!</p></li><li><p>Clear, concise, introduction and extension of concepts required to efficiently generate Minecraft style worlds, including Perlin noise and fractal Brownian motion.</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p><strong>This is the FIRST online course that will teach you how to create a First Person Shooter Multiplayer Game!!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The course is completely project based, and we are going to create four 3D games from scratch using Unity Game Engine.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will start with simple things so you will be comfortable even if you are using Unity for the first time. This also applies to your coding skills, if you did not code before, don't worry, we will deeply cover C# from basic to advanced features.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I had beginners and intermediate game developers on my mind when I structured this course, so it will not only give you all the information you need as a beginner, but it will also teach you advanced game development techniques if you already know how to make games. Every section in the course starts with basic information about the specific topic, and slowly progresses in difficulty as we finish every video.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You will also benefit from my super fast response if you have any issue that you are stuck with(I check Udemy forums every day if someone posts a question). Oh and all the students taking the course will also be there to help you!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lets take a look at the games that we are going to create inside of this course:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Save The Golem</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Our First game is called Save The Golem and its a simple game where pumpkins roll down the hill and you try to avoid them with your Golem character, this is just to get us started with game development and see how easy and simple it is to create your first game in 40 minutes.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Awesome Knight</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Our second game is a click and point game called Awesome Knight. In this game we create a character by our mouse, where we click on the screen the player will go towards that position. We will also be able to attack by using melee attack system and special attacks like fire tornado. This game will have enemies that have their or AI and path finding system and we also have a boss who has his own special attacks like throwing magic at us.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Awesome Heroes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The third game is an RPG game called Awesome Heroes. In this game we will learn how to create beautiful levels, player select system where we can select multiple players to play the game, we will have multiple worlds to explore and in each world we will have different enemies attacking us which makes the game more exciting. And not to forget that we are going to create an inventory system where we can select multiple weapons for our characters to battle the evil monsters we encounter in our quests.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>First Person Shooter Multiplayer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This is the most requested game I had and its finally here. First we will learn how to create and animate our fps character, add weapons in the game and shoot with those weapons, detect collision when shooting so that we can apply damage and of course add the famous hands that you see in every first person shooter game. After we finish all of that we will use unity's networking system to connect two players over lan and the internet to play against each other in a multiplayer death match.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the things you will learn in the course:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Unity's interface</li><li>Importing Assets</li><li>Organizing The Project</li><li>Basic, Intermediate And Advanced C# Programming</li><li>Basic AI(Artificial Intelligence)</li><li>Advanced AI(Artificial Intelligence)</li><li>Path Finding</li><li>Nav Mesh Agent</li><li>Basic And Advanced Character Animations</li><li>Sound FX And Music</li><li>Basic, Intermediate And Advanced Particle FX</li><li>Melee Battle Systems</li><li>Boss Fights</li><li>Special In Game Attacks</li><li>Learn How To Use Unity's UI System</li><li>Create And Animate Menus</li><li>Create Animation Trigger Events</li><li>Create Multiplayer Games With Unity's Networking System</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong><strong>That And Much More Is Awaiting You In This Course</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If You ever had an idea for an awesome game, then enroll in this course and learn the tools that you need to develop Your next hit game!!!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Is Your Risk By Taking This Course?</strong>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nothing!!

  "description": "<p>Welcome to your unreal engine 5 one course solution for Niagara VFX, in this course ,you are gonna learn how to create different types of VFX like <strong>Portal FX, Rain FX, Projectile FX, Energy Strike, character disintegration, and much much more.</strong> And we’ll start from scratch.</p><p><br></p><p>In the first section, you are going to learn all the basic stuff that you need to know about Niagara for creating different VFX by creating dandelion FX and flame thrower. We are first going to cover the different emitter stages inside of Niagara, then start using the sprite renderer to help us to get more familiar with different Niagara modules.</p><p><br></p><p>With all the knowledge and skills we have, in the second section, we are going to create different types of VFX like portal FX, hit impact FX, butterfly FX, meteor attack, laser attack, energy strike, and projectile FX like blade slash and flying sword. We’ll begin with the portal FX and start modifying our master materials created in the last section to support more VFX features. Then, we’ll use blueprint to create a VFX spawner and use it to spawn this hit impact surface and hit impact body FX. After that, we’ll discuss the 3 most important states a VFX must have in order for it to be complete by creating this meteor attack. After that, we’ll go into blender and create a projectile mesh for our Niagara and use blueprint to help us spawn blade slash and flying sword.</p><p><br></p><p>In the third section, you’ll learn how to create follow the leader FX, rain FX, waterfall FX, different dissolving effect for texture, static mesh and skeletal mesh. We’ll start with all the basic concepts that you must know for creating a custom Niagara module, then with the knowledge on Niagara parameter, namespaces, we’ll create this follow the leader FX. Then with a little bit of vector math and some calculation in our own custom modules, we’re going to create a more advanced version of it. Then, with all we’ve learned, we’ll look into how to create rain FX, waterfall FX and&nbsp;dissolving FX for texture, static mesh and combine them with distance field to help us create dynamic character disintegration.</p><p><br></p><p>This is going to be the most comprehensive Niagara VFX course that you'll ever find online, and after finishing it, you should be able to create any type of VFX that you like on your own.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Want to create code that is robust, optimized and reusable? Then you need to learn about programmming design patterns.</p><p>Game Programming Design Patterns are templates for building modularised code that are generally a repeatable solution to a commonly occurring mechanic applied in computer games. They are general solutions that aren’t tied to a particular problem, making them reusable. One such pattern is object pooling. Whether a game needs an onslaught of constantly spawning zombies or bullets fired from a gun or asteroids to pummel the player’s spaceship, an object pool is a group of classes that can be reused, exactly as they are, across not only these scenarios but a plethora of others whenever game objects need a spawn manager.</p><p>In this course, Penny will take you through the top 12 game programming design patterns with C# and the Unity Game Engine using her internationally acclaimed Holistic teaching style and expertise from over 25 years teaching, researching and writing about games. Throughout the course you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to teach you these core programming concepts that will take your games to the next level.</p><p>Learn how to program and work with patterns such as:</p><ul><li><p>commands</p></li><li><p>flyweight</p></li><li><p>observer</p></li><li><p>prototype</p></li><li><p>singleton</p></li><li><p>states</p></li><li><p>object pools</p></li><li><p>game loops</p></li><li><p>updates</p></li><li><p>components</p></li><li><p>...and more.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Contents and Overview</strong></p><p>The course begins with a brief introduction and then you are straight into hands-on exercises, working through each of the design patterns as listed above. There are a variety of scenarios you will work on in both 2D and 3D from an asteroid shooter, to a radar object finding system to a programmable prototype prefab system. All starter files and Unity assets (including models and scenes) are provided for you. </p><p>If you want to become a knowledgeable and skilled game developer, then this course is for you.</p><p><strong>What students are saying about Penny's courses:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Excellent course!! I am already in game development industry and there is one quote here from the course that says it all \"Whenever you are not able to solve complex problem, its the right time to get back to the BASICS\".</p></li><li><p>She is the best teacher ever in this platform</p></li><li><p>I do like Penny de Byl's courses and way of teaching, they are much more specific than your average \"master Unity\" kind of courses and usually you don't learn just the engine, but also how things work behind the scenes (albeit briefly, at least it gives you an idea if you want to investigate more on your own). She's really amazing!</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>This course provides a full guide on trading card game battle mechanics. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>The material in this course is divided into 6 Sections. Section 1 features a short introduction to the course.  \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>In Section 2 we will focus on making cards. We will use Unity UI features to create both faces and card backs of our cards. Spell cards and creature cards will be designed a bit differently. Creature cards will have distinctive oval frames around creature images. You will learn how to rotate cards that are made with Unity UI properly. We will do some scripting to make a simple system that will allow us to create and edit our cards as assets in Unity. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>In Section 3 we will continue working on different visual elements: mana pools, rope timer, hero portraits, end turn button and so on. By the end of this Section we will assemble a visual layout of our Battle Scene that our players will see in the final version of the game. We will also explore several scripts that will help us drag cards in the game, organize and display enlarged previews of cards and creatures.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>In Section 4 we will prepare our project for bringing in all the scripts that will handle Logic in our game. We`ll start by taking a look at a small slideshow that will explain the relationship between Visual and Logical parts of our game. We`ll add several new Visual features – Damage Effects that will display amounts of damage taken by creatures or heroes in the game, a simple system that will show messages in the start of each turn and targeted dragging for spell cards and creature attacks.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>Section 5 is the most complicated Section of this course in terms of scripting. We`ll bring all the remaining scripts, including all the Logic scripts into our project. Our goal for this Section is to establish the most basic game mechanics of drawing cards from deck, playing creatures onto the battlefield and attacking either our opponent`s hero or his creatures. We will also discuss turn management and test our burning rope timer.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>In the final section of this course you will learn to create spell and creature effects for your game. Creature effects might be caused when the creature enters the battlefield, when the creature dies, when the turn starts or ends or even when certain events occur in the game (like: when your Hero takes damage, draws a card, etc…). We will also take a look at a simple AI script that will control our opponent`s behavior and let us play this game against the computer.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>I have tried to save the project that I was working in as often as I can so that you can easily pick up the material from any point in this course. All these assets that are used to create cards, creatures, hero powers and other game elements are free for commercial use and available for download with this course. You can find detailed info on art and scripting assets and links to some other useful resources in the Credits file that you can download with this course.</p>",

  "description": "<p>01. we start from very basic stuff like:</p><p>1.\tDownloading and installing unreal engine 5</p><p>2.\tCreate different kind of project</p><p>3.\tMoving around the scene</p><p>4.\tChange objects position in different ways</p><p>5.\tChange scale and rotation</p><p>6.\tAbout world space and local spaces</p><p>7.\tUse snapping to make our life easier</p><p>8.\tCamera speed and different kind of views</p><p>9.\tAbout outliner, detail panel and content drawer</p><p><br></p><p>02. Next, we start with what is static mesh and importing different kind of them into unreal engine from different sources </p><p>And we talk about different problem that can happen when you import something </p><p>We talk about this kind of 3d objects:</p><p>1.\timport 3d models that have material but no texture attached</p><p>2.\timport 3d model that doesn’t have textures</p><p>3.\timport 3d model that has multiple part and multiple material</p><p>4.\tquixel 3d models and materials</p><p>03. next we start with first part of material section of this course </p><p>in this section we learn all the basic stuff of material in unreal engine that you should know to be able to import different kind of 3d model into unreal engine</p><p>this is basic section for material so we learn this basic stuff about them:</p><p>1.\tCreate our first material</p><p>2.\tWhat is base color</p><p>3.\tmetallic roughness and specular in materials</p><p>4.\twhat is emissive color and how we can use them properly</p><p>5.\thow to use textures in materials</p><p>6.\tand at the end of this very basic section ill give you some exercise</p><p><br></p><p>04. Next, we start with Game mode</p><p>First what is game mode and why we need them in unreal engine 5 </p><p>Next, we check some game modes like vehicle and first-person game mode</p><p>After that we start creating our own game mode as third person game mode</p><p><br></p><p>05. In next section we talk about how we can create playable character </p><p>We will talk about:</p><p>1.\twhat is character class</p><p>2.\thow our character can move</p><p>3.\thow it can jump </p><p>4.\thow it can look up and down</p><p>5.\thow it can have cameras to be like first person or third person</p><p>6.\thow we can use spring arm properly</p><p>06. next we talk about the animations</p><p>for this section again we start from very basic stuff to more advanced stuff and because this section is much more important, I divided in to two sections so you will learn them as deep as possible in right time</p><p>1.\twe start with animation sequence, what it is and how we can use it</p><p>2.\twe learn about playing animation where ever we want</p><p>3.\tnext we learn about animation blueprint, what it is and why it is very important to use it</p><p>4.\twe learn about state machines</p><p>5.\thow our character can walk jump run for basic movement</p><p>6.\thow we can use cached animations</p><p>7.\twhat is blend space 1D and 2D and how we can use them</p><p>8.\tand at the end ill give you some exercise so you will learn this basic part better</p><p><br></p><p>07. in next section we will talk about BLUEPRINT and what you should know about them as starter</p><p><br></p><p>1.\thow blueprint works</p><p>2.\thow you can find what is in your mind in blueprint to do what you want to do</p><p>3.\twe talk about camera filed of view as an example to see how we can find stuff in blueprint</p><p>4.\thow we can change camera location</p><p>5.\twhat is timeline and how we can animate things with timeline </p><p>6.\thow we can make our timeline smooth</p><p>7.\twhat is the lerp node and how we can use them</p><p>8.\thow to organize variables</p><p>9.\twhat is collapse node and where to use it</p><p>10.\twhat are macros in unreal engine 5</p><p>11.\twhat is function in blueprint and how it works and how we can use them</p><p><br></p><p>08. now that we know more about blueprint, we go back to animation again and we learn about:</p><p><br></p><p>1.\tturn right and turn left animation</p><p>2.\taim offset</p><p>3.\thow we can have both turns and Aim offset together</p><p>4.\tanimate spring arm</p><p>5.\twhat are animation montages and how we can use them</p><p>6.\twhat is layering animation with layered blend per bone and how we can use them</p><p>7.\tat the end we always go back to animation blueprint as we learn new things </p><p>09. next as a challenge and an exercise with the knowledge that we learn till here we create laser beam like laser beam of resident evil 4</p><p>10. in next section we start with user interface </p><p>As a basic UI for our game we start with widget blueprint basic stuff</p><p>1.\thow we can create widget blueprint</p><p>2.\twhat is an slot and why we should use them</p><p>3.\twhat is graphics options</p><p>4.\twhat is render transform</p><p>5.\twe talk about texts in separate video</p><p>11. in next section we use what ever we learned from last section to create our own crosshair</p><p>We won’t stop there and we populate some functionality for our crosshair like spreading when we shoot our gun or jumping</p><p><br></p><p>12. at this point epic game release its unreal engine 5.1 and we learn how we can update our game and engine to latest version that is 5.1 at the time </p><p><br></p><p>13.after that we go back to crosshair and user interface section again to add more functionality to our game like Crosshair Spread with walking and running jumping and shooting the gun and crosshair be Accurate when aiming, and for doing all of these we learn about some new nodes that are important to know like:</p><p><br></p><p>1.\thow interp to work and how we can use them</p><p>2.\thow to use timers with event and functions</p><p>3.\thow to use line trace </p><p>4.\twhat is yaw and pitch and roll and how we can calculate them</p><p>5.\tdynamic yaw and pitch offset calculation</p><p><br></p><p>14. next we should learn about audio in unreal engine </p><p>Right now, there is two type of audio engine in ue5.1 first one is sound cue and second one is meta sound</p><p>Both of them are important and we learn both of them in separate sections</p><p><br></p><p>1.\thow to import audio files to unreal engine 5</p><p>2.\tambient sound options</p><p>3.\twhat is attenuation and how we can use them to create realistic audio</p><p>4.\thow to play sound from blueprint</p><p>5.\tbranch in sound cue</p><p>6.\tConcatenator</p><p>7.\tContinues modulator</p><p>8.\tDelay node</p><p>9.\tModulator</p><p>10.\tHow to randomize stuff with Random node</p><p>11.\tWhat is switch node and how we should use it</p><p><br></p><p>15.after this we should learn about meta sound</p><p>New way of sound design for games that you can use to create music too . whatever you see other games can do with music and sound you can do it with meta sound easier</p><p> for this section we learn all the basic next as an example we create a music with some beats after that as another example we create an ambient sound with some effects and for doing them we will learn about:</p><p><br></p><p>1.\tHow to create meta sound</p><p>2.\tWhat is the inputs </p><p>3.\tTrigger repeat </p><p>4.\tDelay node</p><p>5.\tWhat is graph input</p><p>6.\tHow we can control meta sound from blueprint</p><p>7.\tHow we can use mixers</p><p>8.\tHow we can use sine waves</p><p>9.\tWhat is envelopes</p><p>10.\tRandomize playing audios</p><p>11.\tHow to use ADSR envelope float</p><p>12.\tWhat is BPM and how we can use it</p><p>13.\tHow we can use notes in meta sound</p><p>14.\tHow we can use beats to create music</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>16. next we use all of our knowledge that learn till here to add sound to our own game </p><p>For our course game we add footstep audio and weapon fire shot audio</p><p>1.\tFirst, we find some audio from internet</p><p>2.\tWe learn how to extract and convert audios that we find from internet</p><p>3.\tWe use animation sequence to play sound when foot touch the ground</p><p>4.\tWe learn how to use anim notifier</p><p><br></p><p>17. now it is time to learn more about materials, learn more advanced stuff and during course we add to our material knowledge as well because some section we should learn it by practical example</p><p>So that’s why I’m saying animation section will never end and we will add to it when you learn enough about other things</p><p>Material as well we will learn more with practical examples during course</p><p>But for this section we will learn about:</p><p><br></p><p>1.\tPreview panel</p><p>2.\tData types with base color</p><p>3.\tRoughness</p><p>4.\tTexture sample</p><p>5.\tLerp in materials</p><p>6.\tTexture coordinate</p><p>7.\tComponent mask and append Many</p><p>8.\tTime node</p><p>9.\tPanner</p><p>10.\tMaterial instances</p><p>11.\tComments</p><p>12.\tSine node</p><p>13.\tSine remapped node</p><p>14.\tAnimate opacity</p><p>15.\tAnimate World position offset</p><p>16.\tWhy we should use Reroute node and how to use it</p><p>17.\tHow to control Brightness contrast saturation and tint color</p><p>18.\tSwitch and texture parameter</p><p><br></p><p>18. now that we know enough about material and blueprint we can learn Niagara particle system in unreal engine 5.1</p><p> For this section we start from very basic stuff in Niagara and we will create a lot of effects and logic in there</p><p>Like fire, smoke, bullet shell ejection, blood splatter on the ground, muzzle flash and …</p><p>For all of these effects first we need to learn all the basic stuff like:</p><p><br></p><p>1.\tCreate empty Niagara system</p><p>2.\tSpawn rate</p><p>3.\tHow velocity work and how to use it</p><p>4.\tWe will talk about Initialize particle module</p><p>5.\tCurves</p><p>6.\tShape location for spawning particle in a shape</p><p>7.\tWe talk about forces in Niagara system like Gravity force and drag</p><p>8.\tNiagara Options</p><p>9.\tWe will talk about how to use subuv textures in Niagara</p><p>10.\tNext, we talk about Niagara parameters</p><p>11.\tNext, we talk about different type of renderer like Ribbon renderer</p><p>12.\tLight renderer</p><p>13.\tMesh renderer</p><p>14.\tAnd next we will learn how we can spawn particle on the body of our character</p><p>19. in the next section we use all the knowledge that we learn from material and Niagara section to create some effect for our course project</p><p>1.\tFirst, we import some static mesh for our Niagara system for shell injection </p><p>2.\twe create material for that bullet and shell</p><p>3.\twe create our VFX and add it to gun of our character</p><p>4.\twe create muzzle flash material</p><p>5.\tfor creating muzzle flash VFX we use multiple Niagara emitter </p><p>6.\twe design another Niagara system for when bullet hit something </p><p>7.\tat the end we learn how to add decal automatically where bullet hit something</p><p><br></p><p>20.because we need to create different kind of bullet, we should learn more about collision and physics in UE 5.1</p><p>That’s why in this section we learn about</p><p><br></p><p>1.\twhat is collision and physics in UE</p><p>2.\twe learn about simple and complex collision</p><p>3.\twe learn pro way of creating simple collision that is more efficient</p><p>4.\tnext we learn about physics simulation</p><p>5.\twe learn about different kind of collision and their event</p><p>6.\tafter that we learn about collision preset and object types</p><p><br></p><p>21.with all of our knowledge till now we create 3 kind of bullet for our course project</p><p>1.\tfirst bullet we create it with simple adding </p><p>2.\tsecond bullet we create it with physics and applying forces</p><p>3.\tand third bullet we use Projectile movement, the library that unreal engine developers created for us</p><p>22. next it is time to talk about lights and fogs</p><p><br></p><p>1.\twe learn about dynamic light and baked light</p><p>2.\tpoint light</p><p>3.\tspot light</p><p>4.\trect light</p><p>5.\tskylight</p><p>6.\tsun Direction light</p><p><br></p><p>23. now that all the basics are covered it is time to create some level</p><p>We will create two level </p><p>One just a small town and another one really big landscape</p><p>But as beginner we should start with small town</p><p><br></p><p>1.\twe talk about marketplace and its asset</p><p>2.\twe learn how to create blend material and how to use them. so, you can see we are learning more about material with practical case use</p><p>3.\twe will start by creating some road and sidewalks</p><p>4.\tnext we add some puddles</p><p>5.\tnext we learn a lot of tricks for positioning stuff on our level </p><p>6.\t</p><p>7.\tnext it is time to add some props</p><p>8.\tnext we add some light that at night turn on and at day it turn off</p><p>9.\tnext we add traffic lights that automatically work and turn on and off by itself</p><p>10.\twe add some trees and bushes in old way</p><p>11.\tnext we learn some tricks about selecting object </p><p>12.\tnext we use foliage system as basic as possible because foliage has its own section</p><p>13.\tnext we use nanite to optimize our level more</p><p>14.\tnext we start creating our building and its lights</p><p>15.\tnext we add day and night cycle to our scene and we learn to do it in two different way that has their advantages</p><p>16.\tnext we learn about if it is day or night so all light automatically turn off during day</p><p>17.\tnext we talk about event dispatcher in detail</p><p>18.\tnext we learn how we can modalized building so we can use them multiple time where ever we want</p><p><br></p><p>24. in next section we will learn all about different kind of creating landscape </p><p>With unreal engine and with Gaea</p><p> </p><p>1.\tfirst, we learn how we can create landscape in unreal engine</p><p>2.\tnext we learn how we can use landmass to create landscape</p><p>3.\tnext we learn about ocean in unreal</p><p>4.\tnext we talk about rivers</p><p>5.\tnext we use Gaea that is really cool and easy to use software to create really good landscape</p><p>6.\twe will talk about Gaea graph and how it works</p><p>7.\tnext we learn how to import Gaea landscape to unreal engine</p><p>8.\tnext we learn the calculation for importing from Gaea to unreal</p><p><br></p><p>25. next we use what we learn to create landscape for our course project </p><p>For that we use Gaea to create our landscape</p><p>1.\tcreate some mountain</p><p>2.\tcombine and transform landmasses in gaea</p><p>3.\tbuild our landscape</p><p>4.\timport it to unreal engine with right calculation</p><p><br></p><p>26. now it is time to learn all about tricks and tips for creating material for our landscape</p><p>1.\twe learn where to download right textures for our landscape</p><p>2.\twe learn about materials function and how we can use them</p><p>3.\twe learn all about material function inputs</p><p>4.\twe learn about

  "description": "<p>Have you ever wanted to create your own Farming RPG?&nbsp; Games like Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon have been incredibly successful, and you too can develop your own game with the help of this course. We'll explain how to develop many of the core systems and game functionality.&nbsp; We'll start with a blank project and then develop the game lecture by lecture, covering all the code and Unity configuration you will need.&nbsp; This course is massive with over 44 hours of lecture videos, 99 lectures, a starter assets pack, and a complete Unity project that you can download to follow along. We even provide another Unity project to demonstrate AStar pathfinding! So while it took the creator of Stardew Valley over 4 years to create his game, you can get a head start by using this course, potentially saving many months or even years of development time !&nbsp; This is one of the most comprehensive intermediate Unity 2D development courses on Udemy.&nbsp; We hope that you decide to take the course and join the thousands of students who have already taken their next steps in advancing their Unity game development skills using a sophisticated, intermediate project based course.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing you in the lectures!&nbsp; </p><p>*** This is an Intermediate Course - Please check the Requirements Section for the experience you need before taking this course ***</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Updated for Unity in 2024</strong></p><p>The creation of beautiful virtual terrains isn't just the domain of the artist, but also of the programmer. What if you could use your programming skills in C# to manipulate a mesh to create realistic landscapes, using algorithms developed by researchers studying landscape formation and erosion? Well now you can.</p><p>In this course, Penny introduces procedural terrain generation techniques using her internationally acclaimed holistic teaching style and expertise from over 25 years of teaching, research and work in games and computer graphics. Throughout the course you will follow along with hands-on workshops, designed to teach you the fundamental techniques used for generating realistic virtual landscapes.</p><p><strong>Learn how to program and work with:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Voronoi Tessellation</p></li><li><p>Midpoint Displacement</p></li><li><p>Perlin Noise</p></li><li><p>Splat Maps</p></li><li><p>Trees and Vegetation</p></li><li><p>Clouds</p></li><li><p>Weather</p></li><li><p>Erosion</p></li><li><p>Water and new to 2024</p></li><li><p>Working with Multiple Terrain Objects</p></li><li><p>Dealing with <strong>URP</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>HDRP</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>Contents and Overview</strong><br>The course begins by examining the nature of a landscape and the design considerations you should include in making decisions on structure, colour and vegetation. You'll learn what makes for a natural looking terrain, so you can replicate this in Unity.</p><p>Following on, we will examine some of the most popular algorithms used in generating terrains (including many fractal and tessellation techniques) that can be used together, to form random and yet convincing mountainous vistas.</p><p>Once you are confident with landscape formation, we'll move onto texturing the terrain with a variety of images that can be placed via splatmaps onto differing heights and gradients. Then, continue to decorate the terrain with trees, rocks and grass placed with an algorithmic approach before investigating erosion methods, that will add that extra level of realism.</p><p>The course concludes with the development of a cloud generation system and an exploration of particle systems for adding rain, snow and other atmospheric effects to the finalised landscape.</p><p>Throughout, we'll be developing our own custom Unity editor code that will allow you to build extra functionality and structure into the Unity Inspector, as well as create Editor Windows of your very own.</p><p><strong>What students are saying about Penny's courses:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Penny is an excellent instructor and she does a great job of breaking down complex concepts into smaller, easy-to-understand topics.</p></li><li><p>Penny's teaching style is exceptionally well-motivated and illustrated.</p></li><li><p>This course is awesome. The lecturer explains everything you need to know and encourages you to experiment and challenge yourself.</p></li></ul>",

(Compatible with Unity 2018+)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here's What Students Are Saying:</strong></p><p><em>\"I am enjoying the course, it is one of the best on Unity I have seen, Everything is explained well and the game being built seems fully featured, other tutorials often leave stuff out that you would probably like to see how to do. I would recommend this for beginners and those with some experience with Unity and C#\"</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"I have only just finished section 2 of the course but it is already FAR better than any other Unity course or tutorial I have found (and I did a lot of looking)! This has been a great experience so far. I feel like I will finally be able to learn the skills needed to fulfill my dream of designing and building a genuine Unity mobile game that I can actually publish. Thanks for the great course! Update: Just wanted to add how impressed I am with the speed and detail of the instructor's responses to my questions. I had some issues (totally my fault) getting things working and even after we got them resolved, Sonny made sure to respond with detailed explanations with photos to make sure I understood why the issues occurred and how the solutions actually worked. Honestly I could not be any happier with the quality of this course and its instructor. It is seriously so good!\"</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"This course was very great, it has a lot of small challenges to get you to use some of the features you have just learned. It is very detailed and the entire game is build very professionally with very good order and small but important details. Well-worth the price, and this will take you from beginner to pro, in no time. Just imagine being able to familiarize yourself with every single step of the way from idea to final game and how to have that very same game ONLINE on the Google Play Store in just a day's worth (just short of 20 hours) of lectures. Nothing less than incredible\"</em></p><p><strong>How Can This Course Help YOU?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Are you looking for a Unity 2d course that <strong>shows</strong> <strong>you</strong> <strong>WHAT</strong> steps to take and also explains the <strong>HOW</strong> &amp; <strong>WHY</strong> behind each step?</p></li><li><p>Do you feel that existing Unity tutorials don't contain the right content to help you with your goals?</p></li><li><p>Are you looking to learn how to <strong>monetize</strong> <strong>your mobile games</strong> in Unity?</p></li><li><p>Are you searching for a <strong>simple</strong> <strong>and easy</strong> to understand course which shows you how to build a mobile platformer game, step by step?</p></li><li><p>Do the terms sprites and sprite sheets confuse you?</p></li><li><p>Do you feel lost when it comes to C# scripting?</p></li><li><p>Are you baffled by the process of building mobile games in Unity which look good on different screens and resolutions?</p></li><li><p>Are Unity 2d concepts hard for you to understand?</p></li></ul><p>If you answered yes to any of these questions then i have good news!

None could help me get to a level where i could just start making 2d games with minimum effort. <strong>Sprite sheets, Sprite Editor, Canvas, Buttons, C# Scripting, Game Menus</strong> all seemed a bit out of reach. But i persisted.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I've built numerous mobile games for clients as well as my own projects. I realized that this stuff was not difficult but there was not much documentation or ample video tutorials to explain things in an <strong>easy to understand</strong> manner.

Or I suppose I could use a chatbot, but I'd rather have that human touch. This really is a stupid requirement, I said all I needed to say in only 110 words, which is much clearer than using 200, but because of some arbitrary rule, I'm now required to add this extra section that literally no one will read. Fantastic. Seven more, I guess it could be worse.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you ready to embark on an exciting journey into the world of game development? Good news - the path is wide open, and you're invited to join us!<br><br>In this course, we'll dive into the basics of creating games with MonoGame, a game framework that has a rich indie development heritage. You'll be in great company, as countless successful titles, including Stardew Valley, Celeste, Fez, Axiom Verge, and Bastion, have been built using this software, each with millions of sales on Steam.<br><br>We'll be using C#, a widely used programming language in the industry, to bring our game ideas to life. With this powerful combination of a solid game engine and a well-documented language, you'll have all the tools you need to transform your imagination into stunning games.<br></p><p>Now, let's talk about what makes this course special. It's all about hands-on, project-based learning. We'll apply the programming and game development fundamentals we discuss to create our very own MonoGame projects. No need to worry if you've never written a line of code before - this course is designed for beginners and seasoned developers alike. We've got content that will benefit everyone.<br><br>After an introduction to set the stage, we'll dive into three sections on C# programming and three sections on MonoGame development. By alternating between programming and game development, we'll have you up and running, creating games in no time.<br><br>Throughout the course, we'll build three games from scratch using MonoGame. We'll start with an exciting Shooting Gallery game where you'll aim and click on targets that pop up on the screen. Next up, we'll launch into a Spaceship game where you'll navigate through space, dodging incoming asteroids using the arrow keys. And to wrap it all up, we'll take on the challenge of creating a top-down action RPG. In this game, you'll control a player who explores a dynamic world, fights enemies, and shoots projectiles.<br><br>With each new game we develop, we'll build on the skills acquired in the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation in game development. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of all the essential components needed to create your own games, including playable characters, input controls, image rendering, collision detection, projectile shooting, enemy mechanics, player scoring, health tracking, animations, timers, and even a camera system.</p><p><br></p><p>To master these aspects of game development, we'll need a strong grasp of various C# concepts. That's where our programming sections come in. We'll cover a wide range of topics, such as variables and data types, conditional statements, classes and inheritance, methods, loops, switch statements, and data structures.<br><br>While we'll be exploring these concepts in the context of C#, the core fundamentals exist across many programming languages, so the knowledge gained here will serve you well beyond this course. And don't worry, if you're already familiar with programming, we've got you covered with a handy \"syntax review\" lecture. It'll walk you through the specific usage of these concepts in C#, allowing you to quickly catch up and apply your existing skills to this context.</p><p><br></p><p>By actively coding along with the lectures, the information will stick with you as we progress through the material. Plus, you'll have the completed projects right on your computer, ready for reference whenever you need a reminder or a source of inspiration. Armed with a solid understanding of C# and MonoGame, there will be no limits to what you can create!<br><br>So, are you ready to turn your game ideas into reality? Join us on this inspiring adventure, and let's build some incredible games together!</p>",

We recommend you take at least the first half of our Complete Unity Developer 2D or 3D, or equivalent, as a prerequisite.</p><p>You can <strong>use the dialogue and quest systems together or independently in any game or project you build</strong>. We’ll be using an RPG as an example. You <em>don't </em>need to have completed the previous parts of the RPG Series (the RPG Core Combat and Inventory Systems courses) but it will give you an advantage if you already have.</p><p>The course is <strong>project-based</strong> as we believe this is the best way to learn Unity and C#. You will not just be learning dry programming concepts, but applying them immediately to a real RPG as you go.</p><p>We’ll provide the RPG project created so far in the series so that you can practice integrating to an existing complex project. <strong>Every element of the project we touch will be fully explained</strong> and no knowledge of the project will be required.</p><p>In the course we will be building the following from scratch:</p><ul><li><p>A node based dialogue editor window</p></li><li><p>A ScriptableObject based dialogue asset</p></li><li><p>An in game dialogue UI</p></li><li><p>Dialogue triggers and condition to integrate with the gameplay</p></li><li><p>A quest list with multi-step objectives</p></li><li><p>Quest rewards given via the inventory system</p></li></ul><p>In the process of the course <strong>we will cover advanced topics</strong> such as: IEnumerators, Saving Systems, C# Events, Interfaces and Unity UI.</p><p>You will get full <strong>lifetime access</strong> for a single one-off fee. The creators are qualified and experienced coders and avid gamers, so are able to explain complex concepts clearly, as well as entertain along the way.</p><p>You will have access to a course forum where you can discuss topics on a course-wide basis, or down to the individual video. <strong>Get plugged into our communities of amazing developers</strong> on Facebook (nearly 20k), in our own TA-curated Community (17k views/day), and our student chat group (10k live at any one time).</p><p><strong>Dialogues and quests are core to many game genres</strong>.

This course covers all aspects of creating a complete platformer game in Godot including:</p><ul><li><p>Game mechanics like player movement, collectibles, and basic combat</p></li><li><p>Hazards like spikes and enemies</p></li><li><p>A seamless game loop and transitions between levels</p></li><li><p>Scene structure and project organization</p></li><li><p>Sound effects</p></li><li><p>A&nbsp;main menu, pause menu, options menu, and other UI&nbsp;elements</p></li><li><p>Finishing touches like camera shake, basic shaders, particle effects, and UI&nbsp;animations</p></li></ul><p>This list is not exhaustive - please see the course outline for a glimpse into the topics that are covered.</p><p>The goal of this course is to show you how to take an empty project and turn it into a small, complete game. In doing so, this course will expose you to many aspects of the Godot engine from input handling, to tilemaps, to particles, to audio, and more. By the time you complete this course, you will feel comfortable working on your own projects in Godot. You will walk away from this course with a solid foundational understanding of making games that are not only functional but also fun.</p><p>This course will help you greatly if:</p><ul><li><p>You have some game development knowledge and want to learn Godot</p></li><li><p>You have some programming knowledge and want to make games</p></li><li><p>Your games feel sterile and lack polish</p></li><li><p>You struggle to complete games and want to start and finish a project</p></li><li><p>You regularly participate in game jams and want to improve your ability to craft a fun but short experience</p></li></ul><p>Please note that this course is focused purely on the start-to-finish process of making a game. As such, there isn't any time spent explaining fundamental programming concepts. Familiarity with programming is strongly recommended before taking this course. Any programming experience is fine - GDScript is easy to use.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Learn how to include an inventory system for any of your projects that require items to be picked up, dropped, moved and equipped!</p><p>This highly acclaimed series was over <strong>200% funded on Kickstarter</strong>, and is designed for intermediate users of Unity. We recommend you take at least the first half of our Complete Unity Developer 2D or 3D, or equivalent, as a prerequisite.</p><p>This course is the second in our RPG series, you don't need to have completed the first part of the RPG Series (the RPG Core Combat course) but it will give you an advantage if you already have. </p><p>By enrolling in this course <strong>you will have access to the completed Inventory system as an asset pack</strong> which you can import into your existing project. We will also take you step-by-step through the process of using, modifying, improving and understanding the code that drives the asset pack.</p><p>Please note, <strong>this course follows a different format</strong>. Rather than building the inventory system from scratch, line-by-line, we will provide you with our code and then explain how the code works so that you understand it fully. This is an approach that <strong>works well for folks who are already competent with Unity and C# and wanting to \"get to the answer\" more quickly.</strong></p><p>Although this course is part of our RPG series, you can use the inventory system for any of your projects that require items to be picked up, dropped, moved and equipped. </p><p>In this course we will cover the following systems: </p><ul><li><p>The click-to-pickup and the runover-to-pickup systems</p></li><li><p>The dropping system</p></li><li><p>The tooltip overlay system</p></li><li><p>The stackable item system</p></li><li><p>The equipping system</p></li><li><p>The saving and loading system</p></li></ul><p>The course covers <strong>many advanced programming principles</strong> and goes into great depth to discuss good code architecture practices. We cover Interfaces, Virtual Methods, the debugging tool and many more things that aren't covered in our beginner courses.</p><p>You will have access to a course forum where you can discuss topics on a course-wide basis, or down to the individual video. Get plugged into our communities of amazing developers on Facebook (nearly 20k), in our own TA-curated Community (17k views/day), and our student chat group (10k live at any one time). Check out our reviews to see how people love this feature.</p><p>Building an RPG is an amazing way to <strong>level-up your game development skills</strong>, so why not join us and get started improving your game development right now?</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>!!! JUST UPDATED WITH UNITY 2020.3 LTS !!! (Also the lectures are now 1080p)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Welcome to Udemy's first Multiplayer Virtual Reality Development course!</strong></p><p>Virtual Reality is having its best time ever. Stuck in our homes, we find joy and happiness in VR. But some people still think VR is an isolating experience. </p><p><strong>Not anymore! Virtual Reality has the potential the be the next social impact in our lives. With Multiplayer implementation, we can meet people in Virtual Worlds and communicate with tools that do not exist in the real world. </strong></p><p><br></p><p>In this course, we build a Multiplayer VR project from scratch. Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit is used for the Virtual Reality solution. Also, Photon- PUN 2 asset is used for Multiplayer implementation. While learning, you will have much fun with the Game Assets that I will share with you. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>By enrolling in this course, you will learn Multiplayer VR Development Fundamentals such as:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Configuring a Unity project for Oculus Quest with the new XR Interaction Toolkit from Unity 2019.4</p></li><li><p>VR Keyboard Implementation</p></li><li><p>Connecting servers with player name</p></li><li><p>Joining Virtual rooms</p></li><li><p>Avatar Selection System</p></li><li><p>Full Multiplayer VR Synchronization (Head, Hands, Body)</p></li><li><p>Multiplayer VR Movement Synchronization for Teleportation and Joystick</p></li><li><p>Voice Chat for VR</p></li><li><p>Networked Grabbing</p></li><li><p>Editor Scripting for Multiplayer tests with only one headset</p></li></ul><p><strong>This course is tested with Oculus Quest only. However, it should work with Oculus Rift and Rift S without any issue. Because Unity's XR Interaction is used and it offers cross-platform support for VR Development. </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>At the end of the course, you will have a fully working Multiplayer VR Template project that you can even publish!</strong></p><p>Even if you do not have a VR Supported PC, I will show you how to easily test VR projects.</p><p>If you have a SteamVR supported headset, you can still follow the course.&nbsp; Because there is a special lecture explaining how to set up the project for OpenVR. Note that SteamVR is not officially supported by the XR Interaction toolkit, yet. But it will be and the course will be updated according to that.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Come and join me to build the Virtual Worlds that we will be living in...</strong></p><p>I will see you there...</p><p>-Tevfik</p>",

  "description": "<p>Getting started in <strong>game development</strong> doesn't have to be <em>scary</em>.&nbsp; All you need is the passion to learn and an inquisitive, experimental nature for combining code, animation, graphics, artificial intelligence, art and audio.&nbsp; Sounds like a lot?&nbsp; It is, but when you see how you as a solo developer can bring it all together there's a <em>touch of magic</em> in the air.</p><p>Unity is the number one game development engine due to its ease of use and yet powerful abilities.&nbsp; It works on all platforms and can export to desktop, console and mobile devices.&nbsp; It's a great way for the beginner to jump straight into the world of game development and get their hands on the tools used by AAA game studios to produce games such as <strong><em>Hearthstone</em></strong> (Blizzard Entertainment), <strong><em>Cities: Skylines</em></strong> (Colossal Order) and <strong><em>Monument Valley 2</em></strong> (ustwo Games) and best of all, for the beginner and hobbyist it is free!</p><p>In this course, Penny demystifies Unity's interface and plethora of tools to bring art, code, design, and more together to produce a fully-fledged First Person Shooter game completely from scratch. Using her internationally acclaimed teaching style and&nbsp;knowledge from over 25 years working with games,&nbsp;graphics, and having written two award-winning books on games A.I., Penny will take you from complete noob to a confident user of Unity.&nbsp;Throughout, you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to take you through every step of becoming familiar with all the functionality of the game engine.&nbsp; Throughout, you will work towards the creation of a First Person Shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world complete with zombies out for the player's brains!</p><p>This course was created with&nbsp;<strong>Unity 2019.3.11f</strong> however is compatible with <strong>Unity 2019.4.2f1 (LTS) </strong>on either <strong>Mac</strong> or <strong>PC</strong>.</p><p>The projects in this course have been tested in and work with <strong>Unity 6.</strong></p><p><strong>Learn how to code, animate, and work with:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The Unity Development Environment. </p></li><li><p>Unity's C# interface.</p></li><li><p>Terrain Sculpting Tools for creating game maps.</p></li><li><p>First Person Characters and Animations for Walking, Shooting, and Reloading.</p></li><li><p>Pickup Items for Medical Kits and Ammunition.</p></li><li><p>3D Models of Zombies to add Animations for Walking, Chasing and Attacking.</p></li><li><p>An inventory system to keep track of player health and ammunition supplies.</p></li><li><p>Navigation Meshes for programming the movement of zombies and path planning on a terrain.</p></li><li><p>Finite State Machines for defining enemy A.I. behaviours.</p></li><li><p>Constructing Ragdoll models for dynamic death animations.</p></li><li><p>A Heads Up Display to inform the player of their health level and ammunition level, complete with a radar for locating zombies and a compass to guide the player home.</p></li><li><p>Special Effects such as fire, blood splatter, and lighting techniques.</p></li><li><p>Building the game to a standalone product.</p></li></ul><p>All assets and incremental project files are included.</p><p><strong>Contents and Overview</strong></p><p>The course begins with a section to introduce you to the Unity interface.&nbsp; If you are already familiar with Unity, you can skip to Section 3.&nbsp; In this introductory session, we will cover Unity's window system, how to add models and textures, the creation of code to manipulate the properties of models, and the physics system.</p><p>Following this, we will start work on the First Person Character (FPC).&nbsp; You will learn how to add physics and code to move the character around, as well as add animated arms and a weapon that you can see in the game view.&nbsp; You will also work to add animations for firing and reloading the weapon.&nbsp; Audio effects for the player's footsteps and jumping will also be included here.</p><p>Next, you will create pickup items for medical kits and ammunition that can be scattered around the game environment to provide extra resources to the player when their health or bullet levels get low.&nbsp; Here you will learn about how colliders and triggers can be used to fire off code to update values on the player that store an inventory.</p><p>We will then jump into the Unity Terrain Sculpting tool and work through the creation of a large game map on which to place the FPC and enemies.&nbsp; You will work with textures to colour the terrain and models, to add extra details such as trees and grass.&nbsp; High-quality models of houses, rocks, fences, and other props will be included for you to be as creative as you like in developing the game environment.</p><p>By this point, you'll be ready to start adding the zombies.&nbsp; You will first begin with the zombie models and learn how to add animations to them and then move them about on the game environment using navigation meshes.&nbsp; Then we will cover one of the most popular artificial intelligence techniques used in games for creating simple behaviours in non-player characters; the Finite State Machine.&nbsp; You will develop enemies capable of wandering, chasing, attacking, dying, and standing idle.&nbsp; These actions will be linked to the location of the player such that the zombies will ignore the player when they are far away and only attack when in range.</p><p>Once these mechanics are in place, you will learn how to use raycasts to link the player's shooting animations with a hit to the zombie.&nbsp; When hit, the zombie death animation will play and you will also be able to add in a ragdoll instead at this point.&nbsp; We will work with spotlights to create a crosshair aiming system and program dead zombies to sink into the ground, to remove them from the game.</p><p>Last but not least, we tie everything together with a Heads Up Display complete with health meter, an ammunition count, a radar for detecting nearby zombies, and a compass to point the player toward their goal location.</p><p>Once you have put all the game mechanics in place, you'll learn several techniques for taking your game to a more professional level with special effects, extra audio &amp; feedback, and a main menu switching system.</p><p><em>This is the perfect course to get started with Unity if you are an absolute beginner or learn a few extra techniques if you are familiar with the engine.&nbsp; </em></p><p><strong>What students are saying about Penny's courses:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Excellent course!! I am already in game development industry and there is one quote here that \"Whenever you are not able to solve complex problem, its the right time to get back to the BASICS\"</em></p></li><li><p><em>Penny is a natural born teacher, able to explain otherwise difficult concepts in a fun, engaging way that just make such simple sense, and makes you wish you would have had her for a high-school teacher so long ago</em>. </p></li><li><p><em>This course is absolute gold! I am a Software Engineering Teacher as well as a solo game developer, and of all the courses I have taken on Udemy, this is has been the most useful and eye opening by far.</em></p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p><strong>A 2D game will be developed</strong> from scratch and you’ll quickly learn the basics of game development and more.</p><p>Perfect for <strong>Middle and High School students</strong> and just about anyone else who wants to get started developing games. No programming experience at all is required - just an interest in creating a game in <strong>Unity</strong>, the same software used to create <strong>Pokemon Go</strong> and so many other best selling games! You’ll painlessly learn the basics of scripting too, because the videos introduce scripting as necessary along the way in both Part I and Part II of the course.</p><p>You’ll be amazed at how fast you can learn Unity. And, you’ll quickly become confident with all the game-creating basics. The pace of each video is designed for ease of learning, and not designed to cram as much as possible into each lesson. As an option, for those of you who want to continue game development using more features of Unity, the Part II course is available to add to your journey…</p><p>And more good news: the Unity basics, features, tools, and principles you learn in this this course apply to all Unity games and apps you may develop! So no time is wasted learning 2D first - it's super fun, easy, and fast coming up to speed in Unity and then gaining the confidence to design and attack your next game. And that next game can be an AR, VR, 3D, or whatever you want because you'll have the knowledge to learn these new features quickly.&nbsp; Btw, I'm thinking about creating a 3D AR version of this game that can be played on your Android or Apple phone but also on the exciting META smartglasses (and possibly others). If you think you would be interested in such a course, please send me a message that you would be interested :) Thanks.</p><p><strong>What are students saying about this course?</strong></p><p><strong>AWESOME! </strong>This tutorial is clear and easy to understand. You have explained everything perfectly and I had no problems at all as well as in the last few tutorials. I have got to understand about developing games and I love it.</p><p>- The video has very good graphic's quality</p><p>- The sound is clear</p><p>- You speak nice a slow which makes me understand everything really easily</p><p>- This tutorial is really for the very beginners and I have learned new thing without problems at all.</p><p>PS: I was trying to search tutorials like this for weeks and now I found your videos, You won't even believe how proud am I because I would like to be a software or a game developer. Sorry for my English, but I am still learning. Thank You !&nbsp; <strong>BlenderModeling CZ</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>The C++ Survival Course is now available on my Patreon!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why does this course need to exist?</strong></p><p>Everyone has played a Battle Royale game such as Fortnite. Perhaps you've always wondered how to make your own, but found tutorials were too long and didn't get to the point?</p><p>I want to put an end to Game Development being tiresome and boring. <strong>That is why at the end of the 8 hour series, you'll have a fully working Battle Royale game</strong>, ready to be built on and made into your own.</p><p>That means that depending on your learning speed, you can have a <strong>working Battle Royale game completely finished in under a week</strong>. The lessons you will learn can be used to go on and make any other type of game you can think of.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How is this possible?</strong></p><p>Unreal Engine 4 is completely free to use and is a AAA quality engine, used to make games such as Fortnite, Bioshock,&nbsp;Gears of War, and Borderlands. <strong>Unreal Engine ships with Blueprints, an industry standard tool that is the perfect gateway into the games industry for a beginner with no technical knowledge.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Think of Blueprints as driving an automatic car: you'll be able to learn all the correct skills and concepts, without any extra distractions. It will also put you in a great position to go on to learn the more technical C++ language, if that is what you choose.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who is the teacher?</strong></p><p>The course is fully developed by Reuben Ward, who has been working professionally as an Unreal Engine Game Engineer, and has over 2 years experience working professionally developing Battle Royale games. He also has plenty of experience teaching game development, and his video tutorials have received over 1,500,000 views on YouTube.</p><p>I understand how difficult Game Development can be when getting started, and that is why I love to take the technical boring parts of game development and make them as simple as possible. I hope you'll join me in making your own Battle Royale game!</p>",

By the end of the course, you'll be able to make your very own 2D local multiplayer strategy games, which you can share with family and friends. </p><p>The game we will bring to life is simple, but will teach you the fundamentals of many tactic/strategy games such as turn by turn systems, attack &amp; defense, moving characters on grid-like environments, placing units, gaining resources and more! All with the C# programming language- if you understand the basics of coding, then this is the perfect opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of those fundamentals (such as functions, arrays, vectors, if statements) and learn extra tips and tricks related to turn by turn games. </p><p>You'll also learn how to make your own game characters. Starting with sketching, inking, and coloring using a 2D art application like Photoshop (but most of what is taught can be done using free alternatives, such as Gimp or Krita).</p><p>We will also learn how to rig and animate those characters inside of Unity using a simple bone-based method. </p><p>There will also be tutorials on particle effects, sounds, game juice, and UI. Everything that is needed to make a game will be covered in well-edited, fun, engaging videos. This course will immerse you in the life of a game creator, as you go on an epic journey to bring your visions to life.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why learn from us?</strong></p><p>My brother and I created this course to share our passion for making games and help others bring their unique visions to life!<br>We've been teaching aspiring game developers how to use Unity, code with the C# programming language, and make game art and animations for over two years. Our tutorials have been viewed by thousands and are very popular, every day we get dozens of developers thanking us for helping them out on their own game dev journey! </p><p>We've not only made tons of tutorials but we've also created plenty of games using Unity, both 2D, and 3D, on Itch io, Newgrounds, and Steam.<br>So we know what it's like to create a complete, polished experience from A to Z, and really want to equip you with the right tools and knowledge so you can do the same!</p>",

In this course I will walk you though, step by step, on how to to design the layout and the functionality of 7 unique, engaging, and most importantly, FUN&nbsp;games.&nbsp; By the end of this course, I promise that you will be coming up with your own game ideas and feel confident enough in your abilities to create them.</p><p><strong>In my experience teaching computer science, students tend to flourish under the basics but hit a wall when we approach object oriented programming.</strong>&nbsp; The shift to using Classes as a way to structure code is difficult and often times students don't have enough exposure to meaningful examples of how to use Classes to help make complex code more efficient.&nbsp; I believe by the end of this course, you will understand how to use classes.</p><ul><li><p>This course is designed in such a way that NO&nbsp;KNOWLEDGE&nbsp;OF&nbsp;CLASSES&nbsp;is needed to start!&nbsp; We will begin by learning the fundamentals of the Pygame library and video game design concepts as we move onto making 4 very fun arcade style games.</p></li><li><p>We will then review/teach concepts of classes and inheritance in Python as they are crucial tools to help us take our games to the next level using Sprites and Sprite Groups.&nbsp; We will spend some time learning more intermediate concepts such as how to use sprites, sprite groups, and various sprite collision detection methods as we move onto making 2 intermediate level games.</p></li><li><p>The third portion of this course will focus on more advanced topics such as creating a tile map and using/reading it to create more complex level designs, using 2 dimensional vectors to aid with more complex player movement such as running and jumping under forces of friction and gravity, and adding character animations to make our games really come to life!&nbsp; We will use these more advanced concepts as well as all of our previous knowledge to make one last game that will be a great final project for you to show off!</p></li></ul><p>I'm really proud of this class.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really believe it not only is a great learning experience but it is also A&nbsp;LOT&nbsp;OF&nbsp;FUN!&nbsp; I hope you consider joining and taking part in the learning.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>New lectures added periodically to the course.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>In this course you will learn how to develop games using <strong>Godot</strong> and its own scripting language: <strong>GDScript.</strong> We will start by learning how to use the language and keep moving on until we learn how to <strong>export and publish </strong>our games, this way you'll not only learn how to create <strong>2D and 3D games</strong>, but also how to share them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Godot is an awesome <strong>open source</strong> engine that gives us the ability to create awesome 2D and 3D games and export them to the Web, Linux, Windows, OSX, Android and iOS with a single code base! Since its open source release, the engine keeps gaining space and grows more each day. Right now is an <strong>awesome time</strong> to learn this new engine and grow with it!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is <strong>based on projects</strong>, this way you won't just learn how to use the functionalities provided to us by Godot, but also apply them on complete games. At the end of most modules, you'll be given <strong>assignments</strong> so you can overcome problems on your own and apply what you've learned thought out all of the modules. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>All of the code and the projects</strong> created on the lectures are hosted on github repositories, this allows you to jump to any lecture by just downloading the project of the lecture and start from there, and compare your code to mine if you get stuck.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The assets used on the games are also provided to you so you don't have to spend any time looking for assets or creating them! </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To top it all off, we also have a facebook group where you can interact with me and other students. There, you'll be able to post the games you've created and feedback on them, as well as taking part on challenges of game development that I'll host from period to period.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Join now, you won't be disappointed!</strong><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>As a complete beginner, learning game development can be hard. My goal is that this course will make the process as fun and easy as possible!</strong></p><p>In just 6 hours, I'll teach you how to create an entire game without any prior game development experience. Throughout every video, I thoroughly explain the necessary systems we're using in a clear and comprehensive way, so that by the end of this course, you'll not only have completed a game, but you'll also have a foundational knowledge of Unreal Engine that you can use to start making games on your own.</p><p><strong><em>(Course owners will also get a free download for the project files I created for this series, that can be used for anything you like!)</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here’s everything that this course will cover.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Basics:</strong></p><p>I’ll teach you how to install UE5, make new projects, and edit levels with custom imported objects.</p><p><strong>Programing a Professional Player Character:</strong></p><p>We’ll add sprinting, customize our characters movement settings specifically to fit our game, then implement realistic, 3D sound effects and camera shake to enhance the games feel.</p><p><strong>Reusable Blueprints:</strong></p><p>Throughout the course I’ll show you how to create multiple Blueprints that you can reuse in all your levels, and easily set custom parameters for the important variables in them. We’ll be able to drag and drop these Blueprints to create full scale levels in just minutes. We’ll make things like subtitles, dangerous spikes, moving platforms, and pressure plates to activate them.</p><p>We’ll also create a dynamic item collection system, where the collectables are used to open the exit for each level. You’ll learn how to make systems that dynamically react to how many collectables are in your scene.</p><p><strong>Level Design and Creation:</strong></p><p>We’ll also take some time to go over a few basic level design principles, and draw out designs for each of our levels. After designing our levels, we’ll drag and drop our reusable Blueprints to construct every one super quickly and efficiently.</p><p>I’ll even teach some basic lighting and post processing systems that you can use to bring life to even the simplest scenes.</p><p><strong>Programing Menus using Widgets:</strong></p><p>After creating our levels, you’ll learn all about creating different kinds of menu, like a main menu where you can select levels you want to play, a pause screen that stops the game and allows users to return to the main menu, as well as a death screen and end screen.</p><p><strong>Polishing and Improvements:</strong></p><p>Once we’ve essentially finished our game, we’ll go back into our Blueprints, and make some tuning adjustments, bug fixes, and add extra sounds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Become a video game developer today, you won’t regret it!</strong></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course you will learn to use Control Rig in Unreal Engine 5, with a focus on <em>creating procedural animation systems</em>.<br><br><strong>This course is suitable for complete beginners</strong>, all the way through to professional animators and experienced game developers. It begins very slowly with detailed explanations and instructions to take you through creating procedural animation systems, which gives us a chance to explore and become familiar with various features of Control Rig.<br><br>After creating a procedural walk system, we take a general look at some useful features of Control Rig, and experiment with systems that allow you to create characters that interact with the environment and move realistically.<br><br>And finally we will create a procedural turn in place animation system, including troubleshooting, tweaking, and working through the logic step by step.<br><br><strong>The project file includes the completed versions of everything we create for Unreal Engine 5.2 and 5.3.</strong> This will be updated to include a 5.4 version when that version of the engine releases.</p><p><br>The techniques and methods explored are suitable for single player and multiplayer projects. <strong>The techniques used within Control Rig are also suitable for UEFN</strong>. This applies to the fully procedural sections and the specific functionalities we explore inside of Control Rig (at the time of writing animBP access is not available in&nbsp;UEFN, preventing a combination with keyframed animation - but the majority of the concepts will still work).</p><p><br></p><p>This information in this course is not available elsewhere, and is the result of many years of experimentation with Control Rig and procedural animation systems. My goal was to condense all of my experience with Control Rig into an easily digestible and understandable course, with explanations and diagrams at every step, so that you can learn a full mastery of how to use Control Rig for your own procedural and dynamic animations.</p><p><br>I look forward to seeing you on the course, and for you to share your creations and ideas. I'm always available for a discussion of concepts/ideas/help with any project, even if your specific use-case isn't covered directly in this course.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Unity's new Data-Oriented Technology Stack (<strong>DOTS</strong>) and Entity Component System (<strong>ECS</strong>) programming paradigm have been developed to optimize game development and open up new ways of accessing memory and parallel processing for developing high-performance C# code that takes advantage of contemporary multicore computers. Through the use of the <strong>Burst Compiler</strong>, your game programs become native code, able to run faster on multiple threads thus pushing the boundaries of the size of your virtual environments and the simultaneous processing of tens of thousands of game objects.</p><p>In this course, Penny demystifies Unity's new DOTS architecture and introduces intermediate Unity users to ECS by upgrading classic Unity projects and developing a multitude of examples of the use of DOTS concentrating on the most popular game mechanics. Using her internationally acclaimed teaching style and&nbsp;knowledge from over 25 years working with games,&nbsp;graphics and having written two award-winning books on games AI, Penny will take you from familiar object-oriented programming and upgrade your skill to the more memory efficient and optimized entity component architecture.&nbsp;Throughout, you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to take you through every step of becoming familiar with ECS.&nbsp; You will build on numerous scenarios that examine the basics of ECS programming through the new DOTS-specific math and physics libraries.</p><p>While DOTS is still in preview, this course aims to assist you in understanding how it works and how games are constructed with it.&nbsp; The knowledge you obtain will further your ability to decipher future released Unity ECS tech demos and handle API updates.</p><p>This course requires <strong>Unity 2019.3.0f6</strong>. and the <strong>Hybrid Renderer Package 0.3.3</strong>.</p><p><strong>Learn how to program and work with:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Entities and Components</p></li><li><p>The C# Job Systems</p></li><li><p>Collision Systems</p></li><li><p>Trigger Systems</p></li><li><p>User Input to Control Entities</p></li><li><p>Interfacing with classic Unity and game objects to entity-based systems.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Contents and Overview</strong></p><p>The course begins with a section that compares the old way of working with game objects in Unity, through to the creation of a complete ECS system using the exact same scenario in each instance to give you time to compare the programming methods and optimizations gained through implementing DOTS.</p><p>Following this, you will dive deeper into the creation and debugging of entities while learning how to tag, identify and add data to them with custom components.&nbsp; You will also learn how to find entities once they are injected into the game environment and to access and manipulate them at runtime.</p><p>After you've become comfortable with the nature of entities, you will discover how the new math library can be used to replicate many of the functions you've become familiar with in the Unity Mathf API.&nbsp; The content will cover transformation, rotations, slerps, pivoting, following waypoints and pursuing and fleeing from targets.&nbsp; A space-based scenario will be created with several planets and thousands of spacecraft programmed to attack, by generating even more thousands of bullets and finally explosions.</p><p>Next, you'll build a blocky Minecraft inspired landscape from cubes that can be infinitely generated in any direction by implementing Perlin Noise and examining how parallel processing (achieved through the C# Jobs system) dramatically speeds up processing that has in the past been limited to the main thread.</p><p>On completion of this exercise, a thorough examination of the new DOTS physics capabilities will take place.&nbsp; All the classic Unity elements you've become used to will be replicated via the new physics API and ECS job systems.&nbsp; You will learn about collisions, triggers, camera tracking, bullet physics and the basics of recreating Newtonian physics for moving dynamic and kinematic entities.</p><p>The course ends with a challenge and project to recreate a third person shooter in which a single player takes on a swarm of zombies.</p><p>At the completion of this course, you will be familiar with DOTS and the ECS and be able to further your skills by interpreting and making sense of the Unity tech demos as they are released, presenting updated API and introducing more and more functionality into DOTS.</p><p><strong>What students are saying about Penny's courses:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Excellent course!! I am already in game development industry and there is one quote here that \"Whenever you are not able to solve complex problem, its the right time to get back to the BASICS\"</em></p></li><li><p><em>She is the best teacher ever in this platform</em></p></li><li><p><em>Most instructors are very smart people. Some are good at teaching and some are not. Penny is great at describing complex concepts without going down a dark cerebral rabbit hole that so many instructors feel obligated to do. It's like they need to demonstrate their knowledge by explaining every tiny aspect. Penny does not go there. She explains things clearly but does not overwhelm the student with more than they need to know. </em></p></li></ul><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><em>Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) </em>is an AI architecture that provides game characters with the ability to select goals and make plans to achieve those goals based on the state of the environment and available resources.&nbsp; It can be used across a wide range of game genres from first-person shooters to real-time strategies, to develop intelligent characters capable of making smart decisions without the need for large finite state machines.&nbsp; &nbsp;The codebase is deceptively simple and yet logical, reusable and extremely powerful.&nbsp; The library is written in <strong>C# </strong>and implemented in <strong>Unity V.2019</strong>,<strong> </strong>however will easily port to other applications.</p><p>The projects in this course have been tested with and work in <strong>Unity 6</strong>.</p><p>In this course, Penny demystifies the advanced AI technique of GOAP used for creating believable and intelligent game characters in games&nbsp;using her internationally acclaimed teaching style and&nbsp;knowledge from over 25 years working with games,&nbsp;graphics and having written two award-winning books on games AI.&nbsp;Throughout, you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to take you through every step of putting together your own GOAP API.&nbsp; You will build the entire GOAP library from the ground up while building a <em>hospital simulation scenario</em> in parallel, to test the API as you go.</p><p><strong>Learn how to program and work with:</strong></p><ul><li><p>A GOAP Library and API that's reusable across a wide range of game projects.</p></li><li><p>Goals, Actions, States and Beliefs that define the state of the game environment, what individual characters want to do and how they understand their world.</p></li><li><p>Navigation Meshes and Agents that provide advanced path planning and navigation capabilities for characters.</p></li><li><p>Dynamic Building of NavMeshes to allow for the repositioning of resources in the environment.</p></li><li><p>Inventories for each character for use in completing tasks that satisfy character goals.</p></li><li><p>The Unity UI system to move draggable resources into a game environment.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Contents and Overview</strong></p><p>Throughout the course, you will follow along while a GOAP library and API are constructed from the ground up, to allow you intimate knowledge of the codebase.&nbsp; Alongside this, a simple hospital simulation will be constructed to test out the functionality of the library as it is put together.&nbsp; The simulation will also rely on Unity's NavMesh System for navigation and path planning.</p><p>The course begins with an overview of Unity's NavMesh System and covers the basic functionality needed for the hospital simulation.&nbsp; It then goes on to cover the concept of GOAP, where students will discover how goals, actions and plans interact.&nbsp; A planner will be constructed that dynamically builds each character's sequence of actions, based on what they believe their goals are while in the simulation.</p><p>Following this, inventories will be introduced and developed to hold resources for individual characters.&nbsp; The resources in the inventories will be required for plan completion and also assist in directing a character's navigation around the environment.&nbsp; This will then build to the design of more complex behaviours in which two characters must collaborate to complete a plan.&nbsp; </p><p>As the course continues, more characters with differing roles will be added and dynamically created and resources will be added and removed to develop a complex simulation.&nbsp; By the end of the course, students will have a hospital simulation with patients, nurses, doctors and janitors each with their own roles, goals, actions and required resources.&nbsp; </p><p>Although this course is not about building a completed game, a final section will provide some further knowledge on Unity development and examine methods for interacting with the environment such as: dragging and dropping items, dynamic NavMesh baking, user interface creation and camera movement to provide students with some direction on how such a simulation could be turned into a game.</p><p>At the completion of this course, students will have a fully-fledged GOAP library and API that they can reuse in their own game projects to provide game characters with complex intelligent behaviours.</p><p><strong>What students are saying about Penny's courses:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Turns out, the hardest part of this course for me is finding the words to describe how glad I am to have enrolled in it.</em></p></li><li><p><em>I honestly love Hollistic's teaching approach and I've never learned so much within a few hours about coding effectively with such detailed explanations!</em></p></li><li><p><em>Penny is an excellent instructor and she does a great job of breaking down complex concepts into smaller, easy-to-understand topics.</em></p></li></ul><p><br></p>",

The genre mixes racing and arcade type mechanics with well-known fictional characters and funky tracks littered with pickups and obstacles. Creating such a game combines the skills of networking, artificial intelligence, interface design, special effects and audio.</p><p>In this course, Penny reveals the most popular AI techniques used for creating NPC racing character behaviour in games&nbsp;using her internationally acclaimed teaching style and&nbsp;knowledge from over 25 years working with games,&nbsp;graphics and having written two award-winning books on games AI.&nbsp;Throughout, you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to take you through every step of putting together your own kart racing game.&nbsp; You will first construct from scratch a single-player experience with intelligent NPC components and then add on networking functionality with a Photon master server to create a multiplayer game.</p><p><strong>Learn how to program and work with:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Car physics and controllers built from the ground up with Unity's wheel colliders and rigid bodies;</p></li><li><p>AI driven cars with waypoint navigation, smart acceleration &amp; braking and avoidance behaviours;</p></li><li><p>Race Track Mini-maps with Player positions, rear view cameras and leaderboards;</p></li><li><p>Networking with Photon including setting up a master server, remote procedure calls and networked object instantiation;</p></li><li><p>Character selection for vehicle types and player names; and</p></li><li><p>Graphical User Interfaces.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Contents and Overview</strong></p><p>The course begins with a detailed explanation of Unity's vehicle physics system.&nbsp; A four-wheeled car will be constructed from scratch using wheel colliders and rigid bodies in which every setting is explored and all possible functionality tested and put through its paces to get the right balance of skid, acceleration, braking and weight. This system will then be transferred to a top quality Kart model and placed in a racing track environment in which artificial intelligence mechanics will be added to develop non-player character vehicles who can effectively drive around the track while avoiding or in some cases aggressively bumping other players.</p><p>You will work your way up to a completed kart racing single player game in which one player takes on three NPCs.&nbsp; Race places will be calculated and a heads-up display (HUD) containing a rear view camera, minimap and player leaderboard will be added.&nbsp; You'll also learn how to implement a camera-following script that you can use to switch between players for differing points of view.</p><p>Once the single player game is completed, the Photon API will be used to set up a master server and then add multiplayer functionality to the game so you can then play it with your friends.&nbsp; You will learn how to create your own server, send remote procedure calls to other players and instantiate networked objects, some of them AI characters.</p><p>At the completion of this course you will have covered a wide variety of game development techniques from artificial intelligence, networking and user interface creation.&nbsp; The knowledge and skills you acquire will be applicable across numerous game genres and stand you in good stead for adding advanced functionality to your own game projects.</p><p><strong>What students are saying about Penny's courses:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Dr.Penny is a wonderful person and a true expert. All of her courses I've taken have been top notch and in my opinion there is no better teacher out there. Her upbeat personality makes you feel as if you're listening to a friend than just another monotone teacher.</p></li><li><p>This is my first course I've ever bought for Unity as I've tinkered for years with Unity and not really done anything , but I'm only 27% through the course and I've already learned so many new things, it's really opened my eyes to the power of Unity. I've followed Penny for a while now on YouTube and she is a brilliant instructor, very clear on the code you're writing and explaining how it all works.</p></li><li><p>I really appreciate the clarity. I've had many dabblings with learning how to code previously and have found my knowledge comes and goes. This time around, the concepts are really sticking. There is something to the Holistic3D method!</p></li></ul><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>\"The videos are great and the course is interactive. Some of the things have been updated but the community and the instructor is very helpful a must buy for me.\"</strong></p><p>\"This was a very nice course. Almost sad to have reached the end of it... Each mini-game section starts out from the beginning, like it was the first section of the course, so that makes it nice if you want to jump around and program a certain game first. It's not like each one builds on knowledge from the prior one, though after you've done a few, you start to know how the initial setup is going to go. </p><p><strong>It's also nice that you build everything - from the code to the art. I enjoyed creating my own 3-D artwork in Blender - much nicer than just being handed meshes by the instructor. Instructors are very thorough in their explanations.\" - Dave J.</strong></p><p>\"The amount of detail that has gone into explaining the basics of coding is amazing, truly a great example of teaching.\" </p><p><strong>\"I couldn't come up with a way for this course to be better. This is among the very best I have bought on Udemy.\"</strong></p><p>\"The videos are great and the course is interactive . Some of the things have been updated but the community and the instructor is very helpful a must buy for me.\" - Rivek Tamang</p><p><strong>\"Best Unity3d course I have taken so far.... not only you learn Unity , you learn Blender as well. Thank you for such awesome course.\" - Akash Kumar</strong><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Have you ever wanted to make your very own virtual reality games? Well, you've come to the right place!</p><p>After purchasing this course, you'll be taken step-by-step through every process needed to do just that. Our two very talented instructors, Kevin Liao and Glauco Pires, explain everything from a basic, beginner level. That means, you don't have to have any prior coding or digital art experience to succeed here.</p><p>**This course covers the Google cardboard and not higher end VR headsets like the HTC Vive. It will help you regardless as we do show many techniques for building VR games that are still applicable.</p><p>In the first section of each tutorial, Glauco Pires will take you through the process of coding the game in Unity® 5.4.3f1 from scratch. The second section of the tutorial will teach you how to create all the artistic elements you will need to complete the game. Kevin Liao will teach this section of the course in Blender; the wonderful, free 3D modeling program.</p><p>The final section will teach you how to integrate the art you created in Blender to the game in Unity 5.4.3f1. Glauco will take this part.</p><p>The beauty of taking an online course like this is the ability to replay any of the lectures at any time. There is no time limit or final tests. You get to learn at your own pace with a practical model method of learning. This course mostly focuses on mobile VR Development. This is because, it is the easiest to develop for and will most widely adopted. </p><p><strong>\"Great course. Definitely learned a lot about how an overall project can come together in Unity. I found the material easy to follow and well constructed. The instructor covers theory and implementation, and it is deep, with real app examples, outstanding.\"</strong></p><p><strong>\"I like how everything is being explained on a very basic level. Easy to follow, I would imagine, for anyone without any modeling experience. Good job guys, and thanks!\"</strong></p><p><strong>\"Very good. Very comprehensive and easy to follow. Can't wait for the other courses to learn more.\" - Yashim W.</strong></p><p><strong>We hope you decide to purchase this course and take your knowledge to the next level!</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to <strong>\"Unreal Engine 5 C++: Advanced Action RPG\"</strong>! The most comprehensive RPG course you'll ever find online. In this course, we'll employ i<strong>ndustry-standard coding practices</strong> and <strong>data-oriented design</strong> to create <strong>AAA</strong> RPG combat experiences.</p><p><br></p><p>You'll learn how to use <strong>Gameplay Ability System</strong> to create a complex RPG combat experience and implement exciting features like a combo system with light and heavy attacks, directional rolling, hit reactions, blocking, parrying, target locking, special abilities with cooldowns, AI avoidance, advanced enemy AI with strafing and projectile attacks, an epic boss fight, and much more. </p><p><br></p><p>In the first section, we’ll set up our hero character for the gameplay ability system and proceed with input binding using native gameplay tags and data assets. Once our character can navigate the level, we’ll combine GAS with linked animation layers to create a melee combo system featuring light and heavy attacks. With these elements in place, we’ll introduce enemy characters, adding attributes, combat feedback, character death, and a robust UI notification system. You’ll also learn to use asynchronous loading for startup data and create a custom function library for handling damage.</p><p><br></p><p>Next, we’ll implement AI avoidance and strafing using a blend of Blueprint and C++ behavior tree nodes to craft advanced AI behaviors. We’ll incorporate the crowd following component for detour crowd avoidance and explore behavior tree node types and the environment query system to determine strafing locations.</p><p><br></p><p>With our enemies capable of dealing damage, we’ll refine our hero’s combat abilities by adding directional rolling, directional hit reactions, blocking, parrying, and target locking. You’ll learn to use motion warping for dynamic rolling distances and handle most of the heavy lifting in C++ for the target lock ability.</p><p><br></p><p>Following this, we’ll introduce a ranged enemy that shoots projectiles and retreats when approached. We’ll then add a boss character complete with a boss bar, powerful melee attacks, and the ability to summon other enemies. Once our combat system is fully functional, we’ll develop a survival game mode with enemy waves. We’ll create multiple widgets, including a win screen, lose screen, pause menu, and main menu. Finally, we’ll port everything to a real map for epic battles against our enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>This comprehensive RPG course is unmatched online. With detailed code changes provided in each lecture and a step-by-step approach, there’s no better time to create your dream RPG project. What are you waiting for? Join the course and start your RPG adventure today!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>What is Phaser?</strong></p><p>Phaser is a framework for creating HTML-based games in Javascript. It’s very simple to use and get started with. It provides a full set of features to create professional games ready to be published on different platforms. Such as Facebook Instant Games, IOS, or Android platforms.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is in the course?</strong></p><p>During this course, you will acquire hands-on experience in developing three games entirely from scratch. The games include a clone of Flappy Bird, a well-known Dino game from Google Chrome, and a custom Platformer game. No shortcuts will be taken throughout the course, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the development process. The curriculum encompasses JavaScript, with an added section dedicated to creating a game using TypeScript.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is designed to teach you how to create your own games from scratch using Javascript and the Phaser framework. Through a series of practical exercises, you will learn how to develop games that are engaging, challenging, and fun. By the end of the course, you will have created your own games that can be published on Facebook Instant Games.</p><p><br></p><p>The course will cover a range of important concepts in game development, including how to initialize the Phaser Game, manipulate physical concepts like gravity and velocity, create and recycle game objects, and use multiple scenes like menu, score, pause, and play. You will also learn how to create difficulty systems and keep track of scores.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to these foundational concepts, the course will also teach you how to create more complex games like platformers. You will learn how to use the Tiled editor to design maps and levels, create different types of attacks like melee and projectile attacks, and animate game objects like characters and enemies. We will also cover advanced concepts like Raycasting, which will allow you to detect enemies and traps, and create a health system that triggers game over when health reaches zero.</p><p><br></p><p>The final project of the course will be to create a multi-level platformer game. You will learn how to unlock levels and display credits once the player reaches the end of the game. Throughout the course, you will gain valuable experience that can be applied to other game development platforms like Unity or Unreal Engine.</p><p><br></p><p>In conclusion, this course offers an extensive and practical introduction to game development with Javascript and the Phaser framework. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you will gain valuable insights and skills that will enable you to create your own engaging and fun games.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>*** Enroll Now And Learn How To Create Your Own Candy Crush Style Game And Angry Birds Style Game From Scratch ***</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>*** THIS COURSE IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS, so make sure you have a prior knowledge of Unity game development and programming before you join this course ***</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A sequel to our Mastering 2D Games In Unity: Build 6 Fully Featured Games From Scratch Course!!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As a sequel to a course that already covers the basics of Unity and C#, in this course we are going to take it straight to the point, so if you are a complete beginner we do advise you to take a look at our other course which will help you understand unity and game development.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As always we are using practical approaches in teaching game development, so in this course we are going to build 6 games from scratch!!!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pin The Circle Game</strong><br><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are going to start with a simple game called Pin The Circle. In the game we have a circle that is rotating and we need to shoot all our needles in the circle but we must avoid touching other needles in that process. We are going to create a main menu for the game, implement shooting mechanics, spawn a specific number of game objects for a specific level, and see how can we effortlessly create levels for our game in order to make it challenging to our players.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jump Hero Game</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Moving forward with a more complicated game we are going to create a game called Jump Hero. In this game we have platforms on which our hero stands, and he needs to jump from one to another in order to progress through our game. We get one point if we land on a platform without falling down. We are going to see how can we implement the players jump, how can we spawn new platforms for the player to jump and how can we move the camera to the next platform in order for our player to see the next platform and jump on it. We are also going to implement a main menu and a player died panel which is going to show us our score when player dies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Basketball Shoot Game</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The next game is even more complicated and its called Basketball Shoot. In the game we have a basketball which we are going to shoot by dragging our mouse or our finger on the screen and we need to score a point in order to progress in the game. We are going to implement main menu and ball select system which will allows us to chose one of the multiple balls that we have in the game. When we drag our ball we are going to create a projectile path which is going to show us where our ball is going to land when we release our button and we are also going to implement a ball scoring system.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Puzzle Game</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Next we are going to create a puzzle game where we are going to slice an image that we import and then we are going to shuffle the pieces of that image so that we form a puzzle. The player will be able to move the puzzle pieces left, right, up and down in order to rearrange them in the correct order so that he can form a whole image.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Angry Birds Style Game</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After that we are going to create the good old Angry Birds game. We are going to see how can we shoot our birds to hit the bad piggies and score points. We are going to see how can we implement a slightly different technique in order to draw the projectile path and we are going to see how can we implement the game mechanics for our Angry Birds Game.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Candy Crush Style Game</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And finally we are going to create a Candy Crush Clone game. We are going to implement the mechanics of matching 3 equal items in order to score in our game and destroy the matched candies. We are going to use two dimensional arrays to position our candies in the game, and we are going to see how can we implement different algorithms in order to find the equal matches. We are going to implement a nice main menu and a score system which will reward our player when he crushes 3 or more candies, and if he crushes more than 3 candies we are going to give him a bonus candy which will crush a whole row or column when its crushed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You will also benefit from my super fast response if you have any issue that you are stuck with(I check Udemy forums every day if someone posts a question).

  "description": "<p>This course is a deep dive into Unity's UI Toolkit. You will learn most of the components that make up UI Toolkit and be able to create complex UI Systems for your games or apps.&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>This course uses a mix of theory and practice. We will create <strong>dozens of little UI-Components</strong> and examples. Furthermore, we will have a <strong>course project</strong> on which we will practice what we learned in the particular chapters. <strong>Finally, we will bring it all together and create a fully functional UI-based game. </strong></p><p>While this course is not explicitly covering Editor Scripting most of the content in the course will also apply to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Here are some of the topics that we will cover:<br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Understanding UXML and USS Files</strong></p><p>Understand the basic building blocks of UI Toolkit. We will talk about the concept of a visual tree and why it's a good idea to separate structure, styling and behavior.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Layouts with FLEXBOX</strong></p><p>UI Toolkit uses the Flexbox system which is also used in web technologies.</p><p> </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Templates</strong></p><p>We will learn how we can reuse pieces of our layout with templates.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Events and Event Propagation</strong></p><p>No UI System can function without events. UI Toolkit has its own Event-System with modern features like event-propagation which we can use to our advantage.<strong><br></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>UQuery</strong></p><p>Unity is still a game engine, so more often than not most of your work will be done through scripts. U need an efficient way to connect your scripts and your UI and manipulate certain elements of your UI. In order to do that you first need to find those elements. UQuery provides a comfortable way how you can do that.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Data Binding</strong></p><p>While for editor scripting there is already a system in place which helps you bind your data to your components, this is not the case for runtime. Therefore we will look at some tools and techniques how you can do this manually.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Custom Components</strong></p><p>UI Toolkit has a library of several build-in controls, but obviously, those can not cover every use case that you might come across. In this section, we will see how to create our own controls and thereby create our own little library of reusable UI Elements.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Manipulators</strong></p><p>One rule of good software development is the separation of concerns. In this section, we will learn how we can group the behavior of particular elements into manipulators.</p><p><br></p><p>and much more...</p><p><br></p>",

In doing so, this course will give you a robust exposure to many aspects of the Godot engine from C# scripting, to input handling, to tile maps, to saving and loading data, to audio, and more. By the time you complete this course, you will feel comfortable working on your own projects in Godot 4.3+&nbsp;and C#. You will walk away from this course with a solid foundational understanding of making games that are not only functional but also fun.</p><p>This course will help you greatly if:</p><ul><li><p>You are ready to dive into a crash course for Godot 4.3+ with C#</p></li><li><p>You are comfortable in Unity and want to transfer your C#&nbsp;scripting skills to Godot</p></li><li><p>You have some game development knowledge and want to learn Godot</p></li><li><p>You have some programming knowledge and want to make games</p></li><li><p>You struggle to complete games and want to start and finish a project</p></li></ul><p>Please note that this course is focused purely on the start-to-finish process of making a grid-based puzzle game. With that goal in mind, there is no time spent explaining fundamental programming concepts of statically typed languages. Familiarity with programming and statically typed languages is strongly recommended before taking this course.</p><p>Several lessons are available to for you to preview for free. Please take a look at those videos before enrolling to determine if the pace of this course is right for you!</p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course you will learn how to use the very popular Pygame module by coding a dungeon crawler game completely from scratch. Since this is a Python module, we will also cover a lot of the fundamentals of Python in the process. This will include different types of loops, lists and even working with files on the computer.</p><p>The course will cover the fundamentals such as the game loop, keyboard inputs and drawings shapes and images onto the screen. This will give an introduction to Pygame and a refresher of Python if you haven’t used it in a while.</p><p>After that the course will move onto more advanced topics such as animation and level tilemaps.</p><p>We will also tackle AI within this project, by gradually building up layers of intelligence for the enemies, starting with simpler logic, such as having the enemies always run towards the player, to more advanced logic, where the enemies need to see the player before they can chase him.</p><p>The course includes a set of starter files to help you get the folder structure setup correctly from the beginning. Additionally, I have included my custom level editor so you can edit the levels and even create your own ones to add to the game.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Ever wanted to make your very own multiplayer games? The free Unity Game Engine is making the process easier than it has been with its Netcode For GameObjects (NGO) framework.</p><p>In this course we'll create a multiplayer top-down shooter that you can modify and turn into your own fun creation and play against <strong>20 or more people simultaneously online</strong>. In the process you'll learn how to create and deploy a dedicated server with matchmaking.</p><p>We’ll be making a .io style game (like slither .io and agar .io), that can accommodate dozens of players. Through that process you’ll <strong>build the skills to make your own competitive or cooperative multiplayer game in any genre</strong> that interests you.</p><p>You’ll learn about networking and how to make the game a multiplayer.

  "description": "<p>For the last 5 years I have been working with the <strong>team at Unity</strong> to create learning resources for them including e-books. Using this insider knowledge I bring you <strong>the best Unity Shader course</strong> you can find. <strong>All updated for Unity 6</strong>. Including <strong>URP shaders and Shader Graph</strong>. </p><p>With <strong>Unity 6</strong> the <strong>Universal Render Pipeline (URP) is now the default pipeline</strong>. This course shows you how to create shaders for URP either using code or if you are <strong>not a coder using Shader Graph</strong>. Putting you right at the <strong>cutting edge</strong>. </p><p>In this course we're going to look at<strong> </strong>using<strong> HLSL shading language </strong>to create <strong>amazing shaders</strong>. </p><p>Maybe you are</p><ul><li><p>a developer struggling to bring to life a particular <strong>game feature</strong> because it needs a <strong>custom shader</strong>.</p></li><li><p>a developer who always wanted to create custom shaders but was too <strong>scared to start</strong>. </p></li><li><p>a developer wanting to add some <strong>custom post-processing effects</strong> to your 3d renders.</p></li><li><p>an artist wanting to create shaders <strong>without learning to code</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>HLSL code syntax is based on the C language, but fear not, we will assume you have literally no knowledge of this language at all and we will, as the course title states, learn this from scratch. A shader uses the <strong>GPU</strong> ( the Graphics Processing Unit) to handle multiple programs at the same time, so <strong>it is unbelievably fast</strong>. </p><p>We will start from really simple examples and progress slowly through each stage of developing a custom shader. You will be able to play with the shader code using Visual Studio, or another code editor if you prefer. You can <strong>experiment with different values </strong>to see the impact it has on the end result. </p><p>Unity shaders are split into <strong>vertex shaders</strong> and <strong>fragment shaders</strong> and we will focus initially on the fragment shader, working essentially in a 2d environment. With <strong>dozens of shaders in the course resources</strong> you will learn the language in <strong>gentle stages</strong>. Before moving on to use Unity's <strong>surface shader syntax</strong> to easily include complex lighting.</p><p>Once you're comfortable with simple shaders we will cover <strong>advanced effects</strong> such as tessellation, transparency, using the stencil buffer and post-processing.</p><p>Creating your own shaders means<strong> understanding</strong> the <strong>HLSL language</strong> and that is the <strong>aim of the course</strong>. You could search for a suitable shader on ShaderToy or ShaderFrog and then try to adapt the code. But without knowing the language you're going to find that difficult to do. To <strong>really be effective</strong> you need to know about the&nbsp; language, shaping functions, tiling and lighting calculations. To do this you will need to follow along with the course and complete the <strong>many challenges</strong> suggested. At the end you will then be able to create any shader that you can imagine. </p><p><br></p><p>As usual there is a <strong>30 day money back guarantee</strong>. So you have nothing to lose. <strong>Let's get shading today</strong>! </p><p><br></p><p>What students say about the course</p><p>\"<strong>Great course</strong>. Took this as a refresher to get back into shaders. <strong>Everything you need is provided</strong>. Both starting scenes for each lecture and also completed ones if you get stuck with code errors. <strong>Nice learning curve</strong>. Everything is well explained. No long boring slideshows. Also plenty of challenges, which I like and find very useful in assisting your learning. <strong>Very clear audio and code</strong>. So no problems following along and plenty to take in. Also Nicholas is very helpful with your Q&amp;A’s. <strong>Highly recommended</strong>.\"</p><p>\"The information presented in this <strong>course is fantastic</strong>. The tutor has a <strong>great personality</strong>, and I can’t stress enough how <strong>enjoyable </strong>he makes this course.\"</p><p>\"<strong>It is fantastic</strong>. You need a little bit of math to understand it better but with attention and repetition it will be <strong>easy to anyone</strong>. Thanks a lot professor!\"</p><p>\"<strong>Exceptional good structured step by step course</strong>. Background knowledge is provided on spot when necessary. Nik has a special encouraging attitude and he is <strong>fun to listen to</strong>. Thanks!\"</p><p>\"The <strong>best shaders instructor I've seen so far</strong>. His lessons are clear, practical, and the way he talks <strong>keeps the student motivated</strong> with the right amount of humour but without losing focus! I'm glad I've found this course.\"</p><p>\"I would say that this was the <strong>best course</strong> I have bought on Udemy so far.\"</p><p>\"If you’re looking to dive deep into Unity shaders, <strong>this course is a goldmine</strong>. Nicholas walks you through the fundamentals and pushes you to try new things, which makes learning feel <strong>much more rewarding</strong>.\"</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to <strong>Learn C# and make a videogame with Unity 2020 : beginner to pro. </strong></p><p>If you are here, it is probably because you like video games and want to learn how to make your own video games. In addition, it is likely that you know how to draw pictures, design your own characters, your enemies, animations, scenarios, have thought out game mechanics, ... but you lack one thing:<strong> KNOW HOW TO PROGRAM!</strong></p><p>You don't have to be ashamed. I myself did not create my first video game until I was 23 years old and since then, I had been studying mathematics. No one is born taught and that is why we are here: so that <strong>you can learn to make your own video game in Unity&nbsp; with the C# (c sharp)&nbsp; programming language</strong>, a simple language that is easy to learn, and that will give you many possibilities to expand your knowledge.</p><p>In this course, we will start with the basics and fundamentals: <strong>programming</strong>. Programming is like the language of computers. Right now you and I communicate in a common language: English, which we both understand perfectly and that is why we can be exchanging information: I write and you read. Probably if I were writing this to you in French or German, then you wouldn't even understand what I am telling you, not because it is easier or more difficult, but because I would be using a different language. Computers and mobile devices themselves have their own language, their jargon, their slang. That is where we will begin our learning path together, young Padawan: by learning what a program is, how it manages to communicate with the graphic part, and how we, by pressing an arrow or a button, can make the computer understand what we want to say . We are going to learn together basic programming aspects such as:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>• Variables and data types</strong></p><p><strong>• Methods or code snippets</strong></p><p><strong>• Object and object-oriented programming</strong></p><p><strong>• Decision operators</strong></p><p><strong>• Collections, arrays, and object lists </strong></p><p><strong>• The iteration operators</strong></p><p><br></p><p>With all this, it will be like the cook who leaves the academy and has been taught to peel, cut, cook, boil, season, season ... food. But even if we know how to fry an egg, we all know that fried eggs made by us, by our mothers, or by our grandmothers do not taste the same. Therefore, once we know the tools and basic principles of programming, we will put them into practice with a real project, our first<strong> 2D video game</strong>: a 2D platform where the objective will be to dodge enemies while collecting the maximum number of coins. It will be a simple video game but we will see its true potential in everything that can really be done from what we know:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>• We will learn how to plan the Game Design and to split up the development stages of our video game</strong></p><p><strong>• We will learn what a prefab is and how they are used to create scenes for a video game</strong></p><p><strong>• We will create our own menus and the game information HUD</strong></p><p><strong>• We will learn typical mechanics and gameplay such as infinite scrolling or the physics of a video game</strong></p><p><br></p><p>And really with all this, believe it or not,<strong> you will have made your first video game !!!</strong> I would also like you to introduce yourself when you start, say where you come from and what knowledge of video game development you have, and share in the course's forum what type of video game you would like to make. Please refrain from impossibilities like \"I want to make a Dark Souls, a Witcher, a Metal Gear\" and so on. These games have studies of more than 400 expert developers and we are looking to get started. The goal is for you to make your first video game, and as such, it should be an achievable and easy goal to carry out so you don't get discouraged.</p><p>Well, I've already warmed up and I'm looking forward to<strong> learning C #</strong> together and starting to create our<strong> videogame in Unity</strong>. So don't think twice and sign up now to start your career as a <strong>video game developer with Unity 2020 and C #</strong>.</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course will introduce you to modern OpenGL programming.  We will teach you a brief history of OpenGL to help you understand why we chose to teach modern OpenGL with its programmable rendering pipeline over the fixed function pipeline. The majority of tutorials and books only teach the outdated versions of OpenGL API with its fixed function pipeline. We will show you how to use the faster, more efficient and more flexible OpenGL API.<br></p>\n\n<p>We begin with the basics of getting OpenGL running in a window using the GLFW library.  Then we will move on to understanding the basics of rendering polygons to the display by sending buffers of data to the computers graphics card and programming it using shaders with the GLSL shading language.  We learn how to map textures to our objects. We'll set up a virtual camera using keyboard and mouse inputs to enable us to move around in the scene.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After we have the fundamentals working then we can start building more complex things.  We will learn how to load 3D models and add interesting lighting to the scene.  By the end of this course, you will know how to set up and render in 3D with modern OpenGL.  With each lesson we build the framework with reusable C++ and OpenGL code.  That is a great starting place for you to build your own game engine.  We will start with a blank project and write code each step of the way and each lesson builds upon the last.  Even if you have never touched OpenGL you should find the course easy to follow and everything explained along the way.\n\n  All of the source code, pre-built third party libraries and Visual Studio solutions for each lesson are included.</p>",

  "description": "<p>What do you think optimisation of a game project is? Do you think it's writing really efficient code or getting your game to run as fast as possible? Is it a task you do days before release or from the very start?&nbsp; Not sure where to start? Well, this course is for you.</p><p>Designed for INTERMEDIATE level Unity and C# students, the content within will forge you into an optimization expert. Without even thinking, you'll be pulling up the Unity profiler and investigating CPU and GPU bottlenecks like a pro. You'll find hints and tips on improving the performance of your game starting with the script and moving onto art assets and finally physics. There are plenty of hands-on exercises designed to give you skills in forensic debugging that will be valuable to you far into the future.</p><p>This course uses <strong>Unity 2020.2 or 2020.3</strong> but is also compatible with<strong> Unity 6.</strong></p><p><strong>You will learn about:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Performance Budgets</p></li><li><p>The Unity Profiler</p></li><li><p>C# Optimisation Tricks for the Unity API</p></li><li><p>Art asset optimisation settings</p></li><li><p>Audio file usage and settings</p></li><li><p>Tips and tricks for getting more from the Unity Physics system</p></li></ul><p>What people are saying about Penny's courses:</p><ul><li><p><em>A great and engaging course that teaches you a lot about the Unity Profiler which is key to optimising the games. It is a valuable skill that people look for. It's in a tutorial format which is my preferred method of learning.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Allow me to say how hugely important this is for a person who is interested in certain types of game design. Creating games where you can create AI behaviors that support emergent situations.</em></p></li><li><p><em> I honestly love Holistic's teaching approach and I've never learned so much within a few hours about coding effectively with such detailed explanations!</em></p></li></ul><p>This course focuses on developing student skills in identifying and solving performance issues in their game development projects.&nbsp; By the end, they will find the use of the Unity Profiler second nature and be able to identify many CPU and GPU bottlenecks in their's and other's Unity projects.</p>",

  "description": "\n\n<p>In this course we will be going through the process of creating a small stylized dungeon environment from the blockout stage to the final presentation. I will be guiding you through the process of modeling the low poly assets and show you different techniques of UVing. We will then take our assets into ZBrush where I will be showing how to define all the materials that you will find in this environment. We will use some of the ZBrush sculpts to render tiling texture flats that we can composite in Photoshop. I will then be guiding you through the process of painting the textures for a few assets so you can reproduce this process for the remaining models. Finally, we are going to set up a scene in Marmoset for the final presentation. By the end of this course, you should be able to create and understand the workflow that I use to create stylized environments like this one.</p><p><strong>(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)</strong></p>\n\n<p>More about the Instructor:</p>\n\n<p>Tobias Koepp is an accomplished environment artist in the  games industry. He started his career as a student in the Netherlands where he  had the chance to work as an intern at Guerilla Games for about half a year. He is now currently working on his first full-time job as a 3D artist at an  outsourcing studio in Spain. I’ve always been fascinated by hand painted and  stylized art and work hard to turn this passion into a job.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Start programming professional code for your Games</strong></p><p>If you want to create your first Games the Unity - Engine and C# are the right tools for the job. The Unity - Engine is used by many successful Indie and Triple-A Titles and this course is the best way to get a fundamental understanding of Unity and the C# programming language. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Create Games the way you imagine them</strong></p><p>Most Hobby-Gamedevelopers struggle with the Programming-Aspect their games and thus are very limited in what mechanics they can implement. </p><p>My goal is to unleash your creative freedom by giving you the tools you need to code the games you want to code with Unity and C#. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>By the end of this course you will have programmed at least a Console-Game, an Obstacle-Course and a Shoot em up.</strong></p><p>I am a devout follower of a practical approach to programming.&nbsp; So this course will be primarily <strong>project-based. </strong>You won't just learn dry theory and forget everything within a matter of days but instead apply the learned concepts with practical exercises and projects within the Unity - Engine and C#.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What makes me qualified to teach you?</strong></p><p>My name is Andreas Metz and I have a Master's Degree in Science for educating Computer Science &amp; Psychology. I have been teaching Game-Programming with Unity and C# for more than 10 years now and as a result I have plenty of experience in what works and what doesn't when it comes to learning how to code.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>My promise to You</strong></p><p>This course will be rather demanding. Programming is no easy topic but if you stick to it and do the exercises and projects yourself you will aquire an excellent understanding of the Unity Game-Engine and have the skills to implement your own 2D-Games.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is this Unity - C# Course all about?</strong></p><p>In this Course you'll not only learn the Essentials of C# and Unity but also how to code with the mindset of a professional Game-Programmer.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>This course will cover everything you need to know to start developing your own games with Unity including:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Basics of C# and Console Applications</strong></p><ul><li><p>Variables</p></li><li><p>Creating Console-Applications</p></li><li><p>If-Statements</p></li><li><p>Loops</p></li><li><p>Collections</p></li><li><p>Functions / Methods</p></li><li><p>Workflows in Visual Sudio</p></li></ul><p><strong>Unity</strong></p><ul><li><p>Unity - Editor - Basics</p></li><li><p>Setting up Unity Projects</p></li><li><p>Using Physics</p></li><li><p>Basic Scripting in Unity</p></li><li><p>Differences between classical C# development and Unity</p></li><li><p>Moving Objects</p></li><li><p>Creating/Destroying Objects</p></li><li><p>Handle Collisions</p></li><li><p>Audio</p></li><li><p>Fire Projectiles</p></li><li><p>Export Projects</p></li><li><p>Multiple Levels</p></li><li><p>Timers &amp; Cooldowns</p></li><li><p>User Interface (Text, Buttons, HP-Bars...)</p></li><li><p>Vector-Math for more complex movement</p></li><li><p>Rotating Objects</p></li><li><p>Common Pitfalls in Unity</p></li><li><p>Professional Workflows for Unity - Programming</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1!</strong></p><p>Cheers,<br>Andreas</p>",

  "description": "<p>By learning to create <strong>Compute Shaders</strong>, you will put yourself at the <strong>cutting edge of Unity development</strong>. Unlike a traditional shader, you can use a Compute Shader to handle any data manipulation problem, where having dozens (or even hundreds) of threads running simultaneously causing a bottleneck in your game to run many, <strong>many times faster</strong>. In this course you will start from <strong>small steps</strong>, learning the basics of compute shaders. First, we look at passing data from the CPU to the GPU <strong>using buffers</strong>. Then we’ll look at using these buffers in our calculations. Once you have this initial grounding, you learn how to use these techniques to <strong>create blisteringly-fast post-processing filters</strong>. You can use Compute Shaders to handle particle effects and flocking calculations. In the course, you'll <strong>create a flock of thousands of birds</strong> where each bird flaps its wings in sync with its speed through the air. Divide and conquer is the way, with Compute Shaders. By using hundreds of threads running simultaneously, we develop a <strong>GPU Physics engine</strong> that can handle thousands of tumbling chess pieces. Compute Shaders are ideal for handling the orientation of grass blades as an <strong>avatar moves through grass</strong>. The challenging subject of <strong>fluids </strong>(both 2D and 3D) are covered in the course and you'll see how much this computationally-intensive field benefits from Compute Shaders.</p><p>The resources for the course are presented as a <strong>code-along version</strong> and a <strong>complete version</strong> and include <strong>over 30 different examples</strong>. Unity Compute Shaders provides the ideal platform to learn how to <strong>handle complex problems in your games</strong>. Flocking calculations using the 3 key rules of Separation, Cohesion, and Alignment are covered in detail. The physics calculations to handle <strong>fast collision detection</strong> and the forces involved are included (both theoretically and practically). Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics is a technique for calculating <strong>fluid simulations</strong>. We'll take you through it from the foundation level. </p><p>If you're working with Unity, you need to <strong>understand how to use Compute Shaders</strong> to ensure your game has the <strong>best performance</strong>. After all, why let the GPU sit idle while the CPU&nbsp;is working overtime? You'll see <strong>massive performance improvements</strong> if you switch some tasks to the GPU&nbsp;and handle them with a Compute Shader. </p><p>This course uses <strong>Unity 2019.4</strong> and is <strong>Windows and Mac compatible</strong>. </p><p><strong>Student feedback</strong></p><p>\"<strong>This course is simply amazing</strong>. I always wanted to learn those topics and finally got some incredible resources. Thank you a lot. Btw I loved the didactic. The default scenes and challenges are really helping me to stick with the course without getting frustrated. The topics covered are very difficult but you made it in a way where we can really get step by step and at the same time seeing incredible things on screen!\"<br>\"This course is an intensive, <strong>well explained</strong>, understanding on how compute shaders work, <strong>impressive results and explanations</strong>\"<br>\"<strong>Amazing course</strong> - followed up Penny De Byls CG Shader course with this one and they dovetail excellently. Nicholas does a <strong>great job</strong> with some interesting projects and great concepts - loved the section on fluid simulation.\"<br>\"I have just started the Compute Shaders course from Holistic 3D. <strong>Loving the course</strong>, and I am finding it <strong>super easy to understand! </strong>Been looking for a decent tutorial for ages, and this is definitely the one I have been looking for!\"<br>\"<strong>Great tutorial</strong>, knowledge is <strong>condensed and easy to acquire</strong>. I always wanted to learn programming shaders and GPU computing, so this course is something that <strong>fits my needs perfectly</strong>!\"<br>\"This <strong>course excels</strong> at filling in the blanks from my self-taught knowledge and understanding of compute shaders. The explanations are concise yet full, all the while aiding the connection of the basics to form a solid foundation!\"</p><p>\"Course is <strong>super informative</strong> with great pacing (on the fast side) and plenty of challenges along the way. The challenges are why I am giving the<strong> 5-star rating</strong>. These tend to require some thought, but are solvable using what we have learned, and for my taste, just the <strong>right level of difficulty</strong>.\"</p><p>\"This course is absolutely a must for any 3D graphics developer. It is the <strong>best resource</strong> I have seen online without a doubt. Nicholas is an <strong>amazing instructor</strong> and he is able to explain really complicated concepts such as Navier-Stokes equations is very simple terms. I would <strong>give 10 stars</strong> it if was possible. Way beyond my expectations and I will watch it again several times as references. Thank you Mr. Lever for your <strong>outstanding work</strong> in teaching incredible content with very <strong>accessible language</strong>. Please more physics simulation :)\"</p><p>\"This is absolutely <strong>worth your time and money</strong> if you want to learn about compute shaders.&nbsp; Nik Lever takes the time to explain the relevant code line by line and is clearly knowledgeable about the subject. His <strong>jovial</strong> British spirit will encourage even the most jaded souls to hone their knowledge as he presents coding challenges that grow incrementally in complexity as the course progresses. Will be checking out whatever course he creates next.\"</p><p>\"I have been struggling with a bottleneck in my project and learning about compute shaders gave me a whole new perspective. The i<strong>nstructor knows what he's talking about</strong>. This is a <strong>very good course</strong> on the subject.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What others are saying about Nik's courses:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Very rich content and impressive didactics. Very good to learn from someone who has mastered the subject and knows how to teach.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Nik's style of teaching made me understand everything very intuitively and I'm so comfortable with shaders now.</em></p></li><li><p><em>I like Nik's courses, I understand in the way he explains. Great content.</em></p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Create high-quality games without a single line of code</strong></p><p>If you are looking for a fast and powerful visual scripting system that can create any game you want, Unreal Engine Blueprints is your go to programming language. Use the same tools and principles AAA studios use in their Unreal Blueprint projects to create high-quality games. Everything is free.</p><p><strong>Jump right into game creation with Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints</strong></p><p>The beauty about Blueprint visual scripting is that it allows you to jump right into game creation, and gives you a great entry to game development, but at the same time can be a standalone as the case for many professionals. Game designers and artist use Unreal Blueprints to showcase their animations, user interfaces, and audio. Programmers and game developers use Blueprints to code whole games or prototypes, but can also be used in addition to C++.</p><p><strong>By the end of this course, you will have learned the fundamentals of Unreal Engine 5 blueprints and coded a small platformer game with easy follow-along videos. You will be able to use what you have learned in character creation, movement, collision, spawn points, and level changes in your own UE5 Blueprint game project.</strong></p><p>My name is Moustafa and I am the director and developer of Farmtale on Steam done only on Blueprints. With many years of experience within game development, I will be here for you every step of the way.</p><p><strong>This course covers all you need to know about UE5 Blueprints to code your first game, including:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Variables</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Events, functions, and macros</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Arrays</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Execution flow</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Enumeration</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Blueprint actors, classes, and communication</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>Learn the best coding practice from a published Unreal Blueprint game developer</strong></p><p>All code is not equal. There are many ways to develop games, some better for performance than others. Some code might even break. I will show you how to use different optimization tools to achieve game-ready performance.</p><p><strong>Join our supportive and sharing community on Discord.</strong></p><p><strong>See you in lesson 1!</strong></p><p>I wish you the best,</p><p>Moustafa Nafei</p>",

  "description": "<p>With <strong>Socket IO</strong> it is very easy to create a game where multiple remote players can share data. In this course we start by installing <strong>NODE.js</strong>, a prerequisite of Socket IO.&nbsp; NODE.js is an <strong>open source server environment</strong>. We make sure NODE.js is working correctly and that you understand how to run it by running through a few very <strong>simple examples</strong>. </p><p>In section 3 we move on to building a <strong>simple chat app</strong> using Socket IO and I show you how to use the <strong>rooms capability</strong> of Socket IO to limit inter-Socket communication to groups of sockets that share a room. </p><p>Section 4 introduces the <strong>WebGL library, THREE.js</strong>, and shows how to display assets using this library.</p><p>.Section 5 looks at accessing online 3D resources both models and animations and shows how you can use Blender to edit these assets.</p><p>Section 6 covers in more detail using THREE.js for games.</p><p>Section 7 brings 3D and Socket IO together to create a framework for a game where we see <strong>remote players moving.</strong></p><p>Section 8 shows how we can chat to remote players by sending a private chat message, socket to socket.</p><p>Section 9 shows how to take your game to a live server. </p><p>The final section gives some important tips when using NODE.js and Socket IO with the THREE.js library in an online game. </p><p><strong>Having completed the course you will have all the skills necessary to create 3D multi-player games of your own. With the 30 day money back guarantee you can start the course today with complete confidence.</strong></p><p>Here is are some reviews of the course:</p><p>”Nik's tutorials are brilliant”</p><p>”The instructor really explained the whole concept of the process of setting up a complete 3D multi-user chat app using the latest and hottest technologies in a nutshell; I'd like to say he demystified it.”</p><p>\"This course helped me a lot to finish my running project. I loved this course very much. It is probably the only course which shows the use of THREE.js to create a 3d game. It's socket io implementation is amazing. I would surely recommend to enroll in this course.\"</p><p>... and what students on my <strong>other THREE.js courses</strong> have to say:</p><p>”Easy to Understand and detailed”</p><p>”This course is really awesome! I enjoyed every second of this learning experience.”</p><p>\"Really good course, highly recommend. ... The last time I tried to learn the source code was 20,000 lines of C#. Without the helper classes, this author achieves an awesome 3D Car game in less than 400 lines. In the past I have had a lot of issues with getting FBX from Blender into a THREE.js scene but here it is easily explained and worked effortlessly. Huge thanks to Nik for this fantastic course.\"</p>",

  "description": "<p>Back in 1995, we had the Internet revolution connecting people around the World using 2D websites. Now, the same is happening but in 3D. Instead of 2D pages, we already have 3D experiences via VR headsets. And all these will eventually get us to the Metaverse which is the successor to the internet where we will be all connected in a Virtual Space with our own Avatars, virtual homes, and economy.&nbsp; To become a part of building the Metaverse, we must definitely know at least one Game Engine to create immersive virtual worlds. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Unreal Engine from Epic Games will be one of the few tools empowering the Metaverse! </strong>So, that's why it is the best time to learn Unreal Engine VR Development. And we created this course just for that. In this course, you will quickly get started with your Unreal Engine career. We spent tons of time creating the tutorials so that you can save time and learn this complex topic in a very short time. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>By enrolling in this course, you will learn the VR Development Fundamental topics such as: </strong></p><ul><li><p>Setting up and Configuring Unreal Engine for VR Development</p></li><li><p>Blueprints Visual Scripting System Basics</p></li><li><p>Gameplay Framework in Unreal Engine</p></li><li><p>Blueprint Actors</p></li><li><p>Creating VR Pawn</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Also, you will build the basic VR Interactions from scratch such as:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Grabbing</p></li><li><p>Adding and animating VR Hands</p></li><li><p>Moving with Thumbstick input</p></li><li><p>Teleportation</p></li><li><p>Snap Turning </p></li><li><p>UI Interactions</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p>At the end of this course, you will have built your own VR Template project that you can use on your projects. Also, you will have built a simple game, Escape From Train from the Blueprints section. Overall, you will have a solid understanding and starting project (you built!) for VR Development in Unreal Engine 4. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enroll now and let's build the Metaverse together!</strong></p><p><strong>-Tevfik</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>***Updated for Vuforia 8 and Unity 2020.1 ***</strong></p><p><strong>The Fastest Way to Learn Vuforia 8 and Develop 16 Augmented Reality Apps using Unity SDK in under 5 hours!</strong></p><p><strong>Why should I take this course?</strong></p><p>There are plenty of courses on Augmented Reality, with courses that run over 10 hours. When I got started in AR, I wanted to learn the Vuforia as quick as possible, because for obvious reasons, time is money. The company I was working for at the time, didn't have the luxury of time to spend on long training courses. So we had to learn learn Vuforia in our own time outside work hours, can you believe it!</p><p>After watching&nbsp; tons of courses and reading through Vuforia documentation, I realized that this SDK is really quite simple and the key concepts to started with developing apps can really be learnt in just a few hours.</p><p>That is why I developed this course, to teach you all the&nbsp; fundamentals of the Augmented Reality&nbsp;in the shortest time;&nbsp; so that you can get started developing your own Augmented Reality Apps and decrease your time to market. Being compact does not mean that we compromise on content, we cover the exact same content as courses that run over 10 hours. </p><p><strong>Who is my lecturer? And what makes you qualified to teach me?</strong></p><p>My Name is Ritesh Kanjee and I host the popular <strong>YouTube Channel</strong> called Augmented Startups with over <strong>62 000 subscribers</strong>. I am an AR/AI Developer with a <em>Masters Degree</em> in Electronic Engineering, teaching over <strong>46 000&nbsp;students</strong> on Udemy. With over 7 years of AR&nbsp;and Unity experience, you can trust that you are in the right hands.</p><p><strong>Okay so your qualified! What will I learn in this course?</strong></p><p>This course is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of Augmented Reality using the Vuforia SDK in Unity&nbsp;through practical and easy to understand labs.&nbsp;</p><p>This class covers these capabilities, including getting started, simple and multiple target detection, smart terrain as well as leap motion integration. You will learn all the fundamentals through practice as you follow along with the training. </p><p>Together we will build a strong foundation in AR in Unity&nbsp;SDK&nbsp;with this training for beginners. This course will enable you to:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Get started</strong> in Unity and how to download the Vuforia SDK</p></li><li><p>Create a simple AR&nbsp;app with a floating cube</p></li><li><p>Once you have mastered the basics we go ahead and create multiple targets in Augmented Reality</p></li><li><p>Create <strong>virtual buttons</strong> to add interactivity to your AR apps.</p></li><li><p>Display Video on a physical wall.</p></li><li><p>Leverage the<strong> Leap Motion</strong> Controller to create a pinch drawing app in AR. (Really Cool!)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Implement Vuforia's&nbsp;<strong>smart terrain</strong> algorithm to detection objects in Real Time!</p></li><li><p>Detect Cylindrical Target Objects and animate markers</p></li><li><p>Vuforia 7 and Unity 2017.3</p></li><li><p>[NEW] Vuforia 7 <strong>Ground Plane (Similar to Googles&nbsp;ARCore)</strong></p><p><br></p></li><li><p>[NEW] Vuforia 8 and Unity 2020.1</p></li><li><p>[NEW] Vuforia 8 Video Playback</p></li><li><p>[NEW] Vuforia 8 VI-SLAM Fundamentals</p></li><li><p>[BONUS] Vuforia 8 Export to Android Device</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>[HUGE&nbsp;BONUS] Build your own <strong>AI&nbsp;Smart Glasses Project E.D.I.T.H.</strong> (Spiderman Far From Home)</p></li></ul><p><strong>What if I'm not happy with this course?</strong></p><p>We also offer a full Udemy 30 Day Money Back Guarantee if you are not happy with this course, so you can learn with no risk to you.</p><p><strong>Personal help within the course?</strong></p><p>I want you to succeed.

  "description": "<p>Learning to code can be both fun and rewarding . Java is a useful ,robust and popular programming language to embark on that journey.<br>This course is a practical Hands-on course from the first to the last section. The best way to learn is by doing so you will be doing a lot of coding.<br> Java  is  a  case-sensitive, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.  One of the reasons Java is so popular is that it is platform independent . You only need to write java code once and then run it on any platform  be it mac, windows or Linux.</p>\n\n<p> In this course we will create 17 practical and useful projects step by step. The projects include:<br>Calculator<br>Digital Clock<br>Weight Converter<br>Temperature Converter<br>Height Converter<br>Random Number Generator<br>BMI Calculator Tool<br>Percentage Calculator<br>Word Count Tool<br>Add number  program<br>Program to determine Even numbers<br>Program to determine Leap Year<br>Program to calculate area  and perimeter of a circle<br>Program to find highest number<br>Program to find Prime Numbers<br>Program to create a triangle <br>Program to determine largest numbers</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br> This course  will  guide you through java basics, its core syntax, and the fundamentals of writing strong java code.  I will  show you how to install Java JDK and NetBeans IDE. Netbeans is a  great IDE for developing in java, and then dive into the language itself. Along the way, we will cover topics such as:<br>Declaring and initializing variables with a variety of data types<br>Exploring  Basic Arithmetic operators<br>Troubleshoot Compile errors<br>Controlling flow with conditional code<br>Creating Method<br>Creating Event Handler methods<br>Using Component controls and changing their properties</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If java is your first step into programming or adding it your existing skillset, these training videos will help you understand the language and use it to build your own great software.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Hi everyone, I'm Big Cat.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>About the Content</strong></p><p>This course is a complete set of tutorials for the Battle Royale type of game. The features are so huge that they were not shown in the promo video to show all the features. For example, the bullets fired all have a downward effect and reduce the flight speed based on the distance.

Because every function in a blueprint can be found in C++, learning blueprints can still help you with your C++ development.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Write at the end</strong></p><p>I did all the work on this course by myself, including blueprint development, lecture writing, video recording, audio recording, captioning, video editing, and even the Green-Screen technology at the beginning of the promo. Every detail was tweaked over and over again to give you as perfect an experience as possible. It's tough to produce a go-to course. I know there are still many things I didn't get right, like my English accent, and I hope you can understand more.

  "description": "<p><strong>\"This course is a great way to get introduced to coding and bringing the game together from a full SLDC stance. The instructors are responsive, and the Q&amp;A sections are extremely helpful. 100% worth the time invested to learn through this course.\" -Derek H.</strong></p><p>\"I learned so much from taking this course about Blender and Unity and making games in general. Thanks for such an awesome course!\" - Joseph D.</p><p><strong>\"Before this course I only knew basic coding. During this course, mostly due to the great explanations, I learned so much about coding. Looking forward to taking more courses of Mammoth after I make this game shine for my 2 daughters who loved to play every bit of the game during the course.\" ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐</strong></p><p>\"Very comprehensive tutorial for fans of Zelda and Metroidvania games. Goes straight into basic coding with C#, very brief and more of a refresher than a course on C#, then goes straight into coding the game with <strong>movement controls, camera controls, AI, ability acquisition, dungeon completion, and designing</strong> with Blender. Lessons are straight to the point, easy to follow, and perfect for people who are learning the more intermediate to advanced coding techniques required for these games. Extremely impressed; would learn again!\"</p><p>\"I really like the way the instructor explains the syntax of the code. He is thorough and explains how the syntax works as he shows you how to write it and what it does and how it functions. <strong>Need more instructors like him</strong>...\"</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong>In this course, you learn how to build a 3D game with Unity® and Blender. This course is unique because we make both the code and the art for the game from scratch. </strong></p><ul><li><p>Learn the fundamentals of designing, coding, and modeling a 3D game.</p></li><li><p>Design the game \"The Legend of Zenda\" and its functionality in Unity®. </p></li><li><p>Learn how to code in C# and build video game levels. </p></li></ul><p><strong>Why Unity®?</strong></p><p>Unity® is one of the most popular platforms in game development. You can use Unity® to build 2D and 3D games. Unity® is cross-platform, which means it is easy to use with other platforms.</p><p>Then you create the 3D models for the game in Blender. You build all the art assets for the game, including the characters, weapons, cannon, dungeon, and temple. You learn how to integrate your art from Blender into Unity®.</p><p>\"At the first glance, I was not very amazed, but when I saw the curriculum and methods used in the classes, I am certain that one can take as much as possible out of this course into a real world example. The course teaches you: Unity from ground up C# Programming in general Blender modeling So you don't have to understand Unity nor programming nor Blender. The pace is more on the slow side, but it is very easy to grasp and pick up. <strong>It is a great tutorial package with A HUGE library of steps</strong>. Highly recommended!\"</p><p>\"The programming portion is very well explained. The instructor provides very good examples on how C# programming is performed on objects. I'm enjoying the Blender portion of the course. The development of a character in Blender is explained very well and I've learned many new techniques for UV Mapping the character.\"</p><p><strong>Why Blender?</strong></p><p>Blender, like Unity®, is a popular production suite that is free to download. Blender is a revolutionary tool for making 3D art digitally. With Blender, you can make art assets for games, like we do in this course. </p><ul><li><p>The pace is more on the slow side, but this course is very easy to grasp and pick up. It is a great tutorial package with A HUGE library of steps.</p></li></ul><p>Even if you're not an artist, you can make basic art models. You may have heard of Axiom Verge and Stardew Valley. These games are million-dollar successes. But did you know that only one person made each? </p><p>Usually it takes a whole team of people to build a game. But creators Thomas Happ and Eric Barone developed and designed their games by themselves. Now they're millionaires. You can do it, too.</p><p><strong>Let's get started!</strong><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Any self-respecting game developer knows that getting their third-person player character right is one of the fundamental keys to a great gaming experience. Not only this but the controller, once developed, can be transferred from one game to another, making the code reusable and scalable. In this course, you will learn how to put together your own third-person character from scratch using freely available 3D models and animations, which you will learn how to control with C# in Unity.&nbsp; The idea behind this course is to take students through a series of workshops with the necessary tools to help them make a character, animate a character and program a character without the need of being able to model or animate and gain an understanding of the third-person character controller pipeline.</p><p>This course uses <strong>Unity 2020.1 or 2020.2, Input System 1.0, and Cinemachine 2.6.3</strong></p><p><strong>Learn how to program and work with:</strong></p><ul><li><p>3D Characters and Rigs</p></li><li><p>Humanoid Avatars</p></li><li><p>The Mecanim System</p></li><li><p>Avatar Masks</p></li><li><p>Animation Blend Trees</p></li><li><p>Unity's new Input System Package</p></li><li><p>Unity's Cinemachine Package for 'Character Following' Cameras</p></li><li><p>Adobe's Mixamo Service for Rigging and Animating 3D Characters</p></li><li><p>Third-Person Character Controllers</p></li><li><p>Mixing Root Motion with Physics Controls</p></li></ul><p>What people are saying about Penny's courses:</p><ul><li><p><em>Dr. Penny is a wonderful person and a true expert. All of her courses I've taken have been top notch and in my opinion there is no better teacher out there.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Allow me to say how hugely important this is for a person who is interested in certain types of game design. Creating games where you can create AI behaviors that support emergent situations.</em></p></li><li><p><em> I honestly love Holistic's teaching approach and I've never learned so much within a few hours about coding effectively with such detailed explanations!</em></p></li></ul><p>This course focuses on the building of typical third-person character functionality including jumping, falling, weapon handling, shooting, and taking damage. By the end of this course, you will have a great third-person character controller that you can use in your own games or adapt for customized situations.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Who doesn’t love a good endless runner? Did you know it’s the genre that reigns from the early platform games of Donkey Kong and Mario Brothers? From Canabalt to Temple Run to Subway Surfer, this casual game has been the pastime of many a gamer with a mobile device and a few moments to while away. But did you know there’s quite a bit of work that goes into such a game? Of course the scenery is repetitive, but did you know that it has to be constructed with pieces of the environment that can always fit together and be procedurally placed?</p><p>In this course, Penny will take you through all the stages of game development with C# and the Unity Game Engine using her internationally acclaimed Holistic teaching style and expertise from over 25 years teaching, researching and writing about games. Throughout the course you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to teach you these core programming concepts that will take your games to the next level.&nbsp; All assets including models, animations, textures and sounds are supplied.</p><p>The objective of this course is to teach you all you need to know to make your own game!</p><p><strong>Learn how to program and work with:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Character and World Models</p></li><li><p>Character Animations</p></li><li><p>Procedural Infinite World Generation</p></li><li><p>Graphical User Interfaces</p></li><li><p>Pick-ups</p></li><li><p>Particle Systems</p></li><li><p>Background Music</p></li><li><p>Sound Effects</p></li></ul><p><strong>Content and Overview</strong></p><p>The course begins with setting up the character and applying animations in the Unity mecanim system, before writing code to control them.&nbsp; It continues step-by-step, going through the development of an infinite scrolling 3D world, including the use of the pooling and singleton design patterns. In these sections, obstacles such as fire and walls are added which the character is programmed to jump over and destroy. Thereafter, a graphical user interface (GUI) is put together in Unity's canvas system, where you will learn about alignment, fonts and screen resolutions as well as how to program button presses, sliders and create pop-up windows.&nbsp; Next, particle systems are investigated as a means of providing some special effects and several are constructed from scratch for magical spells and explosions.&nbsp; Finally, background music and sound effects are covered, as is controlling the sound of each from the GUI.</p><p><strong>What students are saying about Penny's courses:</strong></p><ul><li><p>She is the best teacher ever in this platform.</p></li><li><p>Most instructors are very smart people. Some are good at teaching and some are not. Penny is great at describing complex concepts without going down a dark cerebral rabbit hole that so many instructors feel obligated to do. It's like they need to demonstrate their knowledge by explaining every tiny aspect. Penny does not go there. She explains things clearly but does not overwhelm the student with more than they need to know. There is only so much most people can absorb in one sitting. You need to study, then you need to practice and then more study. I have taken most of her classes and I recommend them all.</p></li></ul>",

Also I am a firm believer, that you can only learn the high craft (some might even say art) of programming, if you practice it. Which is why I put much effort into making the advantages of these designpatterns clear by giving you small practical assignments where you are challenged to improve an existing game's code with these designpatterns.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Become a better Programmer, now!

  "description": "<p>Ready to <strong>create games</strong> in Unreal Engine 5? </p><p><br></p><p><strong>No Programming Experience Required!</strong></p><p>Learn game development with Unreal Engine 5, the world's leading free game engine. This is the engine that brought us AAA titles such as Fortnite, the Batman Arkham series, Bioshock, and hundreds more. Opening this engine may seem intimidating at a glance, but this course is here to teach you how to become comfortable with the layout and game making process by creating an <strong>Endless Runner</strong> game. We will go step by step through the <strong>game-making process </strong>to show how we can set up a character with fluid and responsive movement, well-designed gameplay, and a lot more- without even writing a single line of code!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Unreal Engine Blueprints</strong></p><p>We will be using UE5's built-in visual scripting system, blueprints, to create all the logic for our game. Blueprints are a visual form of C++ and are changing the way creating video games are approached across the world. It may seem like a lot at first, but with the gentle guiding of this course you will quickly understand the efficiency and power of this simple-to-understand system.</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, you will:</p><ul><li><p>Make a <strong>complete </strong>game</p></li><li><p>Become <strong>comfortable </strong>coding with blueprints</p></li><li><p>Learn the engine's interface and terminology</p></li><li><p>Understand <strong>actor types</strong></p></li><li><p>Experiment with different types of collisions</p></li><li><p><strong>Characters </strong>and character movement</p></li><li><p>Blueprint logic</p></li><li><p>Music and audio</p></li><li><p>Gain the confidence to turn UE5 into a <strong>profitable </strong>future</p></li><li><p>Become an <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong> hero!</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Take This Course?</strong></p><p>Even if an endless runner game isn't your interest, this course provides the steps necessary to create a video game from start to finish. You will learn many fundamental things about the game-making process and will be able to <strong>utilize that knowledge</strong> in the projects you work on from here on out. I'm excited to see what you can create because Unreal Engine 5 is the tool you need to grasp that opportunity. So are you ready?</p><p><br></p><p><em>Let's start making a video game!</em></p>",

How do games allow you to sign up for a new user account, receiving a 6 digit verification code in their email, allowing them verify their account for your game?</p><p>Have you ever wondered how to save player data in databases, so they can see their achievements in the game, showing their progress, skill level, items, or stats from previous matches? Or how leaderboards are made, showing the top scoring players who play the game across the planet?</p><p>How can you run dedicated servers that players can connect to? How can you set up servers in different regions around the globe, providing access to your game to players in different countries, allowing them to enjoy gameplay with the lowest possible ping times? And how to make competitive multiplayer games fair to all players, with an authoritative server optimized to manage server operations, reduce lag and provide a consistent and performant experience for everyone?</p><p>This course is a masterclass for dedicated servers and cloud backend for unreal engine games.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p><ul><li><p>Compile Unreal Engine from source, create client and server build targets, and package dedicated server and client builds of your game</p></li><li><p>Integrate the GameLift Server SDK into your game to connect with GameLift</p></li><li><p>Learn how to make API calls with the AWS (command-line interface)</p></li><li><p>Host dedicated servers, both <strong>on your own machine</strong> and on cloud-hosted <strong>virtual machines</strong> (and you’ll know what those are)</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create serverless functions (in AWS Lambda) to access cloud resources and use AWS SDKs</p></li><li><p>Create secure user pools, where your game's players can create their own login/password, with email verification with Amazon Cognito</p></li><li><p>Implement security, requiring temporary access tokens granted via user pool login in order to perform game actions</p></li><li><p>Create your own REST API with endpoints that can be accessed via HTTP request, and secure them to require authentication tokens using Amazon API Gateway</p></li><li><p>Learn about HTTP requests and how to send them from Unreal Engine C++ code, triggering serverless functions and accessing cloud resources</p></li><li><p>Learn about formatting JSON data for HTTP requests, and Unreal's JSON utilities for conversion from JSON to USTRUCTs for ease of use of data retrieved from the cloud</p></li><li><p>Create NoSQL databases, storing persistent game data for players, including game stats, career, and leaderboard info using the DynamoDB, a <strong>high-speed</strong>, <strong>highly optimized</strong> system for <strong>storing data to databases</strong></p></li><li><p>Implement <strong>game lobbies</strong>, managed by dedicated servers, displaying player names and efficiently replicating lobby data with <strong>Fast Array Serializers</strong></p></li><li><p>Create a <strong>sign up/login menu</strong> with <strong>email verification </strong>for new users, and a game <strong>Access Portal </strong>where we can view <strong>Career</strong> and <strong>Leaderboard </strong>data, as well as launch the game lobby</p></li><li><p>Learn <strong>AWS best practices</strong> when it comes to <strong>security</strong>,<strong> Identity and Access Management</strong>, <strong>Identity Center</strong>, <strong>Roles</strong>, <strong>Policies</strong>, and <strong>Permissions</strong></p></li><li><p>Learn how to access the AWS documentation for all AWS APIs and how to easily use them to create code to create, access, and manipulate data on the cloud</p></li><li><p>Create and manage <strong>Game Sessions</strong> and <strong>Player Sessions</strong> in <strong>Amazon GameLift</strong></p></li><li><p>Create Server and Client packaged builds of your game, and connect to the server from client builds without any external tools (<strong>just launch the game, sign-in in the game, connect in the game</strong>)</p></li><li><p>Connect to cloud services <strong>without even being connected to a game server</strong> (<strong>single-player games</strong>)</p></li><li><p>Closely monitor your aws billing and management console and setup billing alarms</p></li></ul><p>And so much more!</p><p>You’ll be creating an AWS account and learning how to manage it using recommended best practices for the cloud. All of the core features of this course use the free tier, aside from two optional lectures using advanced security features in AWS for custom access token scopes – which cost me less than .69 cents to implement for this course. But you can skip those two lectures if you wish to stay in the free tier.</p><p>I’ve created and provided you with an FPS template project as a starting point, with shooter mechanics so we can have some stats to save to the cloud, but it’s not required – you can use your own game project, or a completely empty game project if you want! This course is about creating and hosting servers and setting up the cloud backend for your games.</p><p>We’ll be downloading and compiling Unreal Engine from source – which means you will need at least 230 GB of storage for this course. You must know the basics of Unreal Engine C++. You must use an Unreal source build of at least UE5.4 or above. (You can use the latest version of the engine, everything works).</p><p><strong>You do NOT need any experience or knowledge of cloud architecture.</strong></p><p>It’s time to take your games to the next level, and learn how shipped games manage their users, data, and their game servers.</p><p>Are you ready to upgrade your game development skills? I’ll see you in the course!</p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course I am going to be showing you how to create your own fighting game inside of the Unity game engine.</p><ul><li><p>We're going to be bringing in a series of free characters as well as a wide range of free animations so that each character can have their own unique style.</p></li><li><p>We're going to create a character select screen and we're also going to setup AI characters, these are computer controlled characters that will fight against you and it will seem as though the AI character is just as effective and just as realistic as a real player. The characters you choose will dynamically load into the level you choose and there are a wide variety of levels to choose from.</p></li><li><p>We will also be setting up a 2 player mode and mapping the controls for 2 game pad controllers so you can have two people playing at the same time. You can control characters either by game pad or by keyboard.</p></li><li><p>We will setup options so that you can set a difficulty level for the AI characters. You will also be able to adjust the volume for music and sound effects independently.</p></li><li><p>We're going to be setting up animator controllers for each character and controlling the animations through various parameters that will be called in C# scripts. We're going to create a wide range of C# scripts using easy to understand and easy to implement code.</p></li></ul><p>So by the end of this course you will have a fully completed fighting game which will look great in your portfolios. You can also include your completed game for free on websites or sell it commercially online through Steam or other such websites. You will also have gained the experience and knowledge of how to make this type of game inside of the Unity game engine.</p><p>Why not enroll today and I look forward to seeing you in my course.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to your <strong>ultimate solution</strong> for <strong>Unreal Engine 5's Dynamic Sky and Weather System</strong>. In this course, you'll embark on a journey to create <strong>a robust sky system</strong> featuring <strong>a dynamic day-night cycle</strong>, mesmerizing <strong>volumetric clouds</strong>, immersive <strong>snowy weather</strong> complete with <strong>footprints</strong> and intricate <strong>snow particles</strong>, and even <strong>rainy weather</strong> with lifelike <strong>raindrops</strong>, <strong>puddles</strong>, and captivating <strong>lightning effects</strong>. Best of all, <strong>we'll be starting from the ground up</strong>.</p><p>In the first section, we'll delve into creating the fundamental day-night cycle. We'll bring stars, the moon, and detailed variables into play, enabling us to fine-tune the appearance of our sky system. Our journey begins with crafting a Blueprint Dynamic Sky Actor, offering a streamlined lighting solution. From there, we'll employ the construction script to lay the foundations of a basic time-of-day system using Blueprint macros. As we progress, we'll explore the concept of a sky sphere and a sky material, introducing our own customizable stars and moon through blueprint variables.</p><p>Moving on to the second section, we'll introduce 2D clouds and volumetric clouds to our dynamic sky system. This adventure starts with creating a Blueprint enum to define distinct cloud modes. We'll then enhance our sky material, built in the previous section, to incorporate 2D clouds seamlessly. Additionally, we'll delve into planar projection, uncovering its role in projecting volumetric clouds onto the sky. We'll explore volume texture and volumetric advanced output for heightened realism and harness normalized altitude masks and macro variations for intricate detail and captivating shapes. After breathing life into our clouds with animations, we'll expose more properties to our blueprint, offering greater control over the final appearance.</p><p>In the third section, we'll construct a basic landscape complemented by an automatic landscape material, enabling texture bombing, tri-planar projection, and slope blending. We'll initiate the process by sculpting a rudimentary landscape using the noise texture at our disposal. Subsequently, we'll delve into the concepts of texture bombing and tri-planar projection, revolutionizing our landscape's tiling capabilities.</p><p>In the next section, we'll introduce snowy weather into our system, complete with footprints, snow particles, snow blending for landscapes and objects, and dynamic snow blending. Our journey commences with an exploration of snowy weather lighting within a testing environment. We'll introduce the notion of data assets, blueprint structs, and how they serve as repositories for various lighting properties and weather switching mechanisms. The creation of a snow blend mask for both landscapes and objects will be followed by insights into using material parameter collections for global weather FX control. We'll also explore anim notifies, blueprint macro libraries, decal materials, and Niagara systems to selectively spawn footprints during snowy conditions. Additionally, we'll develop a custom Niagara module for efficient particle generation, using it as a template to produce our snow particles. Lastly, we'll implement dynamic snow blending, employing a timeline within our blueprint.</p><p>In the final section, we'll tackle rainy weather, complete with raindrops, puddles, interactive splashes, lightning, and post-process raindrop FX. The journey begins with the creation of a new data asset for rainy weather. We'll delve into the intricacies of generating procedural puddles and employing flip book animations within our materials to create ripples. A custom material function for wave generation, as well as the blending of puddles with our landscape, will be covered. We'll then master the art of crafting performant rain FX by establishing a master liquid material and a rain Niagara system. Our exploration extends to custom Niagara input scripting and dot product utilization to scale raindrop brightness based on both distance and viewing angle. Generating splashes through collision events and user parameters for rain FX will be seamlessly integrated. We'll also explore the concept of physical materials and how they define surface types, allowing us to spawn splashes when characters tread on puddles. Lastly, we'll create a material for lightning and initiate work on the accompanying Niagara system. Finally, we'll transform surface raindrops into a post-process material for our system.</p><p>This course is the most comprehensive guide you'll find online for creating a sky and weather system. Throughout the course, applied tasks and section challenges will ensure your comprehension and ability to replicate each step. </p>",

  "description": "<p>This is the most comprehensive online course that will take you from a complete beginner to creating your own games in Unity game engine.</p><p>And not only that, but this course will teach you the complete process of creating a game step by step from an empty project to a playable game.</p><p>To achieve this, the course is completely project based, and not just simple hello world or move the cube projects, but I am actually taking all the knowledge that I&nbsp;have learned about game development and creating my own games that I've published on the app store, and I&nbsp;am teaching you the exact steps I&nbsp;use to create fun to play games.</p><p>We will start with very simple things like downloading Unity, creating a sample project, and going through Unity's interface. After that, we will take a look at some basic code examples so that you can see that coding is not scary like everyone thinks. And then we will jump into C# and learn all the basic things we need to get started with game development.</p><p>As we progress through the course and create game projects, I will revise all the C# concepts that we learned up to that point and explain them with real world examples and give you tips and tricks on how you can use certain techniques in your own projects.</p><p>And not only that, but I&nbsp;will explain to you how to optimize your games from the very start so that you avoid the most common optimization heavy mistakes that not only beginners make when they create their games.</p><p>Every section in this course will gradually increase in size and depth so that you don't get overwhelmed from the very start but instead you digest every concept we learn step by step.</p><p>During the lectures, I&nbsp;will give you assignments to challenge your knowledge and to challenge your ability to think like a programmer. Because in game development, the best way to learn is by doing. Of course, I&nbsp;will provide a solution for every assignment that I&nbsp;give you, but I will expect that you try to finish it on your own because it will give you experience, and the feel of how to solve programming problems on your own. </p><p><strong>You will also benefit from my super fast response if you have any issue that you are stuck with, and oh and all the students taking the course will also be there to help you!</strong></p><p>Some of the things that you will learn in this course:</p><ul><li><p>Unity's interface</p></li><li><p>Importing Assets</p></li><li><p>Organizing The Project</p></li><li><p>Basic, Intermediate, And Advanced C# Programming</p></li><li><p>Basic AI(Artificial Intelligence)</p></li><li><p>Advanced AI(Artificial Intelligence)</p></li><li><p>Basic And Advanced Character Animations</p></li><li><p>Sound FX And Music</p></li><li><p>Basic, Intermediate And Advanced Particle FX</p></li><li><p>Learn How To Use Unity's UI System</p></li><li><p>Create And Animate Menus</p></li><li><p>Saving And Loading Game Data</p></li><li><p>Basic And Advanced Animations</p></li><li><p>Creating Reusable Code</p></li><li><p>Writing Optimized Code</p></li></ul><p><strong>That And Much More Is Awaiting You In This Course</strong></p><p>If You ever had an idea for an awesome game, then enroll in this course and learn the tools that you need to develop Your next hit game!!!</p><p><strong>What Is Your Risk By Taking This Course?</strong></p><p><strong>Nothing!!

  "description": "<p>The <strong>JavaScript</strong> programming language is probably the <strong>most popular programming language in the world</strong>. Companies all around the global require developers who are proficient with this language. In this course I teach you about the language then apply your new skills to create three games. </p><p>Before you write your first game you'll use your new JavaScript skills and the popular Open Source library, <strong>Three.JS</strong> to create several simple online 3D apps. Once you know enough about the ThreeJS library it's time to <strong>create your first game</strong>. The first game is a simple game. Here you'll learn about <strong>loading assets, moving assets, user input and collision testing.</strong> </p><p>The course <strong>builds on the skills you learn</strong>. The next game is a <strong>shooter</strong> and you learn how to animate a player avatar, how to control NPC characters so they patrol on a random path using <strong>navigation meshes and path-finding</strong>. You'll learn how to control the avatar with a <strong>keyboard or gamepad</strong> and on a mobile using an <strong>on-screen controller</strong>. You'll learn how to fire bullets at the enemy and add <strong>AI to the NPCs</strong> so they fire back. All the key ingredients of a shooter game. </p><p>The last game uses the <strong>physics engine CannonJS</strong> to control the motion of balls in an Eight-ball Pool game. </p><p>Along the way you'll learn to use the <strong>3D application program Blender</strong> to prepare your 3D assets for the games you develop. </p><p>Once you've completed the course you'll be <strong>super ready</strong> for any challenges an employer throws your way when writing JavaScript code. But the main thing is <strong>you'll have developed your much in-demand skills while having fun making games</strong>. </p><p><br></p><p>What students say about the course.</p><p>\"<strong>Best web gaming course for ThreeJS!</strong>\"</p><p>\"... a go-to for 3D graphic designers, web designers ...\"</p><p>\"<strong>Great course for beginners </strong>or JavaScript developers looking to make games!\"</p><p>\"<strong>Best course from best instructor in web development</strong>, especially in 3D web development. I recommend you check his other courses.\"</p><p>\"The course is <strong>well-structured</strong> and covers a lot of material in a concise and <strong>accessible way</strong>. I'm making good progress and <strong>really enjoy the teaching style</strong>.\"</p><p>\"Totally <strong>no fluff </strong>and <strong>eloquently wrapped together </strong>with knowledge and understanding in a comfortable flow. Very absorbable and <strong>entertaining </strong>which helps a lot when needing to review for good measure.\"</p>",

  "description": "<p><em>Behaviour Trees (BTs) </em>are an A.I. architecture that provide game characters with the ability to select behaviours and carry them out, through a tree-like architecture that defines simple but powerful logic operations.&nbsp; It can be used across a wide range of game genres from first-person shooters to real-time strategies and developing intelligent characters capable of making smart decisions.&nbsp; &nbsp;The codebase is deceptively simple and yet logical, reusable and extremely powerful.&nbsp; The library is written in <strong>C# </strong>and implemented in <strong>Unity 2020</strong>,<strong> </strong>however will easily port to other applications.</p><p>The project has been tested in <strong>Unity 6</strong>!</p><p>In this course, Penny demystifies the advanced A.I. technique of BTs used for creating believable and intelligent game characters in games,&nbsp;using her internationally acclaimed teaching style and&nbsp;knowledge from almost 30 years working with games,&nbsp;graphics, and having written two award-winning books on games AI.&nbsp;Throughout, you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to take you through every step of putting together your own BT API.&nbsp; You will build the entire BT library from the ground up, while building an <em>art gallery simulation scenario</em> in parallel, to test the API as you go.</p><p><strong>Learn how to program and work with:</strong></p><ul><li><p>A Behaviour Tree Library and API that's reusable across a wide range of game projects.</p></li><li><p>Tree architectures, nodes, leaves, sequences, and selectors that define the behaviour of individual non-player characters (NPCs). </p></li><li><p>Navigation Meshes and Agents that provide advanced path planning and navigation capabilities for characters.</p></li><li><p>A Blackboard System that acts as a global inventory for world states and allows characters to communicate with each other.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Contents and Overview</strong></p><p>Throughout the course, you will follow along while a BT library and API are constructed from the ground up, to allow you intimate knowledge of the codebase.&nbsp; Alongside this, a simple art gallery simulation will be constructed to test out the functionality of the library as it is put together.&nbsp; The simulation will also rely on Unity's NavMesh System for navigation and path planning.</p><p>The course begins with an overview of Behaviour Trees and covers all the fundamental elements (including trees, nodes, leaves, sequences, selectors, and other logical constructs). Code will be developed to navigate the Behaviour Tree and used to drive non-player characters in the art gallery including a robber, cop, visitors and workers. Throughout this, students will gain a solid knowledge of how Behaviour Trees are constructed and can be traversed, to apply actions to game characters.</p><p>At the completion of this course, students will have a fully-fledged BT library and API that they can reuse in their own game projects, to provide game characters with complex intelligent behaviours.</p><p><strong>What students are saying about Penny's courses:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Turns out, the hardest part of this course for me is finding the words to describe how glad I am to have enrolled in it.</em></p></li><li><p><em>I honestly love Hollistic's teaching approach and I've never learned so much within a few hours about coding effectively with such detailed explanations!</em></p></li><li><p><em>Penny is an excellent instructor and she does a great job of breaking down complex concepts into smaller, easy-to-understand topics.</em></p></li></ul>",

I will provide you with all the character models, animations, environment, VFX, and Post-Process settings (sound &amp; music not included so far) to make you feel like you are building a professional game from the beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>I will try to focus on every detail, but at the same time, it's better that you have some basic experience in Unity &amp; C#, such as how to navigate the scene, move and rotate GameObjects, and understand how variables and functions work.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of this course, you will be able to create game elements such as:</p><ul><li><p>Install, and setup Unity &amp; Visual Studio Code</p></li><li><p>Code basic character movement, attack, shoot and dodge abilities</p></li><li><p>Create a simple combo system</p></li><li><p>Control animations with animator controller, override animator controller, and animation event</p></li><li><p>Control VFX via script</p></li><li><p>Create AI with NavMesh system to control enemy behaviors</p></li><li><p>Use a basic state pattern to control the character's status</p></li><li><p>Create basic health &amp; damage system</p></li><li><p>Create pickups &amp; bullets</p></li><li><p>Game logic control &amp; enemy spawn</p></li><li><p>Basic level design</p></li><li><p>How to use gizmo to debug</p></li><li><p>Create main menu and game menu with Unity UI system</p></li></ul><p>Please NOTE that this course DOES NOT contain any sound and music assets so far.</p><p>*All of the assets (meshes, animations, VFX, etc.) provided in this course are only for educational purposes, please do not use them in any commercial projects.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of this course, you will have a 3D action game that you can show off to your friends and experiment with your unique ideas.</p><p>Please enroll today, I'm looking forward to seeing you in the course.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>What do YOU want to know about Unity but have been afraid to ask? Do you think your questions are too trivial to become an entire course? Every day Dr&nbsp;Penny de Byl&nbsp;receives messages from her students asking for assistance on a wide variety of topics that would benefit from a short tutorial. &nbsp;In this course, Penny puts her 25 years of game development, research and teaching into practice to answer your questions in a variety of popular short workshop based tutorials. </p><p><strong>Topics covered include:</strong></p><ol><li><p>The Unity Entity Component and Job System</p></li><li><p>Targeting Missiles</p></li><li><p>In-game Quest Systems</p></li><li><p>Reading and Writing to a Database </p></li><li><p>Animating Facial Expressions </p></li><li><p>Introduction to Augmented Reality for Android and iOS</p></li><li><p>Object Pooling</p></li><li><p>Working with Asset Bundles</p></li></ol><p><strong>Contents and Overview</strong></p><p><strong>Section 1:</strong><br>The course begins with a section examining the new Unity Entity Component and Job System where you will build a planet simulation with 50,000 planets that orbit and are under the gravitational influence of four suns.</p><p><strong>Section 2:</strong><br>Following this, a section examining the creation of target-seeking missiles will cover basic line of sight missiles that remain locked onto a target, after being fired, as well as the addition of a waypoint system that gives missiles interesting curved and funky trajectories.</p><p><strong>Section 3:</strong><br>The next section steps through the ground-up creation of an in-game quest system. Starting with a simple third person game environment, you will build a quest system which monitors player progress, as well as cover the Unity fundamentals of the UI system to support its presentation.</p><p><strong>Section 4: <br></strong>In this section you will learn how to access an online database from inside Unity to store game data.&nbsp; Through the use of a free online database service, you will follow along as we create a database and write simple PHP, mySQL and C# to link a Unity application with player details stored on an external server.</p><p><strong>Section 5:<br></strong>If you've ever wanted to add real-time facial animations to your own characters to bring them alive, this section is for you.&nbsp; In it you will add emotional expressions to a character and learn how to blend between them with code.&nbsp; We will also add extra believability to the character by adding blinking and eye gaze dynamics.</p><p><strong>Section 6: <br></strong>Want to learn how to make augmented reality on your mobile phone?&nbsp; This section will step you through developing several augmented experiences that you can try on your Android or Apple devices.&nbsp; Using the Wikitude SDK with a special student license just for being enrolled, you'll have your first AR app up and running in 5 minutes.</p><p><strong>Section 7:</strong></p><p>Object Pooling is a very popular game design pattern that will help you save on memory usage.&nbsp; It's great if you need to create a lot of resources, such as bullets or obstacles.&nbsp; This section will show you how to build such a system that can be applied anywhere in your own games, through the development of an asteroid shooting game.</p><p><strong>Section 8:</strong></p><p>In this section you will learn how to work with Unity's Asset Bundles.&nbsp; These are external resources that you can call into your game at any time.&nbsp; You'll learn how to create an Asset Bundle from scratch and then how to load them into your project at runtime, from both a local drive as well as an online URL.&nbsp; I'll also show you how to load and swap player characters at runtime and how to expand the bundle after a games release to continue to bring in new content.<br></p><p><strong>What students are saying about Penny's courses:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Penny is an excellent instructor and she does a great job of breaking down complex concepts into smaller, easy-to-understand topics.</p></li><li><p>Penny's teaching style is exceptionally well-motivated and illustrated.</p></li><li><p>This course is awesome. The lecturer explains everything you need to know and encourages you to experiment and challenge yourself.</p></li></ol>",

We’ll not use any assets for it, we’ll build this from scratch because it’s a good way to learn the fundamentals of gameplay programming. and then we’ll implement the parkour system on top of it. We’ll create an environment scanner for detecting obstacles in front of the player and we’ll make the player perform <strong>different parkour actions dynamically based on the height and type of the obstacle</strong>. We’ll look at advanced animation techniques like <strong>target matching</strong> that will allow us to adapt the same animation to obstacles of different heights.</p><p>We’ll architect the parkour actions using scriptable objects in Unity so that they’re data-driven &amp; can be created &amp; modified by designers without touching the code. We'll also create a climbing system similar to the one that you see in games like Assassin's Creed.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of this course, you’ll not just create this parkour system. But <strong>you’ll also learn essential game development skills and techniques that you can use throughout your career</strong>.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Python and one of its QT \nbindings, PyQT, has changed the face of GUI development. It allows us to\n build beautiful and powerful GUIs that grab the attention of Python \nprogrammers. QT5 has several advantages over other GUI frameworks such \nas tkinter and wxPython.</p>\n\n<p>In\n this video, we will successfully install PyQt5 and the toolset that \ncontains the QT Designer tool. The QT Designer enables us to develop our\n GUI in a visual manner, using drag and drop to add and position \nwidgets, and we will use it extensively. We will then learn how to \nconvert QT Designer-generated code into pure Python code.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After\n having successfully installed PyQt5, the QT Designer, and all other \nrequired QT tools, we will start out simple, building a Python GUI using\n only a few lines of PyQT5 code. Then, we will build a more complex GUI \nusing QT Designer. Along the way, we will explore many QT widgets and \nlearn how to efficiently lay out our GUI design. We will enhance the \nlook-and-feel of the GUI using CSS styling. We will also connect our GUI\n to a SQL database, which we will create. We decouple the business logic\n code from the UI code, using best practices. At the end of this video \ntutorial, viewers will be able to develop complex GUIs using PyQt5.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About the Author </strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Burkhard Meier</strong> is a \nprofessional software test automation designer, developer, and analyst. \nHe has more than 17 years' professional experience working for several \nsoftware companies in California, USA.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>He is the author of \nPython GUI Programming Cookbook, First and Second Edition. This book is \nalso available as a Packt video course.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>He is also the author of the Python Projects Packt video course. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In his professional \ncareer, he developed advanced in-house testing frameworks written in \nPython 3. He also developed advanced test automation GUIs in Python, \nwhich highly increased the productivity of the software development \ntesting team.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When not dreaming in Python code, he reads programming books about design, likes to go for long walks, and reads classical poetry.</p>",

We start simple and add more to the game as the course goes on.</em></p><p>Included in this course is material for beginners to get comfortable with the interfaces. Please note that we reuse this material in similar courses because it is introductory material. You can find some material in this course in the following related courses:</p><ul><li><p>Unreal Engine 4 &amp; Android Development: Make 6 Games, 12 Apps </p></li><li><p>The ultimate Android course for complete beginners</p></li><li><p>Universal App Development: Code and Make Apps in C# and Java</p></li><li><p>Complete Unity and Android Development: Build Games and Apps </p></li><li><p>Create 19 Low Poly Models &amp; Your First 3D RPG In Unity® C# </p></li><li><p>Complete Unity and Android Development: Build Games and Apps </p></li><li><p>C# Masterclass: Make RPG &amp; Mobile Games in Unity &amp; Blender </p></li><li><p>Build \"The Legend Of Zenda\" Game in Unity and Blender </p></li><li><p>Make a 3D Unity Action Game &amp; Low Poly Buildings in Blender</p></li><li><p>Professional Game Development: 3D Modeling and Unity C#</p></li><li><p>28 Low Poly Models and a Unity® Game - Complete 3D Developer </p></li></ul><p><strong>Why Unity®?</strong></p><p>Unity® is one of the most popular platforms in game development. You can use Unity® to build 2D and 3D games. Unity® is cross-platform, which means it is easy to use with other platforms.</p><p>Then you create the 3D models for the game in Blender. You build all the art assets for the game, including the characters, weapons, cannon, dungeon, and temple. You learn how to integrate your art from Blender into Unity®. </p><p><strong>Why Blender?</strong></p><p>Blender, like Unity®, is a popular production suite that is free to download. Blender is a revolutionary tool for making 3D art digitally. With Blender, you can make art assets for games, like we do in this course. </p><p>Have you ever wanted to learn how to make Android apps? Chances are you have tried but haven't got anywhere. Sometimes the tutorials are either too basic or too complex. What you need is a pre-planned curriculum that shows you how to build apps.</p><p><strong>Look no further because this course is the Number 1 course that will show you how to build apps for Android. Reach a ton of people with your amazing idea today.</strong></p><p><strong>Enroll today!</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p><em>Fellow code warriors, if you've ever considered building 2D or 3D games for the browser, you won't find a better guide than Rocco's just completed course on Udemy. Rocco is a gifted instructor and keeps the information flowing at the right pace while maintaining a very practical emphasis.</em></p><p><em>AND he very thoughtfully avoids confusing users by wearing the same red plaid shirt for every lecture. Check it out!</em></p><p><strong>   - Michael Sample, Director of Engineering @Gliffy</strong></p><p>Are you a <strong>game developer</strong> looking for the ultimate low-friction way to <strong>reach a wider audience </strong>on the web?</p><p>Or are you a <strong>web developer</strong> looking for a mature development environment for bringing <strong>2D and 3D graphical web applications</strong> to life?</p><p>Within the <strong>first ten minutes</strong> of this course, you will be able to<strong> build a 3D app and deploy it to a live website</strong>. Then you'll learn the rich history of Unity and the web, and understand how to deploy browser games to various services including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Github Pages</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Google Cloud / Firebase</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>AWS</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Kickstarter, Patreon, Wordpress and Medium </strong>and more...</p></li></ul><p>Early in the course, you'll learn <strong>three secrets</strong> that will instantly make your game look fantastic in the browser. Then you'll do a deep dive about how to <strong>use images and textures pulled from the web</strong>. You'll learn how to <strong>interface with a web search API </strong>using CORS and JSON, and we'll cover how to <strong>avoid common errors </strong>when exporting your game to WebGL. Finally, you'll learn how to achieve <strong>bi-directional communication between the browser and Unity</strong>.</p><p>This course is NOT a general purpose Unity tutorial, nor is it a general purpose Web development class. There are plenty of those. This IS an intermediate-level topics course that <strong>will spark your imagination with the amazing possibilities of 2D and 3D graphical applications in the browser</strong>.</p><p>While the earlier lessons don't require much coding, <strong>we will use plenty of C#, Javascript, HTML and CSS</strong> in the later lessons. You'll get the most out of this course if you have some development experience with either Unity or the web. But don't worry, <strong>we'll go over all the code line-by-line</strong>, and I'll share various resources and documentation with you that will help you <strong>create awesome browser-based 2D and 3D apps!</strong></p><p>From the instructor:</p><p><em>I have almost twenty years of professional development experience. In the first half of my career I was a professional game developer (Rock Band, The Sims, and many more), and in the second half I specialized in graphical applications for the web (Gliffy diagramming and SIMMER game hosting). </em></p><p><em>I've tried various web-graphics libraries like three.js, babylon.js, phaser and playcanvas. Nothing comes close to the mature development tools contained within Unity3D. I believe </em><strong><em>we are at the dawn of a new era of rich 2D and 3D experiences on the web, and Unity is the killer app that will make it happen.</em></strong></p><p><br></p>",

You will not just be learning dry programming concepts, but applying them immediately to a real RPG as you go.</p><p>We’ll provide the RPG project created so far in the series so that you can practice integrating to an existing complex project. <strong>Every element of the project we touch will be fully explained</strong> and no knowledge of the project will be required.</p><p>In the course we will be building the following from scratch:</p><ul><li><p>Shop and Traits UI</p></li><li><p>Integration between Traits and a modifier system</p></li><li><p>Main menus</p></li><li><p>Barter system giving discounts to player with high charisma</p></li><li><p>Buying and selling</p></li><li><p>Filtering shop items by type</p></li><li><p>Flexible and composable special abilities</p></li><li><p>Cooldown timers</p></li><li><p>Mana and money</p></li></ul><p>In the process of the course <strong>we will cover advanced topics</strong> such as: C# Delegates, Interfaces, Lambdas, Strategy and Composite Patterns.</p><p>You will get full <strong>lifetime access</strong> for a single one-off fee. The creators are qualified and experienced coders and avid gamers, so are able to explain complex concepts clearly, as well as entertain along the way.</p><p>You will have access to a course forum where you can discuss topics on a course-wide basis, or down to the individual video. <strong>Get plugged into our communities of amazing developers</strong> on Facebook (nearly 20k), in our own TA-curated Community (17k views/day), and our student chat group (10k live at any one time).</p><p>The course is still in production with <strong>new videos dropping on a weekly basis</strong>, making now a great time to get involved and help shape its future.</p><p><strong>Shops and Abilities are core to many game genres</strong>. So why not join us and get started improving your game development right now?</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course, we will develop a tiny resource gathering game inspired by famous series like \"Anno\" or \"The Settlers\" using Epic’s fantastic Unreal Engine in Version 5.1. No worries: <strong>All lessons have been tested on Version 5.2 as well!</strong></p><p>We will create a simple building placement system and we will have workers like lumbers and masons looking for resources, gathering them and bringing them back home for processing. The resources will be available to build more stuff and so on.</p><p>At the end, we will have 3 resources: gold, wood and stone - gold will be collected in form of taxes paid by citizens living in houses, wood will be collected by lumbers and stone will be collected by masons. Resources like a tree will deplete after some harvesting and the lumber will look for the next tree nearby to continue harvesting.</p><p>We will be using some nice, colorful 3D models from the permanently <strong>free section of Epic’s market place</strong> as well as animations available for free on <strong>Mixamo</strong>.</p><p>All programming will be done using <strong>Unreal’s blueprint</strong> editor system. All coding will be done <strong>from scratch</strong> and we will use highly flexible approaches to have a cool and expandable base system that can easily be extended to other resources, more complex multi-step production chains, etc.</p><p>There’s <strong>no prior coding or Unreal experience needed</strong> to follow and understand the lessons, some basic knowledge of programming concepts like collections, loops, if-branches and some understanding of vector math will surely help though.</p><p>You should have access to a reasonable modern and fast computer (running either Windows or Mac OS) as Unreal Engine need some decent computing power to run smoothly.</p>",

  "description": "<p>An in depth practical course on <strong>OOP using C++</strong>. We learn the very basics of <strong>OOP </strong>like <strong>Classes and Objects</strong> up to more advanced topics like <strong>move semantics </strong>and <strong>lambda expressions</strong>. We then take those topics and apply them through a complex application that will contain 4 different <strong>arcade games: Tetris, Break-out!, Asteroids and Pacman. We will code 2 of those games together</strong> using the techniques we learned in the previous sections. The other <strong>2 games will be projects</strong> <strong>for students</strong>.</p><p>We'll be making this <strong>arcade app</strong> from <strong>SCRATCH</strong> (mostly), using <strong>SDL</strong> for <strong>window management, input and colour</strong> but that's it! <strong>Everything else will be hand coded by us</strong> so we can get a good understanding of what's happening underneath the hood in game engines. </p><p><strong>What we make from scratch:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Drawing lines and shapes</p></li><li><p>Vectors</p></li><li><p>Polygon fill algorithm</p></li><li><p>2D texturing</p></li><li><p>2D sprite animations</p></li><li><p>2D rotations</p></li><li><p>Loading bitmap files</p></li><li><p>Sprite sheets</p></li><li><p>So much more!</p></li></ul><p>This is an exciting course for students to take their skills to the next level through challenging problems and games. <strong>This is a HARD course</strong>, but if you stick with it (and finish all the exercises and projects), you'll not only be a better programmer than most of your peers, you'll be one step closer to getting that industry job you've been dreaming about.</p><p><strong><em>There’s no risk!</em></strong></p><p>This course comes with a <strong>full 30 day money-back guarantee</strong>. If you are not completely satisfied with the course, Udemy will refund you what you paid - no questions asked.</p><p><strong>Register for the course today!</strong></p>",

Behavior Designer is the industry-standard solution for Behaviortrees and generously provided me with an exclusive Educational License, which they specifically built for this course. So you won't get it anywhere else. </p><p><br></p><p>Also you will of course get full <strong>lifetime access</strong> to the course. </p><p><br></p><p>We'll start with the simplest AI-System that there is, namely <strong>State-Machines</strong>.</p><p>After that we'll improve State-Machines and make them more extensible with the <strong>State-Pattern</strong>.</p><p>Then we'll hit the main topic which is one of the more advanced techniques that are used in Indie- and AAA-Gameproductions alike: <strong>BehaviorTrees.</strong></p><p>Lastly we'll have a glimpse at one of the more experimental AI-Approaches, namely <strong>Genetic Algorithms</strong>,<strong> </strong>which are more of a niche topic but have the potential for very interesting game-mechanics that stand out of the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>Whereas this course is already rather extensive and covers the most important aspects of AI for modern gamedevelopment, I can't possibly cover everything of this huge field. For example I won't address machine learning because this topic alone would fill a whole bunch of courses and really isn't that practical for most Game-AIs because of the lack of control you have over it.</p><p>By the end of the course you'll be confident with the most important AI-Techniques- and Design Patterns for modern Gamedevelopment.</p><p><br></p><p>So what are you waiting for, join me now and start creating astonishing AI-Systems yourself. </p>",

  "description": "<p>A knowledge of design patterns enables developers to improve their codebase, promotes code reuse, and makes the architecture more robust. This course focuses on showing you the practical aspects of smarter coding in Python.</p>\n\n<p>We start off by easing you into the world of design patterns, and helping you brush up on your OOP skills. From there, you'll explore the most widely used patterns and create objects in a manner best suited to the situation. Then we take you through some patterns that will help you identify simple ways to realize relationships between entities. Next, we show you how to encapsulate behavior in an object and delegate requests to it, before we up the ante and delve into some advanced patterns. Last but not least, we'll make you aware of design styles that will hamper your development, rather than improving it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>With this course, thanks to patterns, you will be well equipped to craft faster, cleaner, and smarter applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About the Author </strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tong Qiu</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Colibri is a technology consultancy company founded in 2015 by James Cross and Ingrid Funie.

  "description": "<p>In this course, you will learn how to create inventory systems for your games in Unreal Engine 5 using C++&nbsp;and Blueprints.</p><p>We will create a spatial inventory with item grids for different categories (Equippable, Consumable, and Craftable) and the ability to switch between grids filled with items. Items can be different sizes, each taking up a different number of squares in the grid, and items can be stackable, allowing for splitting, combining, consuming, and dropping items.</p><p>This inventory system is architected for scalability, modularity, and uses Unreal Engine C++&nbsp;best practices. The inventory is coded in its own separate plugin, which can be added to multiple game projects or simply kept in a single project. </p><p>Assets are provided for this course, including:</p><ul><li><p>All 3D&nbsp;meshes for items used, including consumable potions, equippable cloaks, masks, and weapons, and craftable foraging materials.</p></li><li><p>All 2D&nbsp;textures for icons, widgets, menus, borders, and messages.</p></li><li><p>Niagara effects for picking up items</p></li></ul><p>This project uses <strong>Unreal Engine 5.5 </strong>and works in <strong>Unreal Engine 5.6 </strong>- you may use the latest version of Unreal Engine for this course!</p><p>Features of this course include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Spatial inventory </strong>grids and the ability to switch between multiple grids in the inventory to house items of different categories (we implement Equippables, Consumables, and Craftables),</p></li><li><p>An <strong>Item Fragment </strong>system whereby items can be customized by adding modular \"Fragments\" to give them functionality (a well-established software pattern in the games industry). Add a Grid Fragment to make the item capable of taking up multiple squares on the grid - add an Equippable Fragment to make the item equippable, etc.,</p></li><li><p>Item <strong>tooltip popups</strong> showing item attributes and the use of design patterns to make a highly-flexible system where tooltips adapt to an item's fragments to display item information,</p></li><li><p>The ability to <strong>move items</strong> in a spatial inventory,</p></li><li><p><strong>Stackable items</strong> with <strong>stack counts</strong> (just add a Stackable Fragment), supporting max stack sizes, and the ability to split, combine, and drop items in the inventory,</p></li><li><p><strong>Consumable items</strong>, the ability to consume and apply custom behaviors upon item consumption (we will implement potions),</p></li><li><p><strong>Equipment </strong>with <strong>equippable slots</strong>, and actually equipping items of different types (we will implement <strong>cloaks</strong>, <strong>masks</strong>, and <strong>weapons</strong>),</p></li><li><p><strong>Assets will be provided</strong> for this course, including the<strong> character, weapons, equipment, potions, and craftables</strong>, as well as <strong>all UI textures</strong> for inventory menu widgets. Though <strong>you are free to use your own assets</strong>!</p></li><li><p>Everything is programmed to work in a <strong>multiplayer </strong>environment, both <strong>Listen Server</strong> and<strong> Dedicated Servers</strong>. It also works in single-player, <strong>Standalone </strong>games.</p></li><li><p><strong>Items are functional</strong> - not just affecting what we see in the menus, but also what happens <strong>in the game</strong> - the system is coded to be <strong>flexible</strong>, allowing you to program your own functionality when items are consumed/equipped/used, including incorporation with the <strong>Gameplay Ability System (GAS)</strong>. </p></li></ul><p>My students have easily incorporated this inventory into their own projects with little effort.</p><p>We will cover topics from intermediate to advanced Unreal Engine C++. If you have taken my course titled Unreal Engine 5 C++&nbsp;The Ultimate Game Developer Course or have equivalent knowledge, you are ready for this course!</p><p>You will also have access to the Druid Mechanics Discord Community, a community I&nbsp;have created for my students, designed to be your most helpful resource when learning. We are going on 35,000 students and climbing! We're all here to help each other out!</p><p>I hope you enjoy this course as much as I did while creating it!</p><p>Jump in, and let's make some inventories!</p>",

I love how Blender is put into the course to give you the option to create your own weapons.\" - Keith</strong></p><p>\"I like that you guys take the time to explain every single detail. Looking forward to get into the more serious chapters. You rock!\" - Paul Tibulca</p><p><strong>\"I love FPS/Battle Royale games and have been wanting to make my own game for quite a while. The fact that there is a course that teaches people how to make their own Battle Royale game is absolutely amazing. The learning is not too fast-paced or too slow-paced. It's just the right speed and goes in depth for specific assets, modifications etc. This course is amazing!\" - J Dean</strong></p><p>\"So far this course is very good. The instructor takes his time to explain everything and is not rushing. I will update on this comment once I've completed a bit more of the course.\" - Alexander K.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>We at Mammoth Interactive value input from students like you. We check the Q&amp;A and will get back to every Q within 2 business days.</p><p>Do you love Battle Royale games? This is the perfect course for you. Learn how to create a full 3D environment as well as create and animate characters to wield weapons and run a muck as they try to survive your own Battle Royale.</p><p><strong>A wildly successful Kickstarter funded this course</strong></p><p>In this course, you learn how to build your own Battle Royale and 3D Adventure Game with Unity® and Blender. This course is unique because we make both the code and the art for the game from scratch. ​<strong>We teach you the fundamentals of designing, coding, and modeling a 3D game.</strong></p><p>First you design the game and its functionality in Unity®. You learn how to code in C# and build video game levels. Don't worry if you've never coded before. We start simple and add more to the game as the course goes on.</p><p><strong>Why Unity®?</strong></p><p>Unity® is one of the most popular platforms in game development. You can use Unity® to build 2D and 3D games. Unity® is cross-platform, which means it is easy to use with other platforms.</p><p>Then you create the 3D models for the game in Blender. You build all the art assets for the game. You learn how to integrate your art from Blender into Unity®.</p><p><strong>Why Blender?</strong></p><p>Blender, like Unity®, is a popular production suite that is free to download. Blender is a revolutionary tool for making 3D art digitally. With Blender, you can make art assets for games, like we do in this course.</p><p>This course contains many Blender sections to give you an in-depth curriculum of 3D modeling your Battle Royale, not just coding. You can choose to build models from scratch or download them from the source files we provide and import straight into Unity.</p><p><strong>Let's get started</strong></p><p>Included in this course are bonus sections on topics including C# and Java. This is for when you finish your Battle Royale. You get more content at a great price.</p><p>\"Great instructor. Amazing course, very helpful\" - Hussein C.</p><p><strong>Enroll now to join the Mammoth community!</strong></p>",

Then once comfortable with these concepts we will continue to expand upon it by adding 3D models as replacements to the prototype assets. Further expanding on that we will then add sound, music, User Interface and menu's, and so on until our game is complete. Taking it one step at a time and breaking everything down in to small tasks so that no matter your skill level you will not feel overwhelmed.</p><p><br></p><p>I have included over 40 Assignments in the videos that I&nbsp;give to you so that you can practice the skills you have been shown on your own. Practicing using these skills without just following a video will help you remember them and how to use them in real world situations for the future.</p><p><br></p><p>I&nbsp;will also go over how to check the license of assets you find online so that you know how to check if you are allowed to use the assets you find in commercial projects that you may publish in the future. </p><p><br></p><p>LETS&nbsp;GET&nbsp;STARTED!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to Unreal Engine 5 C++ Climbing System, in this course, you’ll learn how to build a robust climbing system completely from scratch with a deep understanding of how to handle the climb physics, create climb locomotion, climb up and down the ledge, hand and leg IK using control rig, vaulting mechanics, hopping capabilities and a range of other exciting features for a robust climbing experience.</p><p><br></p><p>In the first section, we’ll look into how we can handle the movement for our climbing , and start with a new enhanced input with a custom movement component to handle the basic climbing logic. Then we’ll go over how to use different traces to get hold of all the climbable surface info we need, and handle all the physics code needed in order for us to move our character in a custom movement mode. Once we have a working physics, we’re gonna process all the climbable surface info and calculate the velocity and rotation for our climbing. </p><p><br></p><p>In second section, we’re going to take care of climbing up, climbing down, climbing to the left, climbing to the right, climb up the ledge, climb down the ledge, enter and exit the climb state. We’ll begin with a charcter anim instance class in C++ and rebuilding our existing animation blueprint. Then we’ll go through the mixamo animation pipeline and look at how we can make use of mixamo converter to retarget animation. Next, we’ll handle the climb locomotion and create our own algorithms to check if we have reached the floor or the ledge. </p><p><br></p><p>In the third section, we’ll build a control rig for our hand and leg IK to fix the placement issue when we are climbing, and we’ll dive into motion warping and enhanced input system to implement features like vaulting and hopping. We’ll start with a handy climb IK trace function in our control rig, and dynamically adjust the position of our hands and feet based on the surface. Then we’ll go into motion warping and create more algorithms to check which surface is vaultable, and dynamically set our target point during runtime. After we have fully functional vaulting mechanics, we’ll dive deep into enhanced input system and look at how we can use it to create a two key action that only be triggered during climbing. </p><p><br></p>",

We will focus on the general game structure, code structure and how to use design patterns in our game to solve different issues that will arise. By using Unit Tests we will create some degree of certainty that our code will run as it should even after adding new features and refactoring the previously written code.</p><p>Those are mostly overlooked topics in most courses on how to create games. There is a reason for it. They show you how to create a prototype. Your game prototype must be created fast, can be crude and can have bugs. It's role is to get you feedback if your game idea is promising. </p><p>My goal in this course is to give you an idea about broad range of topics mainly connected with programming. On an example of a city builder game we will look at how to use different design patterns, create unit tests and refactor the previously written code to account for the new features that we want to introduce into our game. </p><p><br></p><p>After receiving a couple of reviews I can see that sometimes I can go too fast through some aspects and I don't explain some more basic concepts of the code. Please take this into consideration that some intermediate knowledge of C# and a good understanding on how Unity editor works is crucial for you to get the most out of this course.</p><p>I hope that I can help you improve your coding skills where it comes to game development. At the same time I am sure that not everyone will be satisfied with my delivery and the quick pace at some points. Please know that you have 30 day to apply for a refund. I don't want anyone to feel dissatisfied with their purchase.</p><p>*This course is made using Unity 2019. You should be able to follow along using latest LTS (long term support) version of Unity 2019. </p>",

  "description": "<p>Interested in the intersection of video games and artificial intelligence? If so, you will love Unity ML-Agents.</p><p>Reinforcement Learning with ML-Agents is naturally more intuitive than other machine learning approaches because you can watch your neural network learn in a real-time 3d environment based on rewards for good behavior. It's more fun because you can easily apply it to your own video game ideas rather than working with simplified example problems in a library like OpenAI Gym.</p><p>In this course, we will create a complete game with incredibly challenging AI opponents.</p><ul><li><p>We'll start with an introduction to ML-Agents, including how to use and train the example content.</p></li><li><p>Then, we'll use Blender to make custom assets for our game (you can skip that part if you just want to code).</p></li><li><p>Next, we'll create a full environment for the airplane agents and train them to fly through checkpoints without crashing into obstacles.</p></li><li><p>Finally, we'll take our trained agents and build a full game around them that you can play, including menus for level and difficulty selection.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Important note 1:</strong> <em>We DO NOT cover the foundations of deep learning or reinforcement learning in this course. We will focus on how to use ML-Agents, which abstracts the hard stuff and allows us to focus on building our training environment and crafting rewards.</em></p><p><strong>Important note 2: </strong><em>While the course was originally recorded with ML-Agents version 0.11, we have updated it for version 1.0.</em></p><p>As you work through the course, you'll have plenty of opportunities to customize it and make it your own. At the end, you'll have a complete game that you can share with friends, add to your portfolio, or sell on a game marketplace.</p>",

For the development of this game, it is used Scratch 3.0 because is&nbsp;an educational programming environment&nbsp;that is has&nbsp;an easy graphical interface that it will allow us to drag and drop the right blocks of coding.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>I promise you that it will be a funny and exciting course that it will motivate your students to learn coding in more depth.</strong></p><p>Scratch&nbsp;3.0 is a free programming language and online community where your students can create their own interactive stories, games, and animations.&nbsp;Using Scratch, students can create online projects and develop them into almost anything by using a simple block-like interface. When they are ready, they then share, and also discuss their creations with each other. Scratch was developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the&nbsp;MIT Media Lab.&nbsp;Scratch&nbsp;is designed to help children (ages 8 and up) learn to utilize their imaginations, practice common sense, and, most importantly, to interact with computers.</p><p><strong>Scratch is the best educational programming software for kids available today</strong>. With Scratch, you can create games and&nbsp;interactive art projects&nbsp;all while having lots of fun!</p><p>This course uses the amazing Scratch program developed by MIT to teach coding. This course&nbsp;is meant for:</p><p><strong>-&nbsp;Everybody that is interested in learning to code, from kids to adults,&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Scratch was developed by MIT to teach people to code. It is the best way to learn to code that I have been aware of in my lifetime.</p><p><strong>-&nbsp;Anyone interested in teaching beginning programming as a career or business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Teaching kids to code is becoming big business.&nbsp; Want to start your own&nbsp;coding academy school&nbsp;or get a position as an instructor?&nbsp; They all use Scratch programming, learn&nbsp;Scratch here from a University programming instructor.</p><p><strong>-&nbsp;Anyone that already knows how to code that wants to learn from Scratch&nbsp;Programming&nbsp;and build some fun games.</strong>&nbsp;Why did we get into programming in the first place? Because its fun and Scratch is super fun!&nbsp; No matter your level, you will have fun and learn from Scratch. &nbsp;I know I did and that is what the people at MIT intended.</p>",

  "description": "<p>In this comprehensive course, you’ll build a fully-featured, AAA-quality frontend UI system entirely from scratch using Unreal Engine 5’s Common UI framework and C++. From layered menus to full gamepad support, you’ll learn how to create immersive and modular interfaces designed for real-world projects.</p><p><br></p><p>You’ll start by setting up the core UI foundation. We’ll create a primary layout widget, register widget stacks using gameplay tags, and implement asynchronous functions for pushing widgets onto the screen. Once that’s in place, you’ll build a responsive “Press Any Key” screen and display it using your new widget flow.</p><p><br></p><p>Next, you’ll create a dynamic main menu system. We’ll use Common UI buttons backed by native C++ classes to add contextual button descriptions, action buttons, and a flexible confirmation screen. We’ll also ensure full gamepad support is seamlessly integrated. Along the way, you’ll learn how to structure UI features in a modular, reusable way for both Blueprint and C++ projects.</p><p><br></p><p>Once the core menu is complete, you’ll move on to building a robust options menu. This system will feature tab buttons at the top, a detailed view panel on the right, and support for multiple settings categories including gameplay, audio, graphics, and input. You’ll learn how to combine data objects with Unreal’s Data Registry system to dynamically populate the UI.</p><p><br></p><p>After setting up the structure, we’ll focus on functionality. You’ll implement logic to reset values to default, customize how list entry widgets are generated, and create a custom Game User Settings system to store and load player preferences from config files.</p><p><br></p><p>With that foundation in place, we’ll dive into creating audio and video settings. You’ll add controls for adjusting window mode, resolution, shadow quality, frame rate limit, and more—while managing data dependencies and conditional logic properly for a clean, scalable architecture.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, you’ll implement startup and in-game loading screens that integrate seamlessly into your project’s UI flow, giving players a polished experience from launch to gameplay.</p>",
