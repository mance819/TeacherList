  "description": "<p>This <strong>interactive 1-hour course</strong> is designed to help you <strong>quickly </strong>and <strong>effectively </strong>build <strong>a solid</strong> <strong>foundation </strong>of the <strong>Japanese writing System</strong>. This course offers an <strong>easy </strong>and <strong>comprehensive </strong>approach, including practice in <strong>speaking and listening</strong>.</p><p>☆☆☆</p><p>Ever wanted to learn a new language that’s quite different from your own? Japanese has three types of scripts: hiragana, katakana, and kanji, and they can all be used in one sentence. Now, do you have to learn all of them? It depends on your purpose, but generally, yes. <strong>Should you learn them first before everything else?</strong>&nbsp; <strong>It depends.</strong> If your short-term goal is to read or write, you will need to learn them from the beginning. If your short-term goal is speaking and listening, not necessarily. If you aim to understand and speak long sentences in the long run, knowing the scripts can be beneficial. You can start learning them anytime you’re ready or need to. Feel free to check out my website for free useful resources to learn Hiragana and Katakana.</p><p><br></p><p>In order to serve people with <strong>different purposes</strong>, and people who want to <strong>casually start</strong> learning but also want to build a <strong>solid foundation</strong> to build upon, I created this course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Super Beginner-Friendly:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Easily differentiate the three Japanese characters as they are color-coded (blue for hiragana, green for katakana, and orange for kanji). Roman letters are also provided for added support.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Concise and Informative:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Essential information is hand-picked from linguistics textbooks and turned into easy-to-follow visual material for your intuitive understanding. (Please note linguistics terms are simplified in the course so you can get the image easily. If you have any questions, let me know!)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Interactive:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Designed to make you “think” and “experience”. There are also light role-playing exercises to get you ready for real conversations.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Focuses on Speaking and Listening:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Mimicking can help your mouth and brain remember the sound. You don't have to practice aloud if you're not comfortable, but you can give it a try and see how it goes. (Tip:D You can wear earphones and keep your voice slightly lower than the sample speech so you can still hear it and can adjust your speech to it.)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Uses Natural Expressions:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Learn to use Japanese as it is naturally spoken. Do you feel the Japanese sentences in your textbooks/apps are unnatural? For example, we don’t often say the words <em>anata</em> (you) and <em>watashi </em>(I) (as well as <em>kare</em> (he), <em>kanojo</em> (she), and <em>karera</em> (they)) in daily conversation, but in a lot of apps and materials, these are often used without context. With this course, you can practice natural expressions in context.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Practical:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Emphasis is on practical usage. Grammar rules are not a math equation that applies in all situations so it would be good to have a little more explanation with context on each structure.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Ready to Get Started?</strong></p><p>Are you ready to join this 1-hour course and build a quick and solid foundation of your Japanese skills? You will learn basic Japanese in an <strong>easy</strong>, <strong>interactive</strong>, and <strong>practical </strong>way with a native teacher through light <strong>role-plays</strong> and <strong>short</strong> and <strong>in-depth explanations</strong>!</p><p>Feel free to ask any questions in the Q&amp;A section in the course, or you can send me an email through my website.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the course! :)</p>",

  "description": "<p>The first section of the course covers the stages involved in the process of writing an essay, including but not limited to analyzing topics, planning responses, and writing paragraphs. All aspects of writing a standard 5-paragraph essay are covered, with particular emphasis on paragraph structure. The second section provides language input to help you improve your vocabulary (through the use of stronger verbs), sentence connections (through cohesive devises and referencing) and punctuation. If you feel that your language skills are adequate, you are more than welcome to skip the second section and mostly focus on section 1. At the end of the course, there is an assignment that will take you 8 days to complete. Once you have completed the assignment, submit your essays and wait for feedback. </p><p>To make the most of this course, it is best that you watch each lesson more than once and pause when needed. Remember that becoming a proficient writer takes extensive practice, dedication and time. Be sure to read about a wide range of topics as much as possible to become faster at generating ideas, and do not show off by using big vocabulary words. Be concise and communicate your ideas by developing them with as much detail as possible. The more you read, the better you can write. </p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Harry Potter is one of my favorite films. </strong><em>I once learned English through it myself. </em></p><p>I really wanted to understand the speech of my favorite actors in the original. This is something where Google Translate is unlikely to help, due to the many cultural nuances that need to be understood through experience. That's why I created this course for you—to share my experience and understanding of the cultural nuances of English in the context of the film <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</em> (2001).</p><p><br></p><p>You will have the opportunity to hear all (!) the lines and dialogues from the film in the original! The course is structured so that we first listen to the phrase in the original, then analyze the words and grammar from that phrase.</p><p><br></p><p><em>I created this course for my mom, relatives, close friends, and my students—many of whom have long asked me to create a course like this! It was a long and laborious process—creating a course based on a film like Harry Potter involves more than just knowing English :) I had to master new skills, including studio work, video editing, shot composition, and sound quality.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I hope you appreciate the effort put into this!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly, this course will indeed be interesting to everyone studying English. As an experienced English teacher, I can say it will be useful for both advanced learners and beginners.</p><p><br></p><p>I aimed to present the material in a balanced way so that it would be engaging <em>for everyone</em>!</p><p><br></p><p>Let's together understand the original English speech of the beloved characters in the Harry Potter film!</p>",

  "description": "<p>    Hello, everyone, welcome to Chinese idioms season 2: learn 80 most commonly used Chinese idioms through a comic story.</p>    Chinese idioms were originated from the ancient Chinese historical and philosophical works, crystallizing the wisdom of Chinese culture through thousands of years. They have become familiar daily language of today spoken by ordinary Chinese people in daily life. Being able to use them adroitly will lend vividness, authenticity, humor and refinement to your conversation and writing. The language in the Chinese idiom stories studied in this course encompasses the realms of politics, literature, military, philosophy and religion, which will enrich your Chinese vocabulary in all fields. While the season 1 of this course emphasizes the link of Chinese idiom stories with the four greatest indigenous classical Chinese philosophies, and taught 16 Chinese idioms and trace their source stories to Chinese philosophical and historical works, this season 2 aims to teach a much greater amount of idioms--80 in total-- by making you learn a piece of hilarious essay (taught in 11 parts) made of all these 80 idioms, so that you would easily memorize and understand their usage in sentence context that is hilarious and memorable. <br>     For each idiom story, there are three lectures, the first lecture is text practice of the idiom stories: I will lead you to learn the vocabulary, explain to you sentence by sentence the text, and lead you to read the text twice, and ask you questions about the text; the second lecture will teach you how to use the idioms in sentences, both grammatically and meaningfully. I will also explain briefly the source stories of most of these idioms. The third lecture will be my talking-head video speaking these stories, so that you can review them and understand them without the text. <br>    Chinese idiom stories are living fossils of language that are still extremely popular in daily conversation today, and will definitely lend humor, refinement, vividness and authenticity in your communication with Chinese people. You will find your Chinese acquire a new height with this course. If you go to China or talk to Chinese people, the use of a considerable amount of these Chinese idioms will make your Chinese truly sound sophisticated, refined and humorous, and make you easily be regarded as a true insider of Chinese culture.",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to <em>Master Italian with 800 AI Conversations</em>, a comprehensive and immersive language course brought to you by Lingo Training. This video course is designed for learners who want to master Italian by listening, repeating, and understanding real-life conversations in an intuitive and natural way. Whether you're a beginner or an intermediate learner, this course will guide you step-by-step through 800 practical dialogues that cover a wide range of topics, scenarios, and vocabulary.</p><p>What makes this course stand out is its methodology—based on scientific language acquisition principles—and its powerful use of modern technology. Each dialogue is performed by state-of-the-art artificial intelligence voices that sound remarkably human, clear, and expressive. The audio experience is paired with synchronized on-screen subtitles, so you can follow along in Italian with immediate English translations. This dual-exposure technique enhances comprehension and builds a strong mental connection between the languages.</p><p>Every lesson is structured to maximize your learning:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Natural Dialogue Playback</strong> – First, the full Italian conversation is played without interruptions, allowing you to absorb the flow, tone, and natural rhythm of spoken Italian. This helps train your ear to authentic pronunciation and phrasing, which is essential for developing listening fluency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Listen-and-Repeat Mode</strong> – After hearing the dialogue naturally, you’ll hear it again—but this time, with clear pauses between each line. This allows you to repeat after each speaker, practicing your pronunciation and memorizing sentence structures with proper intonation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Real-Time Translations</strong> – While the dialogue plays, you’ll see the transcription of each Italian sentence followed immediately by its English translation. This real-time reference lets you understand every word without confusion or delay. You’re never left wondering what a sentence means.</p></li><li><p><strong>Downloadable PDFs</strong> – Every dialogue comes with a downloadable PDF file containing the full Italian script and English translation. You can study offline, highlight important phrases, or print them out for review. These files are great for revisiting key dialogues or practicing with a partner.</p></li><li><p><strong>Progressive Learning</strong> – The 800 conversations are organized by difficulty and theme, beginning with simple greetings, daily routines, and common expressions. As you advance through the course, you’ll tackle more complex topics such as travel, work, emotions, idioms, and cultural nuances.</p></li><li><p><strong>One-Time Purchase, Lifetime Access</strong> – You only pay once to access the entire course. There are no subscriptions, hidden fees, or extra costs. After enrolling, you can study at your own pace and revisit the material as many times as you like. Your access never expires.</p></li></ol><p>This course is perfect for learners who:</p><ul><li><p>Want to learn Italian in a practical, conversational way</p></li><li><p>Prefer audio-based methods with visual support</p></li><li><p>Need flexible study options for their own pace and schedule</p></li><li><p>Appreciate lifetime access to high-quality content</p></li><li><p>Value affordability without sacrificing quality</p></li><li><p>Seek to improve speaking, listening, and comprehension skills simultaneously</p></li></ul><p>By the end of the course, you will have listened to and practiced over 800 authentic dialogues in Italian, each designed to give you a real-world foundation in the language. You will be able to:</p><ul><li><p>Comprehend spoken Italian in various situations</p></li><li><p>Express yourself clearly and confidently in Italian</p></li><li><p>Recognize and use commonly used words and phrases</p></li><li><p>Mimic natural speech patterns and improve pronunciation</p></li><li><p>Understand cultural expressions and everyday slang</p></li><li><p>Study effectively with structured repetition and support materials</p></li></ul><p>A Modern Approach to Language Learning</p><p>Many traditional courses focus heavily on grammar and vocabulary lists, which often lead to frustration or limited speaking ability. Our approach flips the model. Instead of memorizing disconnected rules, you’ll learn by <em>experiencing</em> the language—just as you learned your first language as a child. By hearing real conversations, repeating what you hear, and understanding the meaning immediately, you develop a natural command of Italian.</p><p>The power of repetition in context cannot be overstated. When you hear and say the same phrase in a meaningful way, the brain retains it far better than through rote memorization. With our “listen and repeat” system, you'll engage both your auditory and verbal memory, which boosts retention and accelerates fluency.</p><p>And because our dialogues use AI-generated voices, you benefit from consistent pronunciation, rhythm, and clarity. Unlike low-quality text-to-speech programs, our voices sound realistic and engaging—helping you immerse yourself fully in the learning experience.</p><p>What’s Inside the Course?</p><p>The course contains:</p><ul><li><p>800 high-quality video lessons</p></li><li><p>Hours of audio-based learning material</p></li><li><p>Subtitles in Italian and English</p></li><li><p>Downloadable PDF transcripts and translations</p></li><li><p>Clear, human-like AI voices for every conversation</p></li><li><p>Listen-and-repeat training structure</p></li><li><p>Instant lifetime access with no expiration</p></li><li><p>Compatibility with all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)</p></li></ul><p>Each section is short and manageable, allowing you to complete lessons in just a few minutes per day. You can study in the morning, during your commute, at lunch, or before bed—whatever fits your schedule best. The platform allows you to bookmark lessons, take notes, and track your progress as you go.</p><p>Start Speaking Italian Today</p><p>Whether you want to travel to Italy, connect with Italian-speaking friends and family, boost your career opportunities, or simply enjoy learning a new language, this course provides the tools you need to succeed.

  "description": "<p>English is becoming more and more important as the language of international business. Doing business in English makes a lot of people nervous, especially with a fear of making mistakes, understanding colleagues, and writing emails. </p><p><br></p><p>But it doesn't have to be so stressful. In less than one month with this course, you will feel much better about doing business in English. With daily videos, notes, and practice materials, you will learn the most important vocabulary and most typical mistakes that are made when doing business in English. </p><p><br></p><p>Each daily lesson is designed to take about 10-20 minutes to complete. Each day has a video (with English subtitles) as well as a downloadable PDF including notes and practice exercises (with solutions) to help you learn one new topic each day. Every five days, there is a review that covers the material from all the previous days, starting from day 1. </p><p><br></p><p>The most typical mistakes are based on my experience as an English Teacher in the Czech Republic. However, the course is useful for not only Czech speakers of English, but speakers of other Slavic languages and beyond. The course is best for those with B1-B2 level, and it is possible with at least a level of A2. </p><p><br></p><p>I&nbsp;am also the author of the popular book 25 Days from Czenglish to English, a similar concept that helps Czech speakers of English fix the 25 most typical mistakes in everyday conversation. I love making useful materials to help students learn English without using traditional textbooks. </p><p><br></p><p>Happy studying! :)&nbsp;</p>",

  "description": "<p>This course has been made for advanced students of English who would like to sharpen their skills with modern fiction. I have chosen one text (<strong>Donna Tartt's <em>The Secret History</em></strong>), so I advise students to read a few pages of the book to see if they like the novel. There are 8 sections in the course, and each section focuses on the different grammar and vocabulary that appear in each chapter of the book.&nbsp; Donna Tartt reads her own story aloud, so students are encouraged to read the story or to listen to the audio book (easy to find either for free), or to do both. Once you have read the first chapter, watch my lectures and complete the quizzes that correspond to that chapter; then, I recommend you retell the story to your speaking partner or teacher, as I believe that retelling stories is the best way to make swift progress with speaking. </p><p>By the end of the course, students will have covered tenses, past modals, questions, conditionals, subjunctive, so v such, perfect infinitives, perfect gerunds, inversion, phrases and clauses, adverb collocations, phrasal verbs, articles, correlative conjunctions, prepositions, relative clauses, and many vocabulary topics. I encourage students to ask questions, and I usually respond within 24 hours.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Phonics is one of the most important foundations of the English language.</p><p>It helps us read, write, speak and listen and allows us to learn on our own without relying on remembering each word we learn. Instead, we can simply use phonics to sound each word out. </p><p>However, phonics is rarely taught in schools, especially in ESL countries. In Native English counties, phonics is picked up in everyday listening and speaking. But ESL countries don't have that luxury. Most schools also don't teach phonics because it is difficult to teach and often requires Native English Speaking teachers to teach, which is not always possible.</p><p>At Happy Learning Club, we acknowledge the importance of phonics and so are pleased to offer this course completely free to help students learn everything there needs to know from basic to advanced phonics. Phonics empowers students to learn on their own, to read by themselves, and to speak like native speakers. We hope you enjoy our Phonics course with us and have fun learning every day! </p><p>Course Outline</p><p>25+ lessons with more updates every week.</p><p>1. Phonics of the Alphabet</p><p>2.

  "description": "<p>Because Shakespeare's plays were written in 16th and 17th-century English, the language is difficult to decipher.

This gives the student a view of the period and a better understanding of the way the play would have been performed in the Elizabethan times, what the audience would have added to the performance, and how that would have impacted the actors.</p><p>Susan Allin graduated from Stellenbosch University, South Africa, in 1981, her major subjects being English, Psychology, and History. She has taught English, History, and various other subjects across South Africa since then. </p><p>As Shakespearian plays and poetry have been an important part of the English curriculum, she has had the opportunity to teach students on second-language, and even third-language levels. This provides her with the ability to explain Shakespearian plays to students who were not brought up speaking and writing in English.</p><p>Students in her final year matric classes have excelled, as she has managed to teach the concepts in a manner that they could understand.</p><p>If you (or your child) are currently studying this play, it is highly recommended that you sign up for this very comprehensive course.</p><p><br></p>",

Let's get started!</p><p><br></p><p>This course is mainly for 3 groups of people (but everyone is welcome to try it out):</p><p>- Tigrinya diaspora who are fluent speakers but never got a chance to learn how to read and write</p><p>- Tigrinya diaspora who are starting from scratch and would like to learn to write their name and common one-word sentences</p><p>- Ferenji (foreigners) who are married to Habesha or doing volunteer work and would like to learn more about the language</p><p><br></p><p>This ain't your grandma's abugida! The course is organized in a way that creates groups of fidelat that either look or sound the same to make them easier to remember. <strong>This course mostly focuses on Eritrean pronunciation and spelling, but Tigray pronunciation and fidelat only used in Ethiopia, are also explained.</strong> And the best part is that the last two sections of the course are full of practical tips to help you use everything you've learned in real life! Once you've gone through it, with Udemy's FOREVER&nbsp;ACCESS, you'll have free access for life, including any future updates made to the course!</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>(If you have a large group of learners and would like a bulk order discount code, contact me directly!)</em></strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>    Hello everyone, welcome to Tao Te Ching--the book of Te: learn the wisdom and language of the most translated Taoist philosopher. Tao Te Ching is a fundamental text for both philosophical and religious Taoism, and strongly influenced Legalism, Confucianism and Chan Buddhism, which when first introduced into China was interpreted through the use of Taoist concepts. Many Chinese artists, including poets, painters, calligraphers and gardeners, have been greatly influenced by Tao Te Ching. Its influence spread widely outside East Asia, and is among the most translated works in world literature, only next to Bible. <br>     The passages in Tao Te Ching are ambiguous, with topics ranging from advice for rulers and profound religious experience of cosmic origin of Tao and its application in all realms of life. The book has 81 chapters ,this course teaches the second half of the book: the Book of Te. The central values of Tao Te Ching are: the ineffability of Tao, the privileging of the female attributes, the force of Yin--such as softness, yielding, humility, resilience and non-action effecting all actions. The returning movement as the movement of Tao, the interchangeability of the opposites, political rule with least interference, philosophical and religious experience of vacuity and power of nothingness.  It believes that the masters of Tao do nothing, while leave nothing undone. It is only when Tao is lost, that there are the artificial human standards of virtue, benevolence, righteousness and ritual. It believes that the great rulers are like the ocean, residing in a low place, and through its humility all states flow down and gather to it without resorting to military force and coesive measures. <br> Tao Te Ching has been translated into Western languages over 250 times, its cryptic and poetic language is a famous puzzle which everyone would like to resolve. It exerted a profound influence on western philosophies: its dialects formed  Leibniz' and Hegelian dialectics, and influenced Schopenhauer and Nietzsche's opposition of the world of ideal and the world of the will. Many western thinkers, upon the disaster of the First World war and the contemplation of the ruins of western civilization, had looked upon Lao Zi's ideal of rulership in the vein \"performing non-action to achieve all action\" and freedom from state greed and violence as a welcoming antidote to the ruins of western civilization. <br>    In learning the course, print out the PDF of Tao Te Ching text in the introduction chapter, and with it in hand, study the selected chapters in the following lectures (because there is no subtitle of the text in the video). For each lecture, I will explain word by word the meaning of the classical Chinese text, and then I will explain to you the philosophical implication of these texts, often comparing it with other schools of Chinese philosophies. Finally I will lead you to read the text twice so that you can recite and memorize them.</p>",

At mean time I will be adding more into this course. Take advantage of this offer and share it with a friend. Pretty soon when I have it all finished, it wont be free anymore :) </p><p><br></p><p>Luciana Ribas</p><p>Portuguese Today Founder</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><em>Basic 300 Chinese words</em> course is one of the Chinese vocabulary series.</p>\n\n<p><strong>By the end of the course</strong>, you should know the 300 most common words and how to use them in a sentence. It is also the word list of the official Chinese test HSK level 2. After completing this course, we recommend you take an HSK 2 practice test. If you wish you can then take an official test to get a certification.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How the course structured?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In these courses:<br>* The word list is broken up into short lessons. Every lesson has a theme to make it easier to remember.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>* As you progress through the course, each new lesson incorporates words and characters from the earlier lessons. This structure results in repetition which should help you with memorization.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What materials and services are included?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>（24 Instruction videos with 50 quizzes + PDF + Quizlet flash cards + Mp3 audio + 45 min online tutoring (optional)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Besides instruction video with quizzes and script PDF</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>* The mp3 audio will be provided for each lesson to help you improve your listening skills.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>* The Quizlet flashcards for each lessons are a great learning tool. You can log in and review the flashcards and take quizzes any time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Additionally</strong>, in XM Mandarin, we believe speaking the language with a native speaker is very important for language learners. So we are happy to offer every enrolled student a free 45 minutes online tutoring. Of course, it's optional.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pinyin learner-friendly</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is also specially designed for the Only Pinyin learners. You don't have to recognize the Chinese characters. In HSK 2 all the characters come with Pinyin alongside.</p>\n\n<p>So if you are Chinese newbie or beginner learner who is looking for a structure, I would recommend this course. <br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to try before you buy, no problem, just take a look at the trial lessons and download the free materials first.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I look forward to seeing you guys in the course!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Your instructor: Xiao Min (Beijing, China)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Welcome to the most comprehensive Russian conversation course ever created for English speakers.</strong></p><p>If you've ever dreamed of speaking Russian fluently and naturally, this course is designed just for you. With 800 real-life conversations powered by advanced artificial intelligence voices, you’ll immerse yourself in the Russian language like never before. Each video lesson features audio of native-like dialogues, accurate English translations in real-time, and transcriptions you can follow along with — all while enjoying a hands-free and stress-free learning experience.</p><p>This course is not just another vocabulary or grammar-based program. It is built to help you <em>think and respond in Russian</em> through authentic spoken interactions. The content is ideal for all levels — whether you're a beginner just getting started or an intermediate learner looking to boost your fluency.</p><p>What Makes This Course Unique?</p><p><strong>1. Real Russian in Real Situations</strong><br>Each of the 800 dialogues is crafted to reflect how Russian is actually spoken in daily life — from simple greetings and shopping to work discussions, travel, dating, emergencies, and more. You won’t be memorizing isolated phrases; you’ll be absorbing the language in context, just like you learned your native tongue.</p><p><strong>2. Two-Step Learning Process in Every Lesson</strong><br>Every video is divided into two parts:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1: Natural Dialogue Playback</strong> – You hear the conversation flow naturally from beginning to end without interruption. This helps you internalize the rhythm, tone, and structure of Russian speech.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2: Listen and Repeat Mode</strong> – The same conversation is repeated, but this time with clear pauses between each sentence so you can repeat out loud, reinforcing pronunciation and memorization.</p></li></ul><p>This dual approach activates both passive and active language skills — improving comprehension and building your speaking confidence.</p><p><strong>3. Voice Technology That Feels Human</strong><br>Unlike older courses that use robotic or monotone speech, our dialogues are voiced by state-of-the-art artificial intelligence trained on real human speech. The result? A clear, expressive, and lifelike sound that mimics how native Russians truly speak. You’ll get used to native pace, intonation, and emotion from the first lesson.</p><p><strong>4. Instant Translations to English</strong><br>Each sentence is accompanied by real-time English subtitles, helping you understand every word without having to stop or rewind. Over time, your brain will start recognizing sentence structures and vocabulary faster, accelerating your fluency.</p><p><strong>5. Full Access to Printable PDFs</strong><br>All dialogues are available as downloadable PDF files. Each PDF contains the Russian text, the English translation, and space to take your own notes. These printable materials are perfect for offline study, highlighting, or taking with you on the go.</p><p><strong>6. Learn at Your Own Pace, On Any Device</strong><br>Because the entire course is video-based and hosted on Udemy, you can access the material anywhere — from your desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone. With lifetime access and no subscription fees, you’re free to learn whenever and wherever you want.</p><p><strong>7. Designed for Long-Term Retention</strong><br>The spaced repetition built into the course structure ensures that new words and expressions are encountered multiple times across different contexts. This reinforcement helps solidify your memory and builds the intuition needed to speak Russian naturally.</p><p><strong>8. One-Time Payment, Lifetime Learning</strong><br>Unlike language apps that charge monthly or yearly subscriptions, this course offers <em>unlimited, lifetime access</em> for a single affordable price. That means you can revisit the material anytime in the future, whether to review or refresh your skills.</p><p>Course Content Overview:</p><p>The 800 conversations are organized into thematic units covering a wide variety of real-world situations:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Unit 1: Greetings and Introductions</strong><br>Meet and greet people in Russian, introduce yourself, and ask about others.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unit 2: Daily Routines and Home Life</strong><br>Talk about your schedule, describe your home, and share details about your day.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unit 3: Shopping and Restaurants</strong><br>Practice useful expressions for buying items, ordering food, and handling payments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unit 4: Travel and Transportation</strong><br>Learn how to navigate airports, ask for directions, and use public transportation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unit 5: Work and Business</strong><br>Understand conversations about job responsibilities, meetings, and office culture.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unit 6: Relationships and Emotions</strong><br>Explore how to express feelings, talk about friendships, love, and social life.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unit 7: Emergencies and Health</strong><br>Prepare for situations like visiting a doctor, calling for help, or handling accidents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unit 8: Culture, Weather, and More</strong><br>Discuss Russian culture, seasons, hobbies, and opinions in everyday conversations.</p></li></ul><p>Each unit contains 20 conversations, ensuring that you encounter vocabulary in many different contexts — a proven way to deepen understanding and fluency.</p><p>Who is this course for?</p><p>This course is ideal for:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Complete beginners</strong> who want to learn Russian from scratch using natural speech</p></li><li><p><strong>Intermediate learners</strong> looking to expand vocabulary and improve pronunciation</p></li><li><p><strong>Travelers and expats</strong> preparing to visit or live in Russian-speaking countries</p></li><li><p><strong>Language enthusiasts</strong> who love structured, immersive methods</p></li><li><p><strong>Professionals and students</strong> needing conversational Russian for business, study, or daily life</p></li></ul><p>No prior knowledge of Russian is required. You can begin right away — all you need is curiosity, commitment, and a desire to speak Russian confidently.</p><p>Why Choose Lingo Training?</p><p>At Lingo Training, we specialize in AI-assisted language courses that combine modern technology with immersive teaching principles.

  "description": "<p>If you are travelling to Jordan for a short or long stay, you will need to communicate with people there. The main language in Jordan is Arabic. People there use the Jordanian dialect (colloquial) in the day to day life. This course offers you the opportunity to learn - step by step – the most important and common Arabic words and phrases used in Jordan. This course will make it easy for you to learn lots of vocabularies, verbs in the present and in the past, adjectives (masculine and feminine), pronouns, the time, the weekdays, numbers and much more. Also, you will learn letters and pronunciation. You will learn all what you need to hold a basic conversation in Jordanian dialect. By learning the Jordanian dialect, you will be able to communicate with people from other Arabic countries.</p><p>As the first step in learning any language is to learn letters, several lectures in this course are dedicated to the pronunciation of all Arabic letters. Some letters in Arabic letters are hard to be pronounced by non Arabic people. Those letters have been identified and explained with examples and pronunciation. This will help the learners to pronounce the words correctly in Arabic (Jordanian dialect).</p>",

  "description": "<p>In HSK 3 Grammar, we cover 79 grammatical points, use 1000 sentences to explain the detail usage.&nbsp; This Normative Grammar Level syllabus is based on New Standards for International Chinese Language Education, which started from July 1, 2021.&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>Chinese Grammar is a concept that has been borrowed from Western languages, and in certain senses, Chinese grammar does not exist. The greatest truths are often the simplest, and this holds true for Chinese grammar as well. Simply put, Chinese grammar involves the construction of character sequences, similar to the way LEGO bricks are assembled. I refer to this approach as my \"LEGOO Mandarin\" method. However, in a more complex sense, Chinese grammar can be quite challenging. In this course, I will present the simplest truths in my own way, and by following my guidance, you will be able to quickly master Chinese grammar and also learn some reading skills that will prove useful in future exams.&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>Understanding the basic sentence structure in Chinese is crucial for learning the language. Unlike English, Chinese sentences do not require the use of auxiliary verbs and are typically composed of subject, predicate, and object in that order. The subject usually comes at the beginning of the sentence, followed by the predicate and then the object. For example, \"我喜欢中国菜\" (wǒ xǐ huān zhōng guó cài) translates to \"I like Chinese food\" with the subject being \"我\" (wǒ) meaning \"I,\" the predicate being \"喜欢\" (xǐ huān) meaning \"like,\" and the object being \"中国菜\" (zhōng guó cài) meaning \"Chinese food.\" Keep in mind that this is just the basic structure and there can be variations and exceptions depending on the sentence and context.</p><p><br></p><p>In the 2021 version of the HSK exam, there are 9 levels, ranging from HSK 1 to HSK 9. The new standards for international Chinese language education include a revised syllabus, which emphasizes the development of communication skills, cultural understanding, and practical application of the language. The HSK exam is widely recognized as a measure of Chinese language proficiency, and passing it can enhance one's academic and career prospects. </p><p><br></p><p>HSK 3 is the third level of the HSK exam Version 2021, which tests the proficiency of non-native Chinese speakers. It assesses their ability to communicate in Chinese in everyday situations, such as shopping, ordering food, and asking for directions. HSK 2 focuses on basic grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structures. The vocabulary requirement for the HSK 3 test is about 973 words in Version 2021 (comparing with 600 word in Version 2009), which covers basic grammar structures and commonly used sentence patterns.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Russian letters seem complicated? No panic- many of them are exactly the same as English ones. In this course I explain the pronunciation of Russian letters based on their English equivalents. With the examples of English words you will get to know how the letter is pronounced. All letters are highlighted in different colors so you will know what you are working with. Colors let you capture the difference. The way I pronounce the words-is very clear and slow so you can easily identify the word lesson after lesson. Russians do not usually speak the way I did in lessons, but I did it on purpose so you can understand. And no worries, if you speak this way- it will be understandable and still good for a beginner.&nbsp; In 8 lessons you will learn how to read, write and build sentences in Russian. By the end of the ``Starter pack-1`` you will have learned around 51 verb,24 adjectives and roughly 150 words.</p><p>We will learn:</p><p>Russian alphabet</p><p>Personal &amp; possessive pronouns</p><p>Gender of nouns</p><p>Declension of adjectives</p><p>Plural form of nouns</p><p>Present, Past, Future Simple &amp; their Question &amp; Negative form.</p><p>Question words</p><p>Verbs of motion</p><p>Conjunctions</p><p>Numerals (from 1 to 1000)</p><p>Conjugation of irregular verbs</p><p> </p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to Lesson 2 of \"Minna no Nihongo\"! In this lesson, we will continue building on the foundations you learned in Lesson 1. The focus will be on expanding your ability to talk about objects and using more vocabulary and sentence structures.</p><p>Key Focus Areas:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Talking About Objects</strong>: In this lesson, you will learn how to identify and talk about various objects around you. We will introduce the sentence pattern \"This is…\" to help you point out items. For example, \"This is a pen\" or \"That is a book.\" These simple phrases will help you describe and refer to everyday things in your surroundings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Demonstrative Pronouns</strong>: You will also learn how to use demonstrative pronouns like \"this,\" \"that,\" and \"that over there.\" In Japanese, these words help you specify the location of objects in relation to the speaker. Understanding how to differentiate between \"this\" (near you), \"that\" (near the listener), and \"that over there\" (away from both) is important for clear communication.</p></li><li><p><strong>Questions and Responses</strong>: You will practice asking and answering questions about objects, such as \"What is this?\" and \"Is this your book?\" This will help you engage in simple conversations where you can ask for or give information about items around you.</p></li><li><p><strong>Possession</strong>: Another key concept in this lesson is expressing possession. You will learn how to say \"my\" or \"your\" to indicate ownership of something. For example, \"This is my pen\" or \"Is that your bag?\" These phrases will allow you to talk about what belongs to you or someone else.</p></li><li><p><strong>Yes/No Questions</strong>: You will continue practicing how to form and answer yes/no questions. For instance, you will learn to ask, \"Is this a pen?\" and respond with \"Yes, it is\" or \"No, it isn't.\" This will give you the confidence to confirm or deny information in conversations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vocabulary Expansion</strong>: We will introduce more everyday items and objects, such as pens, books, computers, bags, and watches. Learning these words will allow you to talk about common objects and improve your ability to navigate basic conversations.</p></li></ol><p>Goal of the Lesson:</p><p>By the end of this lesson, you should be able to talk about and describe objects around you, ask questions about them, and express possession. You will also practice using demonstrative pronouns and expanding your vocabulary to communicate more effectively in everyday situations. Let’s continue making progress together, step by step!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Bonjour et bienvenue :)</strong></p><p>Hello and welcome,</p><p>I created <strong>2 Minute French</strong> as a way to make learning French <strong>easier</strong> than ever before and <strong>accessible</strong> to everybody. You can go from knowing no French at all to putting together your own sentences in just a few minutes.</p><p>In this course, I have prepared <strong>grammar lessons</strong>, <strong>vocabulary</strong>, and some of the most used <strong>verbs</strong> in French. Likewise, I added some <strong>practical activities</strong> and <strong>games</strong> to each section in order to learn French quickly and easily !</p><p>The lessons are <strong>focused</strong>, <strong>practical</strong> and <strong>effective</strong>. You will build language skills that you can use straight away in real world situations.</p><p>It's much better to study for just two minutes once a day than to study for two hours once a week, because it will quickly become a habit that you will do without thinking, and by doing this, you are going to become a much more consistent learner, and <strong>consistency</strong> <strong>is the key to success !</strong></p><p>Feel free to watch the introduction section and the previous videos to discover how the course is structured.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the course. Please, use the <strong>Q&amp;A</strong> section so we can resolve any confusion or add additional things if necessary !</p>",

I know many of you don’t show much interest in grammars, and it’s a course that mainly aims at expressing, but it’s highly recommended to go through this part for two reasons. Firstly, there are some conclusions or substitutes of certain expressions for certain scenario, you could learn couple of alternative ways to express the sam meaning. You could choose your favorite ones to use. Secondly, we will explain some important structures in the dialogue, with which you could easily create your own sentences and express your own idea in daily communication. So, sounds like it worths your time.</p><p>4)In part5 we will study the whole dialogue, meanwhile we will also review the new vocabulary and key grammars in previous parts of this lesson, which is a perfect process to check and memorize what we’ve learned.</p><p>5)Last but not least, we will provide you with 10 to 20 very practical supplementary expressions you are very likely to use in the scenario. We would like to encourage you to repeat out loud and to get familiar with the tones of each sentence. Hopefully, you could start to use them in your daily life right after the course.</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Hello everyone,</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As you know, China is among the most powerful countries, and therefore, the demand for China and Chinese is increasing day by day.&nbsp; People generally think that Chinese is a very difficult language and they hesitate to start learning it. But Chinese is not as difficult a language as it seems. The characters are intimidating at first and are considered difficult to memorize. But as you will notice during the course and I will constantly emphasize, the characters are not that different from each other. During the tutorial I will talk about the relationships between the characters and it will be much easier to keep in mind that way.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this tutorial series, I will teach about 100 Chinese sentences. One of the most useful points of learning a language with sentences is that you will see the words you have learned in many different sentences, so it will be very difficult for you to forget and you will be able to understand them much more easily. Another point is that we will learn the sentences that you can use in daily conversation, that is, you will be able to use the sentences we learned directly from the stories or similar sentences when talking to a Chinese friend. This will allow you to speak fluently.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I prepared this course for those who don't know anything about Chinese, so you don't need any foundation. Try to fully understand the sentences I have explained in the videos and do not hesitate to ask me about the points you do not understand. I will answer your questions with <strong>additional videos</strong>. I recommend that you work by typing the characters at the beginning. In this way, you will be able to grasp the structure of the characters much faster.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Still confused about Spanish grammar—even after taking a beginner course? You’re not alone!</strong></p><p>Hi, I’m Paulina! I’ve lived in Mexico and created this course for learners like you—people who’ve already started learning Spanish but still have questions about the grammar. Even native speakers sometimes struggle with grammar rules, so you’re not alone!</p><p>This course breaks things down in a simple, clear, and supportive way. I created each lesson with you in mind, so you can finally get the answers you've been looking for and build real confidence in your Spanish.</p><p>Spanish grammar is consistent across countries, but some things can vary depending on where you are. For example, verb conjugation and the use of <strong>tú</strong> and <strong>usted</strong>—both meaning “you”—can differ in formality and frequency across Spanish-speaking regions. This course offers context from Mexican Spanish to help you understand when and how these forms are typically applied, so you can communicate confidently and appropriately.</p><p>Whether you learned Spanish at school, through an app, or in a different country—this course will help solidify your grammar foundation. You’ll explore essential grammar concepts such as subject pronouns, the difference between <strong>ser</strong> and <strong>estar</strong>, and how possessive pronouns and adjectives work. We’ll also cover important details like the distinction between indefinite articles and numeral adjectives, pluralization rules, capitalization, and how accent marks can change a word’s meaning.</p><p>Let’s take the mystery out of Spanish grammar. Let’s do this!</p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>The course - titled \"Successful Responses to Listening Exam Pitfalls\" (SRLEP)- is of a great benefit for students who want to boost their test scores in the IGCSE / IELTS listening exams. This course is unlike other listening courses students may have attended. This is because listening courses tell students to underline the key words and focus on the meanings reflected in other words like synonyms because the speakers rarely say the correct responses in a direct way. This is good, but what if learners didn't understand these words due to the fast speech and the rapidly changing ideas and attitudes in the speakers' talks and conversations?</p><p>For this reason, this course doesn't only focus on the meanings reflected in the synonyms or equivalents used by the speakers, but it also allows learners to identify the speakers' speech patterns that involve the correct answers as well as the speech patterns that involve the wrong responses to find out the strategies, categories, features and rules governing these patterns. You will be exposed to six strategies governing the speech patterns that involve the correct responses in addition to seven techniques governing the speech patterns that involve the pitfalls.</p><p>The introduction covers six strategies covering speech patterns relevant to accurate responses in listening exams. It outlines both the features of incorrect answers and highlighting pitfalls before delving into correct responses. Real conversation excerpts from past paper audio files demonstrate these pitfalls naturally. Following this, a thorough explanation of these pitfalls—including speech markers and associated rules—will be provided.</p><p>After you've identified all the pitfalls in the introduction, you will be introduced to the chapters 1-6. Each chapter will introduce a strategy involving the correct answers, its features and the speech markers associated with it.</p><p>Similarly, you will listen to excerpts from real recorded conversations taken from the audio files of past papers. Then you will be given a detailed description of the strategy such as the speech markers and the rules that characterize the correct response, in addition to an explanation on the features and markers of the pitfalls or distracting information.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Aloha kākou!</p><p>If you are one of those people who learn the best through music, this is the perfect course for you. </p><p>Research has found that those who are engaged in language learning are also generally musical people. I have personal experience in this field. </p><p><br></p><p>My personal experience:</p><p>I was learning Spanish in school, I had been learning it for a few years and had difficulties remembering new words and phrases. However, one day our teacher handed us a paper with the lyrics of a Spanish song. We translated it all together and then listened to the song, and I realised I remembered most of it. </p><p>After this, I started to learn all languages of interest this way. </p><p>Therefore, I feel confident telling you that this is a very useful and helpful way to learn the Hawaiian language as well. </p><p><br></p><p>In this course we will cover several Hawaiian songs by different singers.</p><p>Examples of songs:</p><ul><li><p>E O Mai</p></li><li><p>Nani Ke Aloha</p></li><li><p>Ka Lei Mo'i</p></li><li><p>Pua Hinano</p></li><li><p>No Luna I Ka Halekai No ka Ma'alewa</p></li><li><p>Ka Lehua I Milia</p></li></ul><p>I truly hope you will enjoy this course, as it also takes you on a journey to experience the Hawaiian music. </p><p>Let's all take the time to start this journey and learn a new wonderful language together!</p>",

    "Basic English Proficiency: This course requires only a basic understanding of English, equivalent to CEFR A2 or higher, to follow instructions and participate in simple conversations. Whether you’re new to English or already comfortable with basic communication, the course starts with foundational lessons and progresses gradually to advanced techniques. The GenAI role-play system provides clear prompts and tailored feedback, making it easy for beginners to build confidence and for intermediate learners to refine their skills. This minimal language requirement ensures that anyone motivated to improve their speaking can dive in without feeling overwhelmed.",
    "Internet-Connected Device: To access the course’s online platform, you’ll need a computer, tablet, or smartphone with a stable internet connection. With over 45 hours of video lectures and interactive GenAI role-play sessions delivered online, this requirement ensures you can fully engage with the content. Most learners already own a suitable device, removing any significant barriers. The course’s cloud-based delivery means no complex software installations are needed, making it straightforward for beginners to get started with their IELTS Speaking preparation.",
    "Microphone and Speakers/Headphones: A device equipped with a microphone (built-in or external) and speakers or headphones is essential for participating in the GenAI-powered speaking practice sessions. These tools allow you to interact with AI avatars that simulate IELTS examiners, mimicking real test conditions. Since most modern devices come with built-in microphones and speakers, this requirement is easily met by beginners and advanced learners alike. The setup ensures you can practice speaking and receive audio feedback seamlessly, enhancing your fluency and pronunciation.",
    "PDF Reader for Course Materials: You’ll need a free PDF reader, such as Adobe Acrobat Reader, to access downloadable course materials, including 200 sample IELTS Speaking Tests with model answers. These resources enable offline practice and help you compare your responses with high-scoring examples. PDF readers are widely available at no cost, ensuring that even beginners can easily access and utilize these valuable materials. This requirement supports self-paced learning, allowing you to study whenever and wherever suits you best.",
    "Motivation to Practice Regularly: The only non-technical requirement is a willingness to engage with the course’s interactive role-plays and apply the GenAI feedback to improve. Consistent practice is crucial for mastering fluency, vocabulary, and pronunciation for the IELTS Speaking Test. The course’s self-paced format, lifetime access, and supportive AI system make it easy to stay motivated, even for beginners with no prior IELTS experience. This flexibility ensures that learners of all backgrounds can commit to their goals and achieve success in the IELTS Speaking Test or general English communication."

  "description": "<p>This course <strong>Irish Language Mastery - Not for the Faint-hearted</strong> is for those students who wish to <strong>get to grips with the Verbal Noun</strong>. In order to speak fluently and to have meaningful conversations in the Irish language students must be familiar with the verbal noun and the <strong>word order in purpose clauses</strong>. We explore the differences between <strong>transitive,&nbsp; intransitive and phrasal verbs.</strong> Rules regarding word order are explained thoroughly. <strong>Techniques </strong>are given to students which will help them to identify the correct verbal noun endings. </p><p>Now that students are familiar with the Copula in the Present Tense, the <strong>Past Tense Copula of Categorization</strong> is introduced. <strong>Clear and detailed explanations</strong> are a feature of this course. Students are encouraged to listen to lectures <strong>multiple times</strong> until they have mastered the grammatical concept in question. Laura also encourages students to re-do tests until they feel completely at ease with the new concerned.</p><p>The theme running through this Master Course is that of <strong>crime</strong>. As an avid true crime podcast listener, Laura seeks to share her <strong>specialist vocabulary</strong> with students so that they can discuss what they are watching and listening to. </p><p>This course is best undertaken <strong>following or in conjunction with the Advanced Class</strong>. The best of luck! Le dea-ghuí, Laura.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Kurzusomban először az angol igeidők szerkezetét, használatát mutatom be. A kurzust a jelen idők bemutatásával kezdem, majd a múlt és végül a jövő időket tanítom meg. Powerpoint segítségével prezentálom az egyes igeidők képzését, és&nbsp; a mondatban való elhelyezkedését. Kitérek az igeidők tagadó, kérdő szerkezetére is. Mindegyik igeidőnél beszélek a helyes használatról, ill. használatuk körülményeiről. Igyekszek rávilágítani a használatuk közötti különbségre, példamondatokkal illusztrálva azt.</p><p>Az igeidőket követően bemutatom azokat a nyelvtani szerkezeteket, amelyek az igeidőkre alapoznak. Tehát az igeidők ismerete nélkül nem tudod őket használni, megalkotni. Ezek pl. a szenvedő szerkezet, a függő beszéd, a feltételes mód.</p><p>Ezt követően szóbeli témák kidolgozását bemutató videókat nézhetsz meg. Ezekben a videókban összegyűjtöm az adott témához szükséges szókincset, kifejezéseket, nyelvtani szerkezeteket. Ezen kívül minden videó tartalmaz egy kidolgozott témát, amelyet segítségül felhasználhatsz a saját monológod kidolgozásához.</p><p>A megértés teszteléséhez minden oktató videó alatt gyakorló feladatokat osztok meg, amelyeken keresztül a diákok gyakorolhatják a tanultakat, majd le is ellenőrizhetik megoldásaikat. </p><p>Elsődleges célom, hogy segítséget nyújtsak a diákoknak mind a nyelvtan, mind a szókincs helyes használatában úgy a mindennapi életben, mint vizsgahelyzetben. </p><p>Várom visszajelzéseiteket, mi tetszett, mit javítsak, vagy mit csináljak másképp. Célom, hogy minél több érdeklődő diákot sikeressé tegyek az angol nyelv megértésében és használatában.</p><p>Jó tanulást, jó munkát kívánok mindenkinek!</p><p><br></p>",

This will further assist in the learners broader understanding of spoken English. </p><p>Also included are many <strong>pronunciation </strong>tips in order to help the student not only understand native British speakers but also sound like them. </p><p>Special emphasis here will be placed on English that is spoken in a natural fast way that so many students of English struggle with.

  "description": "<p>Learning Russian is really difficult, right? Wrong!</p><p>Just because it uses a script different from your own, it shouldn’t be seen as a huge obstacle.</p><p>My Russian Alphabet course makes learning Russian letters fun, easy, and convenient — whether at home or on the go, you’ll progress fast with this audiovisual course.</p><p>To design this course, I drew from my extensive experience as a Russian language tutor and translator. Fundamentally, we learn through repetition and connection. This course focuses more on <strong>making connections</strong> that will help you remember Russian letters more easily and quickly.</p><p>Some of the <strong>techniques</strong> I used were:<br></p><ul><li><p>Breaking down Russian letters into meaningful chunks</p></li><li><p>Drawing memorable illustrations</p></li><li><p>Storytelling</p></li><li><p>Audio pronunciation</p></li><li><p>Quizzes</p></li><li><p>Russian calligraphy practice worksheets</p></li></ul><p>Once you've completed the course, you can recognise all the letters of the Russian alphabet. You're now able to read and write Russian (including the Russian cursive). Most importantly, you're then ready to learn the language itself. Start with a beginner Russian course.</p><p><strong>This is what my students who completed the course say:</strong></p><p>\"As someone that had tried numerous resources to self-teach the Russian alphabet, I found it incredibly difficult to memorise. However, having completed this course, I genuinely do feel a noticeable improvement very quickly in my ability to read Russian text, which I feel will be strengthened with repetition and increased exposure to Russian Reading.</p><p>The course is fantastic, and would highly recommend it. The organiser of the course, Yana, is also absolutely fantastic as a tutor and would definitely recommend her to anyone wanting to learn this beautiful language.\" — Ravi, England.</p><p>\"I loved the Russian Alphabet course and thought it was very clear. I definitely found this approach very helpful and easier to digest. Great audio and fab style of illustrations definitely made me learn it faster. It took me 2 hours to complete the course, not long at all. I can now read Russian! I got 80% in the quiz, with only one word wrong in the last section - so I’m very happy! My next steps in learning Russian is having lessons with Yana to help me with my conversation, reading, and grammar (I’ve had a couple already, and they have been great!). I would definitely recommend the course to other students.\" — Amy, England.</p><p>\"I found the Russian Alphabet course very engaging. It's really straightforward and well-structured. In this course, the Russian alphabet is broken down into meaningful chunks. Students start with the easiest set of Russian letters and progress to more complex letters. This approach was well-thought-out, and I would definitely recommend this way of learning. The illustrations helped me memorise the letters faster. Whenever I see a Russian letter now, I immediately recall the English word it was used in to represent its sound. For example, the letter \"Ж\" in TreaЖure. It took me about 2 hours to complete the course. I can now read Russian, even if slowly. I would highly recommend this course to anybody. Even my boyfriend got hooked and sat next to me, learning the Russian letters with me. He too found it really engaging and fun. \" — Andrea, Hungary</p><p>Good luck!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Welcome to course 7 :-)</strong></p><p>Man sagt, dass die Sieben eine Glückszahl ist, und in Deutschland, gilt die Zahl 7 manchmal als “magische Zahl” oder als Heilig.</p><p><em>It is said that seven is a lucky number, and in Germany, the number 7 is sometimes considered a \"magic number\" or sacred.</em></p><p>Well, that might be going a bit far, but I do think course 7 is a wonderful addition to the 3 Minute German series, although I am obviously biased since I wrote it!</p><p>In this course, which contains lessons 54 to 62, we're going to be looking at lots of useful language features and further building our German vocabulary to enable us to speak in even more situations.</p><p><strong>What will I learn?</strong></p><p>To begin with, we'll be looking at more areas where German and English differ slightly, and why you can't always translate things word-for-word. The word \"<strong>woher</strong>\" for instance, is a new question word we can use when we want to say \"<strong>where ... from</strong>\" in English.</p><p>We're going to get quite a few new <strong>Vocabulary Expansion Sheets</strong> in this course, which will give us the opportunity to add more description to our language. We'll learn the words <strong>letze</strong> and <strong>nächste</strong>, as well as lots of new adverbs such as <strong>seit</strong>, <strong>bis</strong> and <strong>vor</strong>.</p><p>Course 7 comes with a new tense; we've looked at the present perfect tense in quite some detail now, so in this course we're going to move on and look at the <strong>present tense</strong>. As the name suggests, this tense will allow us to talk about what's happening in the present. We'll look at how to form the present tense for \"<strong>Sie</strong>\" using regular verbs and then we'll have a look at the group of irregular verbs who do their own things. We'll also look at another tense that is linked to the present tense: <strong>the imperative</strong>.</p><p>The imperative is the grammatical term for \"commands\", so you can use it to tell people what to do, or equally what not to do. This is quite a simple tense to learn once you've got to grips with the present tense.</p><p>So, that's a little bit about what you'll be learning in this seventh course, but of course there's lots more, including new verbs, new adjectives and adverbs, talking about the calendar in German and looking at some new structures as well as revamping some old structures.</p><p><strong>I hope you enjoy :-)</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>Hey, welcome to Vietnamese Pronunciation 101 – your passport to sounding like a local rockstar! We're not just teaching, we're throwing a language party, and you're invited.</p><p>First up, we're diving into the world of tones – the secret sauce that gives Vietnamese its rhythm. You'll be a tone master in no time! Then, we're cruising through single vowels like pros, adding an extra sprinkle of fun with double vowels, and turning it up to eleven with triple vowels. It's a vowel extravaganza! </p><p>But wait, there's more! We're getting cozy with consonants, doubling the consonant vibes for that extra flair. Plus, we're demystifying those sounds you've probably heard but weren't quite sure how to pronounce. Think of it as solving a cool linguistic puzzle! </p><p>Now, here's the fun part – after each lesson, we're not hitting the brakes; we're hitting the review button. We want to make sure those tones, vowels, and consonants are sticking in your memory. It's like a quick checkpoint to see how awesome you're becoming! </p><p>So, if you've ever tapped your foot to Vietnamese beats and thought, 'I want in on this,' you're in the right place. This course is your backstage pass to speaking Vietnamese like a local. Let's turn every word into a celebration – join the language fiesta!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>What you get</strong></p><p>Is your first accent of Arabic origin? This course is designed specifically to target your problem sounds. It’s one of the <em>ClearSpeak Time-Online Series</em> tailored for different accent groups.</p><ul><li><p>You get a complete package for both clear pronunciation and fluent neutral British English accent</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Your tutor is speech pathologist Alison ‘Kimi’ Kimble, an authority in English accent change</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Take the complete 15 Unit course <strong>OR</strong> study only a few problem sounds</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>You’ll find around 14 hours of demo videos and loads of audio exercises along with many support articles</p></li></ul><p>The ClearSpeak Method is a leader in the accent change field. It’s easy to get results with the professional speech pathology techniques.</p><p><strong>Your voice coach</strong></p><p>Hi</p><p>I’m Kimi Kimble, your professional tutor and voice coach for your speech journey.</p><p>If unclear speech is holding you back in your studies or career, then a <em>Time-Online</em> course is definitely for you. Our courses are for ‘committed’ students who may have tried other approaches and found they don’t produce a true or lasting result. There are no quick fixes!</p><p><strong>Pronunciation and accent change are a skill</strong></p><p>Like learning to play the piano, you cannot hope to master these by watching a series of short video clips. It takes much more to be able to <em>think</em> and <em>pronounce</em> fluently at the same time.</p><p><strong>The professional ClearSpeak Method</strong></p><p><em>Time-Online</em> courses are based on the ClearSpeak Method developed over 25 years. Used in many universities internationally, professional speech therapy techniques set this course apart from others. It will give you your best shot at achieving a superior result.</p><p><strong>Use fun techniques to learn</strong></p><p>I’ll be guiding you every step of the way through many hours of masterclass videos and ‘listen-and-repeat’ exercises. You’ll be using lots of intuitive visualisations along with instructions about how to move your mouth into the correct position. Simply ‘telling’ you what to do, and asking you to mimic me, are never enough.</p><p><strong>Accent change is not just about learning separate sounds</strong></p><p>Whole accent change has three quite different aspects and all are essential:</p><ul><li><p><strong>FIRST</strong> you learn to make each new sound, one at a time. </p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>SECOND</strong> you change the overall holding posture of your mouth as you speak. All your sounds are placed within this posture.</p><p>This method is used by professional mimics to create a <em>consistent</em> and <em>fluent </em>accent. There is no other way. Your mouth must ‘feel’ it is operating quite differently when you change from one accent to another. Most pronunciation courses make no mention of this critical step.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>THIRD</strong> you tune in to the speech melody of the English speech flow. </p><p>This is quite different to learning about intonation and stress within individual sentences. The Time-Online texts encourage you to mimic the <em>overall rhythmic melody</em>, regardless of the words or sentences used in your speech flow.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p>So, take a look at the outline that follows to learn more. I’ll be delighted to have your company if you decide to join me.</p><p>All the best for now!</p><p>Your tutor,</p><p>Kimi</p><p><br></p><p>“The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step”. LAO TZU</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How a course works</strong></p><p>The course is by self-study online. </p><p>In the <em>Start Up</em> <em>Unit </em>you will:</p><p>Discover all about English sounds and the ClearSpeak techniques</p><p>Decide on your course Plan</p><ul><li><p>The <em>Typical List of Errors</em> for your accent group has the 15 most common consonant and vowel errors relative to English</p></li><li><p>Study the entire List if your aim is overall accent change&nbsp; <strong>OR&nbsp; </strong>Select only a few problem sounds</p></li></ul><p> Then move on to study each sound on your Plan. There is a <em>Sound Kit Unit</em> of study materials for each one.</p><p><strong>All 15 Sound Kits have</strong></p><ul><li><p>A <strong>one-hour Masterclass video </strong>or a <strong>Tutorial video. </strong>Kimi demonstrates how real students achieve success with the ClearSpeak techniques.</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Sound Guide</strong> giving you instructions on how to make the sound</p></li><li><p><strong>Articles on key issues</strong> or challenges in making the sound</p></li><li><p>Up to<strong> one hour </strong>of custom-designed<strong> ‘listen and repeat’ audio exercises </strong>supported by text with words, phrases, sentences and story text</p></li><li><p>A set of <strong>Advanced Exercises for problem issues</strong>, such as confusion between similar sounds</p></li><li><p>A<strong> Review Text</strong> for evaluating your progress as you learn</p></li><li><p>A <strong>completion token </strong>for each<strong> </strong><em>Sound Kit Unit</em></p></li></ul>",

No captions/ subtitles needed! Just three minutes per preposition and you learn to use them. </p><p>You learn phrases - <em>not complex theory</em>. Learning phrases mean that you can start talking immediately. When you know the phrases by heart, you don't have to think when you talk. Just like you do not have think grammar when you talk your native language.</p><p>What a great way to spend the minutes you have on a bus, coffee break or when waiting a friend to arrive.</p><p>Your mind, muscles and ears learn the phrases by seeing, hearing and repeating. This is how a baby learns a language and so can you. Remember to start talking immediately. Speaking is the best (and only) way to learn. It´s not important if you say something wrong. Also babies talk a bit funny when they are learning. They learn along the way when they use the language.</p><p>Some preposition take the dative case, some the accusative. And some take either one depending what you are saying. When there is movement involved (where to), you use the accusative case. When the is no movement (where), you use the dative case.</p><p>For all levels. No grammar needed. Just see, hear and repeat. </p>",

  "description": "<p>Is English not your first language? Are people constantly asking you to repeat yourself? Do you want to advance in your career or business, but you feel like your foreign accent is holding you back?</p><p>Then this course is for you.</p><p>Hi. We hope you choose the complete guide to American English pronunciation. In it, I’ll take you through all 38 important sounds of American English, one at a time, to help you better pronounce each one. Each sound is produced for you to mimic, alone and in sample words, and illustrated with an animated mouth diagram where applicable. Then learn American English spelling rules for each sound. Also learn the International Phonetic Alphabet symbol for each sound. </p><p>Then, you further practice the sound next to other similar sounds. For this we use minimal pairs--These are pairs of words that have one sound distinct in them, for example: pin / fin, tanks / thanks, bad / bat. In these lessons, we’ll focus on how to make each word in the pair sound distinct and correct. Each lesson ends in a test to make sure that you can hear the difference between each pair of words. All this to help you to learn to pronounce American English more like a native speaker. Give it a go…</p>",

We focus on practical language you will actually use, making it simple, clear, and engaging for complete beginners.</p><p>You will be introduced to everyday situations where Darija is most needed: taking a taxi, ordering at a café or restaurant, shopping at the market, greeting people, and asking for basic information.

We pay special attention to numbers and money-related phrases to help you handle prices, bargaining, and payments with ease—because numbers are essential in daily interactions.</p><p>Beyond phrases, you’ll learn the most common expressions and vocabulary used across Morocco, including greetings, polite forms, time and days, directions, and simple small talk. Pronunciation tips and cultural notes are included to help you sound natural and understand local habits. Short quizzes reinforce each lesson, and downloadable cheat-sheets make revision quick and effective.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be able to introduce yourself, handle basic transactions, ask simple questions, and navigate common scenarios confidently in Darija. If you are a beginner, this course is for you. If you have any questions at any time, I will be happy to help and answer them. Join now and start your Darija journey today!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Are you tired of only learning textbook Japanese? This beginner-level course teaches you how to speak casual, everyday Japanese — just like native speakers do with friends and family.</p><p>This course includes:</p><p>* Full romaji support — so you can follow along even if you’re not confident reading hiragana yet.</p><p>* Easy-to-follow lessons on informal speech patterns and conjugation rules.</p><p>* Practice sessions to help you master casual verb and adjective forms.</p><p>* A collection of useful phrases, chunks, and fillers that are often not taught in traditional Japanese classes.</p><p>Why Learn Informal Japanese?</p><p>In Japanese, there are two main modes of speaking:</p><p>* Formal (polite) Japanese</p><p>* Informal (casual or colloquial) Japanese</p><p>It’s just like in English — you don’t speak the same way to your boss as you do with your close friends, right?</p><p>Native Japanese speakers constantly switch between levels of politeness based on the situation. If a Japanese person can’t do this, they might be seen as rude or uneducated. However, most Japanese language courses only teach the formal style, which can leave you confused when listening to native conversations — whether on the streets of Tokyo or in anime.</p><p>That’s where this course comes in.</p><p>What You’ll Learn</p><p>* The differences between formal and informal Japanese</p><p>* How to conjugate verbs and adjectives casually</p><p>* When and how to drop particles or shorten phrases naturally</p><p>* Common fillers, slang, and casual expressions</p><p>* How to understand and respond in real-life conversations</p><p>Is This Course Right for You?</p><p>* You’re a beginner or low-intermediate learner. You want to sound more natural and connect with native speakers. You’re interested in anime, travel, or real Japanese culture. You feel “lost” when listening to native conversations. You want to understand the grammar — not just memorize phrases.</p><p>Even if you don’t love studying grammar, I’ll make it easy to understand and apply. You’ll start to notice clear patterns between casual and formal speech, and soon you’ll be able to speak and understand informal Japanese naturally.</p><p>Let’s expand your Japanese skills beyond the textbook — and into the real world!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Have you ever felt self-conscious when speaking French - worrying that your R’s roll too harshly or your vowels sound off? Whether you're a beginner or an intermediate learner, these doubts can affect your confidence. Clear and accurate pronunciation is your gateway to being understood - and to understanding - French in real life conversations, exams, and travel. This course demystifies the sounds, rhythm, and intonation of spoken French with clear explanations and step-by-step practice. You’ll start with the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and the special features of French speech, then systematically master every consonant, vowel, and semi-vowel. We’ll tackle the toughest sounds - the uvular “R,” the subtle distinction between ou and u, the nasal vowels, and more, before moving on to rhythm, liaisons, silent letters, and even regional and formality differences. Each video includes guided practice and exercises, and you’ll finish with a personalized self-training plan to continue improving long after the course ends, helping you speak with greater clarity and natural flow.</p><p><br></p><p>After taking this course,<strong> you will be able to:</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Accurately produce and distinguish all French phonemes</p></li><li><p>Read French texts aloud using correct accents and IPA guidance</p></li><li><p>Apply liaisons and intonation patterns naturally in conversation</p></li><li><p>Recognize and adapt to different regional and formality-based pronunciations</p></li><li><p>Confidently record and assess your own spoken French for continuous improvement</p></li></ul>",

Existing research demonstrates that language learners grow more in their ability when they speak the additional language and practice consistently. In effect, studies have shown that reading, listening, and speaking of languages will all help build confidence over time. This course will introduce you to aspects of the French language you can practice in personal relationships, in future travel to Francophone countries, or in preparation for the DELF language certification. This exam is a reputable addition to your resume as a linguistic requirement for academic and work opportunities.</p><p><br></p><p>This course has roughly 1 hour and twelve minutes of video and is designed to be taken over a 7-day period to digest the process of improving your ability to speak, comprehend, and write in French. There will be exercises, homework, and real questions from the DELF Exam where you can practice the skills necessary to potentially pass and become competent in the French language. By the end of the course, you will also feel more confident about your communication skills and be excited about practicing on a consistent basis to perfect them moving forward.</p>",

Those are linked to <strong>ALL spoken forms of these verbs</strong> (abbreviated or lacking pronouns) for a better understanding during communication. Many Romanians, in usual conversations, don’t use the pure grammar forms of these verbs in the present tense, and there is an absolute need to know them to spot them in spoken language.</p><p>Besides the main topic, as a bonus, there are three vocabulary lessons (house-related, nationalities, and sentences/phrases used to establish a closer relation or – if needed – to break it) and the numerals from 1 to 12.</p><p>This course aims to deliver you the knowledge that will enable you to understand various forms of the verbs \"a fi\" and \"a avea,\" including those largely used in spoken language and rarely touched in official courses as they are not in line with the \"official\" / colloquial language. </p><p>To ensure a smooth progression, if you start from 0, please make sure you study before the previous (free of charge) course I prepared on phonetics.</p><p>Good luck!</p>",

  "description": "<p>Without doubt IELTS can be a tricky examination. Statistically, academic writing&nbsp; gets the lowest band score of all the skills internationally, with an <strong><em>average of 5.7 in 2019</em></strong>. So if you have been stuck at a band 6.0 then you are actually doing very well - you are above average!</p><p>A lot of students focus their efforts on the<strong><em> Task 2 Essay because it is worth 2/3 of the total score</em></strong>! While it's good to prepare as much as possible this is also a big mistake that students and some teachers, make when preparing for the exam. If you <em>fail to practise the Task 1 Report you could lose 1/3 of your total marks! </em>Hold that thought for a moment and ask yourself why would you give up, potentially 1/3 of your total writing score?</p><p>So, the purpose of this course is to remove some of the mystery around Task 1 academic writing and show you some simple techniques to help you approach this task with confidence and secure that 1/3 toward your Band 7.0 or 7.5+.</p><p>The course is divided into sections </p><ol><li><p>We begin with some background to the task, the examiners and ways of structuring your report. </p></li><li><p>Moving on, we explore each of the main data types and various techniques for approaching these. </p></li><li><p>We have included some examples from students work and in some cases examiner model answers and comments. </p></li><li><p>Sections 9 and 10, focus on some of the key areas of grammar and vocabulary that are necessary for this particular writing task.</p></li></ol><p>All of these sections are elaborated in <strong><em>3 downloadable Workbooks.</em></strong> You will find the data types, and some tasks to give you more practise. There are additional grammar exercises and links providing a list of resources to support your preparation.</p><p>I really look forward to supporting you on your journey to a Band 7.0+ in IELTS. Having taught IELTS&nbsp;now for more than 12 years in the Middle East, Asia and Europe, I am confident that you will gain a lot of confidence in preparing for this task, and will succeed in obtaining your desired goals.</p><p><br></p><p>See you in the course.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>This course is designed for the purpose of \"improving listening and reading comprehension<strong> for beginners\".&nbsp; </strong>Both this course and the course that was launched in May are for beginners. The May course is centered on commentary, and this course is centered on conversational sentences, so the overall structure has been recreated from scratch.</p><p><strong>\"Beginners Ⅱ\" is a course to learn conversational sentences on the theme of daily life in 12 days.</strong></p><p><strong>This is a 12-day conversation course for beginners with the aim of improving Japanese listening and reading comprehension</strong>.&nbsp; For example, you can listen to simple words used in daily life by using conversational sentences with themes such as eating, shopping, going to the hospital, going to a mobile phone shop, going to a real estate company, and getting on a train.&nbsp; <strong>You can also have a simple conversation with your friends in natural Japanese towards the end of this course.</strong></p><p>This course aims to improve your listening comprehension, so I will talk it slowly and twice so that your ears can \"get used to Japanese pronunciation\". Please concentrate on listening. If you listen to it once, you can hear about 50%, but if you listen to it twice, you can hear 70% to 80%. Guess the rest. The aim of this learning is to develop the ability to guess.</p><p><strong>I value reading aloud practice</strong>. Furigana is added to the kanji. This is because I want everyone to be able to read kanji. If you can read kanji, you can practice reading aloud. </p><p><strong>\"Reading aloud practice by slash reading\" </strong>is an effective learning method for those who have a problem that \"the sentences are too long and you cannot understand what they are saying in the middle.\"</p><p><strong>In other words, \"reading aloud practice method by slash reading\" is a method to prevent \"return reading\" and understand in Japanese word order.</strong></p><p><strong>This practice method has the effect of activating the brain because the brain performs complicated processes such as reading letters with the eyes, speaking with the mouth, and listening to the voice with the ears. Furthermore, this time, we will challenge \"high-speed reading aloud\".</strong></p><p><strong>You can learn natural Japanese without being bound by esoteric grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.</strong></p><p><strong>For example, on the first day, while listening to the conversational sentence with the theme of \"meal\", \"confirm the sentence pattern\", \"listen to the conversational sentence (listen twice)\", \"explain the conversation content\", \"confirm the conversation content\". (practice questions) ”and“ Improving listening comprehension by slash reading (reading practice) ”will be studied in this order.</strong></p><p>By repeating this for 12 days with different themes, you will be able to hear conversations in your daily life and have simple conversations with your friends. You are not just listening. By reading the letters with your eyes, listening to the conversation with your ears, and practicing reading aloud with your mouth, you can concentrate on learning in a short time.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Zen, or Chan Buddhism is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang Dynasty as Chan Buddhism. Zen school was strongly influenced by Taoism and developed as a distinguished school of Chinese Chan Buddhism. From China, Chan Buddhism spread south to Vietnam, northeast to Korea and east to Japan, where it became known as Japanese Zen. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>The term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle word 禪 (Chan), which traces its roots to the Indian practice of \"meditation. Zen emphasizes rigorous self-control, meditation-practice, Insight into Buddha nature, and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, As such, it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of Sutras and doctrine<sup> </sup>and favors direct understanding and interaction with an accomplished teacher.<sup> </sup>  As they expressed in the Zen phrase, “teach beyond scripture, transmit without words, point directly to human heart, attain instantly to Buddha nature.” “your fingers are the words, the truth is like the moon, the finger can point to the moon, but is not the moon.” It emphasizes the identity of being and vacuity, moment and eternity: “Life is between breathing”. “Ten thousand years’ void, one morning’s wind and moon.” It venerate insight into Buddha nature more than ritualistic worship of a Buddha figure, as they expressed, “Outside mind, no Buddha”, “killing the Buddha, killing the patriarch,” “becoming Buddha and demon is only moment of thought.” It talks about annihilating desires to achieve an immobility of heart among the fluctuation of all things: as Six Patriarch expresses it, “Neither the flag nor the wind is moving, human heart is moving”, “ The wind passes the bamboo  forest, the bamboo retains no sound after it passes; the wild geese flying over the cold lake, the lake does not retain the forms of the geese.” Like the Taoist philosopher Zhuang Zi It advocates getting rid of the mentality of making distinction, including the distinction between the self and other, to enter instantly and directly into a situation and react to it most effectively, for example, the wrestler images himself a huge wave becomes an all-sweeping, all-swallowing, invincible fighter. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Zen’s major practice includes observing the breath, observing the mind, Zen Koan, Buddhist chanting etc.  Zen koan is an enigmatic, logic-defying method of prompting the disciples to achieve instant enlightenment. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It was during the late 1950s and the early 1960s that the number of Westerners other than the descendants of Asian immigrants who were pursuing a serious interest in Zen began to reach a significant level. Japanese Zen has gained the greatest popularity in the West. The various books on Zen by people such as Alan Watts and D. T. Suzuki published between 1950 and 1975, contributed to this growing interest in Zen in the West, as did the interest on the part of beat poets such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and Gary Snyder.  In 1958, the literary magazine Chicago Review played a significant role in introducing Zen to the American literary community, especially beat poets.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course includes 20 Zen Buddhist Stories, each story is taught in two lectures, mostly Zen Koan in an intensely interesting, enigmatic,  iconoclastic, and humorous style used by Zen masters to prompt instant enlightenment in their disciples,   the first lectures teaches the language of the Zen story, I will lead you to study the vocabulary list, the text of the story and lead you to recite them, and practice answering questions about the text. The second lecture is a recitation of the story, so that you can practice listening comprehension and be further familiar with the language and content of the stories. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You don't need prerequisite for this course, it has detailed vocabulary list from the beginning to advanced level, however, it is advisable to take my College Mandarin Chinese on Your Own Beginning Level. This course will teach you a wide range of vocabulary from beginning to advanced level, and acquaint you with the core values of Zen Buddhism, and its unique means of enlightenment. Through this course you will find your Chinese language level soar together with your spiritual delight and thrill with the most iconoclastic and hilarious way of acquiring sudden, deep religious wisdom that has profoundly influenced both the East and the West, particularly American Beat Poets . \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> \n\n  </p>",

  "description": "<p>Each lesson is set up to help you advance with confidence. These programs use your past knowledge, add to it and move you forward into the future. The English language is a tool to take advantage of opportunities and we all need to make our English better. These lessons will help you to retain what you have worked so hard to learn and build upon that foundation. Your inventory of words will grow and exercises to reinforce their usage will help you communicate with others in a confident way. Growing up in the United States, I was always interested in communicating with others and looking to expand my contacts. Specifically paying attention to History and English, I knew that knowledge opened doors and the world was full of opportunities in many areas and for many people. Access to areas like social media, travel, education and careers has broadened the importance of preparation and opportunity. As a foreigner living in Brazil, I have seen how important communication is and have felt welcomed here. In 2010, the door opened for me to begin teaching English classes to friends and neighbors. I have developed my material and my presentation over the years and would now like to share it with you.</p>",

  "description": "<p>You probably learned the ASL alphabet WRONG!</p><p>Well, it’s not your fault and I’m here to make it right.</p><p>Most people learn the ASL alphabet as they did the English Alphabet. BUT… ASL is a different language and should be learned as such.</p><p>In part 1 we learned the right way to fingerspell starting with fist shape letters. These are the toughest to recognize and they are the most common. Fist shapes contain 4 of the 5 vowels, therefore, we start with these as they are essential. </p><p>In part 2 we learned the UP shapes. With fist shapes and up shapes, you can spell most words. These are very easy to identify because they stick straight up and have unique handshapes. </p><p>In part 3 we learned down and horizontal shapes. Similar to up letters, down and horizontal letters have a unique handshapes and are easy to identify. With only 2 letters left, your fingerspelling skills should be taking off!</p><p>In part 4 we learned the final 2 letters… the moving letters. Learning how to produce moving letters is the challenge here but once you get it, you got it! </p><p>This completes the entire alphabet. If you learned this step by step, not only do you know the entire alphabet but you are starting to develop real fingerspelling skills not just A, B, C, D…</p><p>In part 5… what else is there to learn? DOUBLE LETTERS!</p><p>We take it step by step to really learn to identify and perform each letter correctly before learning more letters.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Admit it - your eyes glaze over when you find out you need to learn <strong><em>one more use</em></strong> of the Latin ablative case. You've already learned . . . oh, who knows . . . twelve, fifteen . . . how many uses of the ablative are there, anyway?</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The Ablative Blues</em></strong></p><p>Never fear, there's a solution to the Ablative Blues. That's the goal of this course. Our aim is not just to give you the tools to distinguish different uses of the ablative case with confidence, but to help you use that knowledge to gain a deeper appreciation of Latin literary texts. A deeper appreciation, in turn, enables you to derive greater enjoyment from the work of Latin authors.</p><p><br></p><p>I hardly need to tell you that it’s hard to understand the Latin language without a mastery of the ablative case. Unlike modern English, Latin uses case endings on nouns to express what that noun is doing in a given sentence. Latin has five main cases with two other minor cases. More than one noun in every four, however, is in the ablative case. Not only that, there are more than twenty different uses of the ablative, some of them signifying very different things. Sometimes there’s a preposition to help narrow down what that ablative ending is trying to tell us . . . but sometimes not.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>What This Course Does</em></strong></p><p>That’s where this course comes in. You'll start by separating the uses of the ablative into three different “relationships.” These derive from three separate cases from an earlier stage of the Latin language (yes, there used to be <strong><em>even more</em></strong> cases). By tracing back the individual uses to these earlier cases, you'll see more clearly how and why the different uses mean what they do. You will also look at which prepositions go with which of the three relationships. Finally, you'll learn when to use the prepositions, and when the ablative noun stands alone.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the course you’ll have a much firmer grasp on the various uses of the ablative. More importantly, you’ll find that all the various prepositions and other details open up nuances and deeper meanings that you didn’t see before. As a result, you’ll not only have greater competence and confidence in your translation skills, you’ll derive more enjoyment from reading the work of Latin authors.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Who Am I?</em></strong></p><p>This is my first Udemy course, but I have a lot of experience teaching Latin. I’ve taught in traditional schools, both public and private, for almost four decades. I was also an instructor in an online school for many years. I’ve drawn on all that experience, and even more years of study, in putting together this class.</p><p><br></p><p>I’m also available to answer any questions you have about Latin and related topics, even after you’ve completed this course. And of course, you will have permanent access to the course and all its content.</p><p><br></p><p>In the event (unlikely, I hope) that you’re dissatisfied with the class, Udemy offers a 30 day money back guarantee.</p><p><br></p><p>So, <strong><em>Age</em></strong>, go ahead! Add “Mastering the Ablative Case in Latin: 20 Uses Made Easy” to your cart today. <strong><em>Laetificaberis </em></strong>- you’ll be glad you did!</p><p><br></p><p><em>Landing page image: photo by Frank_P_AJJ74 via Pixabay</em></p>",

  "description": "<p>Bonjour et bienvenue (hello and welcome) to French Grammar – Quick Guide – Verbs 3. This course is designed to get you familiar with French grammar in quick, easy-to-understand lessons.</p><p>In any language, verbs are the backbone to sentences. Without verbs there would be no sentences. The good thing about verbs is that you can manipulate them and use them to express anything you like. Look at these sentences, for example:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Learn French</strong></p><p><strong>They want me to learn French</strong></p><p><strong>I would like to learn French</strong></p><p><strong>I couldn’t learn French</strong></p><p><br></p><p>All these sentences contain pretty much the same words, “I”, “learn” and “French”, but they mean different things because we’ve manipulated the verb “learn” into different tenses. In “Verbs 1”, we learnt all about infinitives, the “going” future tense, the present perfect tense and the present tense. In Verbs 2, we learnt all about the future tense, the imperfect tense and the conditional. In Verbs 3, we’re going to be looking at imperatives, the subjunctive and infinitive carriers. To help you to become familiar with the verb tenses, you’ll find lots of exercises to enable you to build proficiency in French grammar.</p><p>With each tense, we’ll be looking at how to form it, how to turn it negative, and we’ll also be looking at the various ways you can translate the different tenses into English. The Quick Guide courses are great for learning the specifics of French grammar, without any prerequisites. I won’t be using any vocabulary without introducing it first, meaning you can focus purely on grammar acquisition rather than worrying about not understanding the verbs. However, we will be using vocabulary learnt in Verbs 1 and 2, so I recommend you read those books before starting this one. I’ll give you a list of verbs at the start of the course, and we’ll be using these throughout – they are the same verbs we looked at in Verbs 1 and 2. These Quick Guide courses can also be used as reference guides to use as a revision should you ever need to brush up on your French grammar.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Set course to… perfecting your passive English skills</strong></p><p>The 21st century world speaks English. It is the go-to language during political, scientific and business meetings, as well as that of students going abroad for internships. You also refer to it on a daily basis, both in professional settings and in your spare time, like when you watch a movie on a popular streaming service or translate the lyrics of your favorite song for your own pleasure. Or… when a foreigner in the street asks you for directions to the nearest pharmacy!</p><p>Usually, when you learn or work on a language, you focus on active skills (speaking) and forget that passive skills (reading and listening) are just as important. After all, a conversation is not a monologue, but rather two or more people taking turns to speak and listen. That’s why in this course, the most important topics are approached in the forms of dialogues and short texts which you listen to without seeing the transcript, just as you would in the real world. Activities during the classes will help you to hone the skills you need to understand spoken texts, and useful expressions listed in the additional materials will serve as a quick guide.</p><p>The course has three levels, so that you can go from easier tasks to harder ones as you progress.</p><p><strong>What you can expect from our professional training</strong></p><p><strong>During the course:</strong></p><p>• You will gain the skill of seeking the information you need in dialogues and in a flowing text<br>• You will familiarize yourself with different accents while listening<br>• You will gain the capability to listen and understand without reading the text at the same time</p><p>Moreover…</p><p>• You’ll revise expressions that you know and learn new ones ready to be used in practice</p><p>English Master: listening. From zero to hero is designed for learners at all levels of English. To make full use of the course, you need to know English at least on the A1 level (know basic grammatical tenses, such as Present Simple, Past Simple, Present Continuous, Future Simple and basic vocabulary relating to everyday life). Basic-level English speakers will benefit most from working with easier texts, while more advanced users can expect texts filled with more difficult vocabulary, fast speech and background noise, which reflect the real-life situations in which you are supposed to make use of your skills.</p><p><strong>Excuse me, could you repeat?</strong></p><p>Learning a foreign language is a never-ending journey. It’s not about signing up to a course and cramming new vocabulary into your head or doing hundreds of grammar exercises, after all. You need to challenge yourself in practice so that your skills don’t become rusty. It’s worth reaching deeper and listening in on informal speech, sayings, abbreviations and phrases: things that are obvious to a native speaker, but completely new for you. This ability to use idiomatic, „real” English will help you soar onto a higher level in your conversations. That’s why the course focuses on everyday topics, such as meeting new people, negotiations, networking, communication at the airport, in a shop or at a hotel, as well as job interviews and listening to radio and TV news.</p><p><strong>Meet our expert</strong></p><p>Anna Lewoc, graduate of the Institute of Applied Linguistics at the University of Warsaw, works as a translator and interpreter of English and French into Polish, as well as a teacher of English. She’s also the organizer of one of the largest conferences for the translation and localization industry in this part of Europe: The Translation and Localization Conference. It doesn’t exhaust the long list of projects she takes up. In her free time, she does sports (weightlifting, running, yoga), cooks, watches TV series or plays video games (mostly RPG). She’s passionate about psychology and self-management.</p><p><strong>Get your listening to a new level!</strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>The course is divided into three parts: a first part consisting of 25 lessons with as many dialogues on topics of travel and everyday life. Each dialogue is preceded by a picture of a characteristic place in France with a two-line description, the description will be expanded in the pdf of the lesson. These dialogues are supplemented by explanations, again in French, of a lexical or grammatical nature. In addition to the dialogue part, each lesson has a part A of video exercises entitled \"vrai ou faux\" or \"choisissez\", to check your understanding, and a part B with repetition and memorisation exercises. There are also written exercises on pdf.</p><p><br></p><p>The second part, which is closely linked to the first, is entitled \"800 mots français\", where you will learn and use 800 words of the French language in both oral and written form, divided into 20 topics: at the hotel, in the restaurant, meat or fish, legumes and vegetables, fruit, food, our body part 1, our body part 2, visiting Paris and France, the hairdresser/barber, the chemist, means of transport, around the city, travelling, shopping, the doctor, the bar, at home, clothing, accessories. This second part comes with 10 multiple choice tests to check your learning; one test every two lessons on 10 words from the previous lessons but placed in a different context.</p><p><br></p><p>\"800 mots français\" is not a lexicon with the French word on one side and the English word on the other.

  "description": "<p>The big Romanian course on Pronoun is here covering all you need from basic and intermediate levels, even advanced to a good extent. In 19 lessons, including almost 5 hours of video teaching material and more than 200 questions, you will acquire the necessary grammar knowledge related to using the pronoun in the Romanian language. This course is a complex course with a holistic approach asking for good English grammar knowledge. It is strongly advised to follow the previous courses and master a minimal vocabulary before getting here. Do not step in this course if you start from 0 or without having a minimum background in the Romanian language. Focus is on:</p><ul><li><p>Personal pronoun</p></li><li><p>Politeness pronoun</p></li><li><p>Possessive pronouns</p></li><li><p>Reflexive pronoun</p></li><li><p>Remoteness and proximity pronoun (e.g., this / that)</p></li><li><p>Interrogative pronoun (e.g., who / what)</p></li><li><p>Reinforcing the pronoun in spoken language</p></li></ul><p>The grammar of the Romanian Pronoun is a complex one with ramifications in many other areas and with a strong set of Grammar rules. The course tries to cluster these rules based on the most used pronouns and facilitate the learning using extensive explanations and exercises.</p><p>Those really willing to correctly speak Romanian need to master these rules. The course comes with quizzes and practice tests cumulating over 200 teachers' validated questions concerning the subject. Questions are linked to the topics. PDF Documentation is attached and can be downloaded at the end of the last Section.</p><p>In order to avoid false expectations, please be aware that this course has no basic vocabulary or conversations that you may listen to and repeat. However, you can easily find basic conversations movies on YouTube. What I teach is the Romanian language for those interested in understanding the grammar to bring their language skills to a higher level so they can speak like a native Romanian.</p><p>To ensure a smooth progression, if you start from 0, please make sure you study at least the (free of charge) course on phonetics.</p><p>Good luck!</p>",

Cantonese&nbsp; Tones</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Basic Description of <strong>Cantonese Consonants</strong></p><p>Cantonese has 20 consonant sounds: p, b, t, d, ts, dz, k, g, kw, gw, f, h, l, m, n, ng, s, y and w. The first 10 come in pairs. (Unlike English, ts and dz occur at the beginning of words in Cantonese.) The consonants in the first column (p, t, ts, k and kw) are pronounced with a heavy puff of air, called aspiration.</p><p><br></p><p>Basic Description of <strong>Cantonese Finals</strong></p><p><strong>Cantonese has the final \"aa\" but doesn't have the final \"a\"</strong>. Therefore in the Yale system, final \"aa\" will be written as \"a\". But the sound is still \"aa\". For example, if you see \"fa\", the pronunciation should be actually \"faa\".</p><p><br></p><p>Basic Description of <strong>Cantonese&nbsp; Tones</strong></p><p><strong><em>Cantonese</em></strong> uses <strong><em>tone</em></strong> contours to distinguish words, with the number of possible <strong><em>tones</em></strong> depending on the type of final.</p><p><br></p><p>They are basic elements for absolute beginners.

In fact, English regular verbs generally do not pose much of a problem to learners as long as they know the basic rules about how they function and how to form past simple and past participle forms.</p><p>Irregular verbs forms, however, must be learnt by heart, as they have their own rules. </p><p>The 300 English irregular verbs discussed in this course are divided into three groups. The first contains those irregular verbs where the infinitive form, the past simple form and the past participle form are different, as well as those irregular verbs where the past tense form or the past participle form is the same as the infinitive. The second group contains irregular verbs where the past simple and the past participle forms are the same, and the third group contains irregular verbs where the infinitive, past simple and past participle forms are identical in spelling, though in a few cases they do differ in pronunciation.</p><p>The use of each irregular verb and its forms is illustrated by several example sentences, making it much easier to remember the forms in context.</p><p>The topic on irregular verbs presented in the course will help to enrich and expand both the practical and correct use of them. </p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>During my years as a Spanish language educator, I developed an acute radar for recognizing which of my students had the best or worse chances to succeed.&nbsp; One particular truism became very clear: any learners who do not begin by assimilating the basics of Spanish pronunciation <em>first</em>, sabotage their progress throughout their entire language learning experience.</p><p>When students learn to pronounce accurately, they also learn to read in Spanish, to write in Spanish, and to interpret meaning, as well.&nbsp; Without merging sounds with their corresponding letters and ultimately whole words, learners will never be able to understand spoken Spanish.&nbsp; Without accuracy in replicating sounds and ultimately whole words, learners who attempt to speak Spanish will never be understood by native speakers.</p><p>So Rule One is to learn proper pronunciation.&nbsp; Frankly, students who miss this basic first step may well be wasting their time.</p><p>The good news is that this first step is super easy to achieve.&nbsp; It's possible to learn the basics in one sitting!&nbsp; Then just practice, practice, practice.</p><p>That's why we created the Spanish Pronunciation Boot Camp.&nbsp; It's for those who want to succeed and not waste their time.</p><p>The Boot Camp Modules cover everything you need to know about pronunciation, spelling, written accents, and more!&nbsp; They are divided into small bite-sized chunks, with enough redundancy for organic review.&nbsp; Move through them at your own pace.&nbsp; Review any Modules at any point.&nbsp; There's a final test at the Conclusion for you to measure your progress.</p>",

  "description": "<p>About our course: <br>The purpose of the preparation of this course is to eliminate the shortage of resources in Swedish and to have the participants listen to the Swedish words and sentences exactly from the voice of the Swedish instructor. One of the other objectives of the course is to show and listen to the sentences established according to the Subjek-Verb-Objekt rule, which is the immutable rule of Swedish in making sentences (SVO). <br><br>Course content was created with words and sentences containing many different professional groups. Particular attention has been paid to the words and sentences chosen to be words and sentences used in daily life. Prepared committee and audio sentences were prepared in the form of bilateral dialogue or question-answer type and presented to course participants. </p><p>While choosing the occupational groups in the course, the content of the course was prepared by taking into account many businesses serving in the tourism sector, as well as health institutions, patient households, marketers, students and many other professional groups. In this course, we also tried to give the information they may need to different topics within the course as much as possible, considering the students who have recently immigrated to Sweden, students who continue their university education in Sweden, or people who have just started to learn Swedish. Participants of the course will be able to find the words given in each unit in alphabetical order. Since the same words have synonym words, they will be able to find the same words written twice in some units, or they will be able to see and hear words that have multiple meanings more than once in the same unit or in a different unit. Additions will be made to the current topics of our course in the future. No extra fee will be charged for the additions to be made.</p>",

You will learn hundreds of words and expressions that will prepare you for your stay in France. <br><br>We divided the course in 16 sessions - each one of them carefully chosen, to cover majority of the most important aspects of life in France. You will learn how to order in a restaurant, rent a car, shop for clothes and shoes, rent a flat and many more.<br><br>The course is full of cultural knowledge - you won´t just learn vocabulary, you will learn about many aspects of life in France. <br><br>We did our best to make the course as progressive as possible. The first session is a warm-up and contains the easiest vocabulary. It gets more and more difficult with each video. The last session contains the most difficult vocabulary, so we encourage you to watch the videos from first to last. <br><br>We believe that you learn best when you learn in your target language. The audio is 100% in French, but there are subtitles in English. This is a great way to improve your listening skills. <br><br>Allez, on commence ?</p>",

  "description": "<p>In this course, you will learn step-by-step conversational skills in Persian. First, you will become familiar with vocabulary related to popular topics that you need to discuss. Then, you will be able to apply this vocabulary in simple and basic sentences. The slides are accompanied by pictures that help you learn easily. After each slide, there is a corresponding slide for self-assessment. My primary goal in this course is to enable you to converse in practical situations. Later, we will focus on recognizing the sounds in Persian, as there are some sounds that many languages do not have. This part of the lesson will help students pronounce and distinguish each sound correctly. Finally, you will become familiar with all consonants and vowels in writing and reading, one by one. Each letter is accompanied by slides designed to provide you with more examples. The grammar section is another component of the course, which will teach you very basic grammar in Persian. It will demonstrate the differences between English and Persian in all parts of sentences. At the end of each section, there are assessments in the resources to help you evaluate your understanding. In addition, there are links to related lessons to provide you with more opportunities to enhance your learning.</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>If you’re a beginner at learning Spanish or beginning to brush up on your Spanish skills, </strong>this course will teach you things about Spanish that will help make sense out of what you’re studying so you can learn more easily, and quicker! And the great thing is you don’t need any previous experience to take this course.</p><p><strong>WHAT WILL YOU LEARN?</strong></p><p>From my experience and training in Spanish, I’ve seen that the more someone understands why words change from one context to another, the more engaged the students are and the quicker they’re able to learn because they can understand the patterns that make up the language. That’s why I wanted to share what I’ve learned with you. I’ve picked some of the basic concepts in Spanish that help the most in acquisition and retention of a foreign language when you’re first learning.</p><p><strong>Some of the things you’ll learn in this course are:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Punctuation and how it cues you when reading</p></li><li><p>Cognates and how they can make learning Spanish easier</p></li><li><p>Diminutives and why they’re used</p></li><li><p>Pronunciation and how to sound more like a native speaker</p></li><li><p>Adjectives and how their placement is helpful</p></li><li><p>Number, which is singular and plural, and why it’s important</p></li><li><p>Gender, which is masculine and feminine, and what the subtleties tell you</p></li></ol><p><strong>If you want to go even further with learning how to sound more like a native speaker,</strong> you can download the activity titled, \"Practice With Phonetic Spellings in Spanish\" that's in lecture 5 on pronunciation. This activity, with the downloadable resource of the Pronunciation Guide that you can also find in that lecture, will help you pronounce Spanish with more confidence, while avoiding the most obvious pronunciation errors.</p><p><strong>IS THIS COURSE FOR YOU?</strong></p><p><strong>If you want to have a leg up on learning Spanish, yes! </strong>By the end of this course you should have a greater understanding of some critical and foundational aspects of the Spanish language that will make it easier to learn.</p><p><strong>LET'S GET STARTED!</strong></p><p>I&nbsp;hope to hear about what new concepts you've enjoyed learning about, and getting any questions or feedback you have!</p>",

  "description": "<p>The goal is get your toddler to talk! This course is designed by a speech pathologist, and it is for toddlers that have fewer than 15 words in their vocabulary. The toddler is encouraged to watch 35, three-minute videos, by themselves or together with their parent/caregiver (they can assist by imitating actions and the target word after the characters.) </p><p>These cartoons were used in therapy with toddlers that have limited vocabularies and after hundreds of success stories, these cartoons are now available for every child in need!</p><p>The course is subdivided into sections based on word categories (vehicles, animals, familiar toddler words, etc). The cartoons do not have to be watched in any particular order. The child can watch each cartoon as many times as they would like in order to master the new word. New words are learned when the child develops the association between the word and what it represents. A specific technique of having the word repeated many times during the cartoon is used in order to enhance the child's understanding of the word. The same family of characters is used throughout all of the 35 cartoons to promote the child's connection with the characters.</p><p>It is beneficial for the parent to imitate the actions after the cartoon characters and to sing the target word as it comes up on the screen. This will help elicit word productions from your child. However, the parent/caregiver does not need to be present in order for the child to learn!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>Welcome to <strong>\"Master Japanese with 800 Real-Life Dialogues\"</strong>, a comprehensive and immersive Japanese language course designed for learners of all levels. Whether you're a complete beginner or someone looking to deepen your conversational skills, this course offers a unique, engaging, and affordable way to become fluent in Japanese through 800 high-quality audio dialogues. Each dialogue has been crafted and voiced by advanced artificial intelligence to provide the most natural and modern spoken Japanese available today.</p><p>A New Standard in Language Learning</p><p>This course redefines how Japanese is taught by focusing on realistic, natural conversation. Instead of static textbook examples or overly simplified sentences, you will learn from dynamic dialogues that reflect real situations, tones, and rhythms of everyday Japanese. Each conversation is supported by full transcriptions and real-time English translations to guide your comprehension and vocabulary acquisition.</p><p>What sets this course apart is its smart use of AI technology: all dialogues are voiced by next-generation AI speakers that mimic native Japanese pronunciation with astonishing realism. The result? You get the closest experience possible to listening to native speakers, making your ear more attuned to natural pronunciation, intonation, and speech patterns.</p><p>How Each Lesson Works</p><p>Every video lesson in this course follows a two-step format to maximize learning and retention:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Natural Playback</strong> – First, the full dialogue is played once without interruptions. This is your chance to listen, absorb, and understand the rhythm and flow of natural Japanese speech in context.</p></li><li><p><strong>Listen and Repeat Mode</strong> – The same dialogue is played again, this time with short pauses after each sentence or phrase.

  "description": "<p>Hello everynone! My name is Angelika, a native Russian speaker and language teacher. I have been working in the field of online Russian lessons and training for the past 3 years. I have helped hundreds of people, from young children to mature adults, to achieve their language goals through my online lessons.</p><p>As an instructor, I make a point of always challenging my students while being a patient individual and a good listener. It is important for students to feel comfortable and have realistic and achievable goals, and I am doing my best to keep you on track with your language learning objectives. </p><p>The Russian language has six cases to show what function a noun has in a sentence: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, and prepositional.</p><p>The endings of Russian words change depending on the case they are in. It is best to learn the words and the way they sound in different cases by heart. Learning the cases is the fastest way to sound more fluent in Russian.</p><p>Each Russian case has its own purpose and answers a particular set of questions. One of the reasons that cases are so important in the Russian language is the flexibility of the Russian sentence word order. As sentences can be put together in so many ways, cases help distinguish the sentence's subject from its object.</p><p>This is a self-study course prepared by <strong>e-russkiy</strong>. <strong>e-russkiy</strong> self-study course is a flexible, low-cost way of learning Russian online in your own time, at your own speed. Improve your language level and professional communication skills. Express yourself with confidence with my online, self-study Russian courses.</p><p><strong>And also if you want you can book completely personalised online lessons, tailored specifically to your own needs from native russian professional teacher.</strong> </p><p>This course requires basic knowledge of Russian. If this is not your case, i recommend you my <strong>Complete Russian Course for Beginners (A1-A2)</strong></p><p>Let's learn to speak Russian in an efficient way.</p>",

Based on <strong>Orton-Gillingham principles</strong> (the gold standard for dyslexia-friendly instruction), my method turns abstract letter sounds into tangible, memorable skills—<em>even if your child has ADHD, dyslexia, or just \"hates reading.\"</em></p><p><strong>Why 97% of beginners FAIL at phonics (and how to fix it):</strong><br>Most courses drown kids in abstract rules. <strong>My secret?</strong> I replace confusion with <strong>kinesthetic learning</strong>—using hand motions, color-coded charts, and real-world word games that make short vowels <em>stick</em>. In <strong>Module 1</strong>, you’ll master the #1 mistake parents make (it’s NOT about memorizing letters!). By <strong>Module 3</strong>, your child will blend consonants/digraphs like <em>sh</em>, <em>ch</em>, and <em>th</em> into words like <em>ship</em>, <em>chip</em>, and <em>thin</em>—<em>without flashcards or drills</em>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here’s EXACTLY what you’ll gain:</strong><br> <strong>The \"Vowel Anchor\" Technique:</strong> Stop vowel confusion cold! Teach short vowels with foolproof hand signals (e.g., <em>“/a/ is an alligator chomp!”</em>) so kids <em>never</em> mix up <em>a/e/i/o/u</em>.<br><strong>Digraph Decoding Kit:</strong> Solve the <em>sh/ch/th/wh</em> puzzle with animated story cards (included!) that turn tricky sounds into memorable adventures.<br><strong>30-Second Blending Drills:</strong> My “Sound Sandwich” method builds fluency fast—ideal for short attention spans. (Teachers: Use these in morning warm-ups!)<br><strong>Printable Progress Tracker:</strong> Celebrate wins with a reward system that motivates reluctant readers. <em>Includes dyslexia-friendly fonts!</em></p><p><strong>This course is PERFECT if you:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Are a <strong>parent of a K-2 child</strong> drowning in “sight word lists” but still guessing at <em>cat</em> vs. <em>cot</em>.</p></li><li><p>Are a <strong>new teacher</strong> overwhelmed by phonics curricula that leave kids behind.</p></li><li><p>Have tried YouTube videos but need <strong>structured, bite-sized lessons</strong> (5-15 mins/day!) with zero prep.</p></li><li><p><strong>Worry your child has dyslexia</strong>—my multisensory approach is clinically backed for neurodiverse learners.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why I’m NOT like other instructors:</strong><br>As a <strong>certified reading specialist with 12 years in Title 1 schools</strong>, I’ve seen every phonics gap. I don’t just teach <em>what</em> to do—I show you <em>why</em> it works (and what to fix when it doesn’t). </p><p><br></p><p><strong> BONUS: Lifetime access + 30-day money-back guarantee!</strong><br><strong>Enroll now and unlock reading success in 30 days or less. Your child’s “aha!” moment is waiting.</strong></p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>This set of lessons explains how to recognise and how to use the passive voice in Latin. It begins with an explanation of how the passive voice works in English, and then applies what is already known, if not always completely understood, to Latin. All the passive forms are given in what are hoped to be user-friendly tables and carefully distinguished from their active forms. It will be seen – note the impersonal future passive construction here! – that the forms of the passive are generally based on the forms in the active voice. The final lesson covers how the passive voice is used in Latin. There is also a set of accompanying PowerPoint slides that can be downloaded and used.</p><p>The lessons form part of a growing set of courses that will eventually cover all the main grammar of Latin, together with syntax. There will be additional courses on the scansion and reading of the most common meters in Latin verse, together with lecture courses on various aspects of Greek and Roman history. Once these are in place, I will start work on a parallel set of courses to cover the main elements of Greek.</p><p><br></p><p>I use the videos already made with my language classes, where they are very popular supplements to live teaching and aids to revision. I hope they will be equally useful for impersonal learning.</p>",

  "description": "<p>    I am excited to announce to you that here comes the fifth sequel of College Spoken Chinese Fast Class: the quickest way of learning conversation Chinese. I am an award-winning professor of Chinese for 16 years at prestigious American colleges with two PhDs in Chinese and comparative language and literature. The quickest way of acquiring spoken language is the way we learned a language during our childhood: from mouth to mouth, without any written script. While without an explaining medium language, a baby has to figure out the meaning of the sentences from recurring situations, we, as adult learners, can even further enhance the speed by minimal, explaining medium language (here is English). The sequence of \"College Spoken Chinese Series: The quickest way of learning conversational Chinese\" has six courses. Each course takes you only 4 hours (30-40 minutes each day for the two dialogues of each lesson, you can finish the course in a week), the six courses will allow you to master spoken Chinese included in three year's college Chinese curriculum (without the written character requirement of course) in just 24 hours. You will be able to conduct conversation fluently in all realms of daily life, including greeting, family, time, hobbies, visit friends, make appointment, study Chinese, school life, go shopping, weather, traffic, dining, library, renting apartment, book air ticket, traveling, college students doing part-time jobs, Chinese georgraphy, environmental protection, Chinese and American festivals, health and living, the benefits and harm of computer age, children's education in China and in America, Chinese history, gender equality, etc. Not just random teaching of some key sentences in a situation, but full-body real-life conversation that encompasses exactly two year's college Chinese curriculum (based on the same range of vocabulary, grammar and situation dialogues)! This sequence can be for any new-learners of Chinese, but don't mistake it for just new learners! It is immeasurably valuable for those students who have already studied Chinese for years but need to make his pronunciation as accurate, his speech as fluent as native speakers through the teacher's all-talking head videos emphasizing the mouth shape of pronunciation, the correct tone and sentence cadence that you cannot acquire otherwise. This course is the fifrth sequel, encompass topics such as , such as college students doing part-time jobs, children's education, Chinese georgraphy, change of China, life and health, Chinese and American festivals, the content of which a college student has to learn in one full semester (without the written requirement), in five months. <br>   Each dialogue is taught in three lectures. The first lecture will teach you the meaning of each phrase and sentence in the dialogue with the help of medium language---English, but the main emphasis is to lead you speak after me through the whole dialogue as soon as you understand them. During this lecture, you may glance at the printed out PDF of the text with its pinyin text for identifying the sound with my talk-head pronunciation, particularly students who have never studied pinyin and not familiar with Chinese pronunciation. In the second lecture, I will lead you to speak through the text twice and practice the dialogue with you in a new, invented context where we act as two sides speaking the dialogue. The third lecture is an acting video in which you can review your dialogue and speak after me again. I didn't put in pinyin subtitles in the talking head videos, because I think it will distract you from recalling the full sentence you speak after me, instead, you will just spell out the pinyin one by one mechanically, without being able to duplicate the full sentence language out of your memory when you speak after me. After the first lecture, you should not even look at the PDF while speaking after me, you should speak after me like a child learning his first language---from mouth to mouth, observing the mouth shape in pronunciation, imitate the pronunciation and tones as closely as possible, draw from memory the whole sentence structure after you heard it, on the spot. That is how you can maximize the speed of learn spoken language. <br>  You will see after four hours, you are able to speak, with near native-speaker accuracy and fluency advanced level of Chinese that you have to learn in a whole semester, in five months in the classroom college Chinese curriculum (without written requirement of course). </p>",

  "description": "<p>Hello and welcome to everybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Given that China is one of the most powerful countries on the earth, it is not surprising that demand for China and Chinese is increasing on a daily basis. People often feel that learning Chinese would be difficult and are afraid to begin studying the language. However, Chinese is not as difficult to master as it seems. The characters seem menacing at first look, and they are difficult to recall. However, as you will see throughout the course and as I will often emphasize, the Chinese letters are not dissimilar in look. During the session, I will explore the characters' relationships, which will make it much easier to recall what is going on in their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>My goal with this educational series is to teach you around 100 Chinese phrases. You will see the words you have learnt in a variety of phrases, making them far more difficult to forget and much simpler to grasp. One of the most advantageous elements of learning a language via sentences is that you will be able to grasp them much more readily. We will also study sentences that you can apply in regular conversation, which means you will be able to employ the phrases we learned directly from the stories or similar words when conversing in your native language with a Chinese friend. As a consequence, you will be able to communicate more effectively.</p><p><br></p><p>Because I built this course for those with no previous experience of Chinese, you do not need to have any prior knowledge of the language. Make an attempt to grasp the terms I've addressed in the videos, and please contact me if you have any questions regarding anything you don't understand. In the future, I'll react to your queries with further videos. It's best to start by typing the letters at the beginning of the phrase. If you do this, you will be able to grasp the general structure of the characters much more rapidly.</p>",

  "description": "<p>To everyone who are reading this: hello and welcome.</p><p><br></p><p>Since China is one of the world's most formidable countries, it's no wonder that interest in China and the Chinese language is growing constantly. Many people avoid starting to learn Chinese because they think it will be too difficult. However, despite appearances, Chinese is not a particularly difficult language to master. Many people have said that the characters are scary and difficult to recall at first look. But as you'll see during the semester and as I'll keep emphasizing, the Chinese letters are visually not all that different from one another. It will be much easier to keep track of everyone's whereabouts and activities if we talk about the ties that bind them together throughout our session.</p><p><br></p><p>Approximately one hundred common Chinese phrases are my target number of words to teach you in this series. The repetition of seeing the words you've learned in context will help you retain and use the vocabulary. This is one of the greatest advantages of learning a language with sentences, since you will have a lot easier time comprehending what others are saying. We will also study conversational sentences, so that you may use the phrases we learn directly from the stories or similar words while speaking with a Chinese friend in your own language. This will allow you to convey your thoughts and ideas more clearly.</p><p><br></p><p>In other words, you don't need to know any Chinese before starting this course since I made it just for people like you. Attempt to fully grasp the terms I've covered in the videos, and don't be shy about getting in touch with me if there's anything you're still confused about. Your questions will be answered in subsequent videos. To get started, type the first few characters of the phrase. It will help you understand the characters as a whole lot more quickly.</p>",

  "description": "<p>The quizzes in this course help you review the different weak verb groups (<strong>I-נ, I-Guttural, II-Guttural, III-Guttural, I-י</strong>). We have collected <strong>441 quiz questions</strong>. You are asked to identify the correct root, stem, conjugation, person, gender, and number from a number of possible options. Only one answer is correct!</p><p>You are strongly encouraged to use your lexicon and other resources like verb paradigms.</p><p>There is a second Quiz covering the II-י\\ו, III-י, and II-III weak verb groups. Look for \"Biblical Hebrew Weak Verbs Quiz II\".</p><p>You know how important it is to recognize the elements that constitute a Hebrew verb (root and pattern) in order to find the verb form in a paradigm and in a lexicon.</p><p>During your studies of Biblical Hebrew, you have come across the basic verbal system (stems: Qal, Nifal, Piel, Pual, Hitpael, Hifil, Hufal; conjugations: Qatal, Yiqtol, Imperatives, etc.) At first, you met the regular patterns that use a strong root (e.g. כָּתַב). Thereafter, the weak roots entered the picture. As you know, they are found in the same stems and conjugations as the strong roots, but behave differently, because at least one root consonant is weak, which leads to alterations to the regular picture (e.g. dropping of a root letter, changing of the consonant nun into a strong dagesh, vowel changes around gutturals, etc.). You studied the weak verbs closely and systematically and acquired the diagnostic tools with which to parse verbs. However, and I am saying this from personal experience as a Biblical Hebrew teacher, students struggle with the identification of weak verbs long after having completed a course on them. </p><p>Take this quiz to:</p><ul><li><p>Improve recognition skills of Hebrew weak verbs</p></li><li><p>Review weak verbs</p></li><li><p>Test yourself</p></li><li><p>Gain confidence in your parsing abilities</p></li><li><p>Prepare for an upcoming exam</p></li><li><p>Revisit the Hebrew paradigms and the Hebrew lexicon</p></li></ul><p> </p><p><br></p>",

  "description": "<p>     Hello, everyone, welcome to my new course, “Chinese language, poetry creation, philosophy season 2 ”! This sequence, by far the most beautiful, in-depth course that I have designed among all my courses published on Udemy, will teach you Chinese language, poetry, and poetry creation as well as the Chinese philosophical thoughts influencing poetry creation. My five-course language sequence published on Udemy in the past year, \"college Mandarin Chinese On Your Own\" is ranked no.1 in student review and sales in the Chinese language category on Udemy. Poetry is the most beautiful, concise use of a language, and the vocabulary of modern poetry is perfectly applicable for daily use. Learning poetry and poetry creation will allow you to acquire a language at its best and in a speedy, most impressive and memorable manner. For each poem, I have made it into extremely beautiful video with pictures, music and my own recitation, which brings into resonance the artistic contagion of different mediums of art. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>    The course is divided into several sections, the first section are poems whose creation are inspired by painting: the poem of Buddhist enlightenment inspired by the paintings in the Mogao Caves; the wasted feminine youth and beauty inspired by the radically aestheticized photography of lotus flowers; Buddhist and Taoist equanimity inspired by the aesthetics of Chinese literati painting and Buddhist painting; Buddhist renunciation inspired by the oil painting of the sun of the glacial age;  the dream of transmigration conveyed in black-and-white photos of my disappeared hometown in a past time and of the River of Ganges. The second section of the course will examine comparative religion of the East and the West, and their unexpected affinity beneath apparent difference, and an unconventional understanding of sacramental ritual. The third section will examine the semiotics of photography as exile, mourning and lyrical time. The fourth section will examine the Taoist collapse of opposition implied in the emblem of the raven.</p>For learning each poem, I will give three lectures. In the first lecture, I will lead you to learn the language in the poem. I will provide vocabulary list and teach you these vocabularies perfectly applicable to daily use and how to use them on daily occasion, I will explain to you the poem's literal meaning, and lead you to recite them. In the second lecture, I will explain in English the poetic meaning, philosophical thoughts and creative process behind each poem. In the third lecture, I will give you the musical video of the poem with my recitation and pictures (and subtitles of both Chinese and English version of the poem) to further impinge on you the aesthetic appreciation and understanding of the poem, and the memorability of the beautiful language. At the end of each section. I will give you some creative writing practice that allows you to use your learned language and creative process of making a poem. After learning the course, you will feel your Chinese language soar with your aesthetic delight in the ecstatic poetic flight. I am a professor of Chinese for 16 years at prestigious American universities. All the poems are reserved for my own future publication in books, they are copyright-protected, so please don’t use them for your own authorship.\n\n  ",

I use different teaching methodologies, as well as help students in adopting effective learning approaches.</p><p><br></p><p>Some More Tips Before You Start Learning Darija</p><p><br></p><p>1. Start with the basics – focus on learning basic phrases and grammar before moving on to more difficult concepts.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes – everyone makes them when learning a new language, so don’t be discouraged if you make a few yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Practice, practice, practice – the more you use your new language skills, the better you’ll become at them. Find opportunities to practice with native speakers or other learners.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Be patient – learning a new language takes time, so don’t expect to be fluent overnight – or even have some of these words stick. Keep trying and you’ll get there eventually!</p><p><br></p><p>5. Find a good Arabic language course – there are many different ways to learn Arabic, but finding a course that suits your needs and learning style is important.</p><p><br></p><p>Moroccan Darija is extremely hard to teach yourself for several reasons. The lack of training materials for the language is one primary reason. But another reason is that, particularly for English speakers, the way Darija is written does not sound like it is spoken. This makes informal education and self-learning very difficult. </p><p><br></p><p>Another tricky thing to consider, particularly for English speakers, is that there are many sounds in Darija that are very difficult to pronounce, especially without a lot of practice. There is often an unintuitive emphasis on syllables that can only really be learned by hearing it, speaking it, and receiving instruction from a teacher or tutor. Moroccan Darija Lessons tend to be more important than traditional lessons for other languages.</p>",
